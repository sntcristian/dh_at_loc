# DH Activities at the Library of Congress (LOC)

Today a workshop was carried in the Library of Congress in order to survey the curation pratices inside LOC.

In this repository, you can find some playarounds that were done in the afternoon using data from [data.lab.loc.gov](data.lab.loc.gov).
Specifically, you can find: 
* a [wordcloud](wordcloud.jpg) extracted from the records of the spirituralist Fred Hockley using Voyant Tools
* an [image](stable_diffusion.webp) generated using Stable Diffusion from one of Fred Hockley's records of spiritual visions
* a [plot of the most frequent places](places.png) contained in Rosa Parks' papers
* a [plot of the most frequent person names](people.png) references in Rosa Parks' papers
* a [social network]("people_network.html") that shows connection between personalities in Rosa Parks' papers based on text co-occurence.

This repository contains material that can be used for didactic purposes.
There is no intention to use the material in this repository to support scholarly statements.

New information that still is to be extracted may appear in the repository in future.
