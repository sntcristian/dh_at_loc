Do you know what is called the palinganesia
of plants.
3211  It can be done but not without 
endangering the Soul
What are the best purposes to which we can turn
this curious Phenomena of Seeing in the Crystal 
& Vessels of Water

Can we adapt those Tables to our present purposes
13.
3217 I have already told you that you
could not adapt it without endanging
the soul
Can so simple a thing as figures endanger the
soul

Can you tell me how it is that E.S. & me receive
Such discordant answers to the same questions
3228 Are you quite sure they are the same spirits

3230 If that was said to Tescho he would say
no reliance can be placed on Orion

Are you the Angel of my planet Yes
     3291     Yes

Will you please to tell me the name that my
Seer may be read it

hes gone 5'
Hunder appeared without the mask over his eye & 
so luminous that Emma was obliged to place the 
Crystal on the other Table & as much as possible in
the dark & he appeared very much pleasanter than
ever she saw him.
26
Invoked Hunder  Ex 3 times
He is here in blue, his eyes open, he has black eyes
rather smooth short hair brushed up, he appears
very luminous, as tho the light is inside of him.
Will you please to answer me some questions
3293 Yes
How can I tell when spirits give true answers or not
3294 You should exorcise them three times
Have you ever appeared in ES's crystal

Do you know Emanuel Swedenborg who formerly

When I call him into this crystal to obtain
answers, are those answers given by him or by

Are you my Guardian Spirit in consequence of my
having been possessed of that crystal
  3304  Yes
Would you have been my GS if I had never had that
crystal
  3305  No I should not
Is Tescho the GS of ES + a good + truthful spirit
    3306       I think the difference in the answers
      arise from his being the spirit of that
       crystal
Is he a good spirit
 3307  No answer
Is he a good + truthful spirit
  3308 No answer

should have preferred asking questions -- but will
not do so against your wish

Soul

Japan Crystal
To see ES
1/4 to 11 PM "He cannot appear tonight"
3327 To see Mr Anderson
instantly / hes here
When did you inspect your crystal last
3328 This afternoon at 4. (hes winked at Selina)
Did you ever use a common looking glass
to have visions in
3329 No did you
After some banter with Selina I asked him if he
could tell us any thing curious in the occult way
Mr A said - she's a shocking temper.
30
He said
3330 Have you visited Jerusalem, I have 
visited the place where the Secret Society's
meetings are held under the Temple
You have to go down a great many
subterranean passages to get to it.
Since [a name?] work has been published
Its so commonly known I wonder their meetings
have not been suppressed.
3331 Why they do no harm
No but the Illuminati & Masonic Societies are
so cordially hated(?) by the clergy in all climes
3332 True
We had a Vision of one of their meetings on
Sunday but the president spoke a language
we could not understand
3333 he spoke in Hebrew I suppose
I do not know Emma could not copy the
letters
3334 Have you heard from Lord Stanhope yet
No
3335 Its very strange have you called
Sally but I suppose you have.
No will you call her
3336  I will stay here but you call her, she
Can tell you surely how he is.
Called Miss Cook
3337 She is engaged
We are disappointed you See
3358 I am sorry for it, I asked this afternoon
"CONTO"
31
             if Louis Napoleon would  Ever marry &
             I was informed he would do it, thats a
             Choker for him. /See folio 42 3386/
Is your G.S. and the Spirit of your Crystal the
same
   3337   I think not. The Archangel Michiel
               is my G.S.
Who is the spirit of your Crystal then
   3340   The spirit called "Conto"
because I have been informed by Hunder that
he is my G.S. in consequence of my becoming
possessed some 15 or 16 years ago of my small
oval crystal and that he would not otherwise have  
been my G. S. When he last appeared he 
was very luminous
   3341     I like them to appear so, you see
                 them longer, but when you see them 
                 in the mirror you only see them to the 
                 shoulder. They are then the size of life
                 & you can see each separate hair, the 
                 size alone is startling. I hope you have
                 secured a pleasant vision for the first.
Yes the CA has promised to appear.
We then had a chat & he promised if possible
to be at the Lyceum on Thursday next as I told
him we should be there.
He then left. 10' past 11 PM.

   We were prevented keeping our appointment in
consequence of the Lyceum being full & we went to 
Drury Lane instead.

51 Do they ever sleep
3342 No they do not
52 Are they always happy
3343 Yes
53 How do they in general amuse themselves
3343 How do you mean.
It's a question propounded by ES. I presume his Lordship
means "in what does their happiness consist."
3345 In things which a mortal cannot understand.
54 Have they any communications with the Spirits of 
other planets
3346 Yes
55 Are they in great numbers
3347 Yes they are
56 Can they move whenever they like

planets

   Here is one dressed in Crimson, like Crimson velvet 
or beautiful Crimson Cloth, very light curled hair

up and then entered the crystal
May I ask your name
   3352    The Archangel Michiel
Will you please to enter the crystal
   3353 Why do you wish me to [ansr] enter the 
              Crystal I can answer as well here.
Will you answer my questions truly without entering 
the crystal
I said now he has come in. Ex. 3 times
Can you tell me how am I to obtain true answers

did you not inform him that you gave answers
obtained from Emannuel Swedenborg.
3361     Yes but the were given to me.
Are any of the Spirits that appear in Crystals
capable of delivering Poetry
3362     No
If Lord Byron was invoked into this Crystal wd
he not be able to deliver a poem to us
3363     No I think not. they lose that love
             they had for those things on this earth.

No I have not. I should much like to see him
When can I see him

Will you request him to appear when you leave
3365     he will leave in ten minutes after I leave the Crystal
have you any objection to appear in this Crystal
3366     I would rather communicate by Rappings
I am afraid that would alarm my young friends
Now he's leaving he's gone

Emma's G.S.

3372 Because Low was appointed
Is Low a good and faithful G.S.
3373 Yes
Was he appointed her GS in Consequence of my
having the crystal which came from Japan
3374 I believe he was. 
Can you tell me why E.S. and I obtain such
discordant answers

             Called Mr Anderson
here he is and a lot of reading
              Catch me going any where to meet you
3379      again. I  I look in  the passage there for
              2 hours and you never came near the
              place, then I went off to the 
              Haymarket & looked in there I think you
              meant to deceive me.
We went to the Lyceum & after waiting a long time in
the passage -We were informed the house was full so
We went to Drury Lane. we did not to see you in the
passage
              I mean the passage behind the boxes thats

What pieces did you see
I saw the phenomenon in a smock
frock. A part of the good woman in the 
Wood.  I did not stop at the Haymarket
the extravaganza was going on.  I did 
not buy a bill.
Georgy very much wanted to go, but 
I would not take her. for if she once gets
in any where I am boxed for the whole
evening and I cannot sit still any where
How is E.S.
ES is very well but he begins to cease having any
interest in the crystal he obtains such discordant
answers.
And cant tell the reason I suppose
so nor I either
Oh.
What do you think thereon
I never pry into other peoples affairs
Thats nothing to do with his obtaining true answers is it
ES came into my crystal last Sunday
evening at 1/2 past 11 you also appeared
How did I appear
In a smock frock but you cannot
summon me that way because I saw
your collar & handf. on the table
Why don't you know what it was
A smock frock I suppose I don't know
when you got it tho
Why I only put my night shirt on over my clothes
for a bit of fun with Mrs. L & her daughters
Michael was dressed in white & white wings very fair
long curls and beautiful hands -- no feet seen
38
Emma's very poorly again, and I want to enquire
what will do her good
3382 have you asked the Spirits
Yes but neither gave me any answer.
3383 I will ask on Sunday Evening - I want 
to speak to Miss but you must give it
her (Selina) to read.
Selina took the crystal & saw Mr A plainer than
she ever saw him before & some reading but could
not make it out. Mr A promised to come again
on Tuesday. - Selina inspected & saw also a Lady
with a scarlet cloak & then taking the E.S. Crystal

Japan Crystal
20' to 12 PM To see Mr. Anderson
Instantly. here he is in plain clothes his crystal
in his hand He says
3399 There's a woman here. I know her tho' 
I don't know what she wants, wherever
she appears misfortune follows, that 
is wherever she goes it does so, and I
don't half like her appearing here
What is her name
3400 Agnes Maculey
I never knew her touch an Animal
bird or any thing living but what it
died afterwards. She is a strange creature
I don't know where she lives
Is she very handsome   fair hair  very dark eyes.
3401 Theres a sort of fascinating air about 
her. I had a beautiful dog & was
walking one day in the street & she 
passed me I just staid & spoke to her
She patted the dog on the head  the dog
was quite well at the time but 3 days
after the dog died, it is strange, is it not
Has she very fair hair & dark eyes
3402 Yes she has, her eyes are very wild
they resemble Count Cagliostro's more
than any I ever saw--she is such a 
malicious creature  2 or 3 children 
have died after being touched her  she 
has a peculiar way of touching any
one on the spine near the back of the
head connected with the brain
46
Is she now living in London
3403 I met her in London about 6 months ago
but the last time I heard of her she
was in Somersetshire I judge her age
about 8 or 9 & 20
She is certainly a curious acquaintance
3404 Her power does not extend over persons 
of a certain age I believe
About what age is that
3405 Well I should say about 16 or 14 or
may be younger
Then I hope no one about me may ever see her
3406 I like to see such people she is here
now
Ask her what she has come for I could not get her
or prevail upon her to speak.
3407 I have asked her but she wont answer
You dont get acquainted with such
people I suppose
Is she a nymph
3408 O no she's a widow at least so she
says, but how far her character goes
I cant say. I wish you would ask
her what she wants
Shall I call her into my crystal for the
Purpose
3409 Could you on Tuesday evening
Yes
3410 Then I will wish you good night
He's gone

[Mars symbol] die Feb [3] 1st 1853
25' past 7 Invoked the C.A.
The CA is here but not in the crystal -- now the CA's
entered the crystal in his usual (male) form
How many questions may I ask
3411 Ten
ES's queries contd.
59. By whom are the names given to the spirits
of the Sun.
3412 AA. Hershiel
What is the name of the Highest spirit of [of]
the sun.
3413 Octova
61 When the spirits of the deceased leave the atmosphere
do they go to any intermediate place before they go
a planet 
3414 The good ones do
62 When a clairvoyant is in a state of trance does
the soul leave the body
3415 The spirit that animates the body 
leaves it not the soul.
63 When a clairvoyant is not in a state of trance how
does the soul [leave the body] receive information
3416 They do not receive information then
64 When a clairvoyant is not in a state of trance 
does the soul leave the body
65 Do all the spirits of the Sun come from earth
or do some of them come from other planets
3417 They come from different places
66 Can all good spirits wear crowns when they
like it
48
3418 No they cannot.
67 By whom are angels appointed
     3419  By one mightier than all
68 Are Angels ever removed to another planet
   3420  Angels do not dwell on planets at all
69 Are there any spirits higher than those of the
Sun
  3421  Angels are higher
70  do angels that are spirits of the Sun ever
leave it /-/
Mr WD is very anxious about his Son WD will you
please to tell me how he is or shall I ask
Almondio
   3422  Almondio is not his GS
will you please to tell me who is his GS
  3423  I will enquire
will you please to send him into the crystal
  3424  No answer
Why have we such difficulty in obtaining visions of
persons who are in America.
 3425  Spirits of all kind have a great dislike
    to cross the water
our Chief wish is to know if WD is alive & well of
course we do not wish his spirit to cross the water if
it is detrimental to him.
  3426  I will enquire & send you the information
       in half an hour
he's gone 20' to 8.
The C.A. closed his wings at the back to leave the
crystal -
49
5' to 8 PM. Invoked Almondio
          No vision
10' past 8.
 There is a greenleaf like a  leaf + some reading
on it its getting longer
 3427      "He is alive Well"
       Invoked Almondio
        No vision
Now the crystal is clouding + theres some reading line
  3428  "If you part with your small crystal
            of which Hunder is the spirit the CA
              has expressed a wish to become your
              Guardian Spirit
Shall I break it up
3429  No
How shall I dispose of it
  3430  By giving it to any one who has not a
              crystal
I will do so then
           By having the CA for your GS the
          visions that come in the crystal would
3431    be clearer I mean the spiritual visions
             + none but good spirits would be allowed
            to appear
             You could dismiss Hunder from it
            + make it into any ornament you pleased
Would Hunder have any objection to be released from it
  3432         No he would not
50
If Hunder is released from it may I have it made
into an ornament for my Seer
3433 Yes then nothing will appear in it after
By what means shall I get Hunder released from
it
3434 By a form which I the CA will give
you on Sunday evening
1/4 to 9. Invoked Almondio
Here is one come. Ex. 3 times
Will you please to inform me your name
3435 Almondio
Are you the GS of Mr. WG Dresser
3436 Yes. I see him in that light
If WGD obtains a crystal will you appear in it
3437 A looking glass will answer as well 
or a bottle of water.
Will be able to see or obtain a Seer
3438 Only one person in a thousand will be 
able to see in [t] it
Can you tell me who that person is
3439 The woman that appeared in that
crystal (Lows) on Sunday evening.
Will my wife Ann Dresser see in it
3450 No
Will my sister in law Albina
3457 No
Will either of my children
3452 No they will not
Will any of those persons I have named see in 
a bottle of water.
51
3453    They have not the gift of seeing spirits in
anything
I have an earnest desire to investigate this subject
will you please to tell me what means I had better
pursue
3454   First pursue a looking glass then I will
inform you form this crystal who
 will be able to see in it
Who is she
3455 Susan Macaley
Where shall I find her
he's gone.
9h:12 PM. To see Mr. Anderson
Here he is -- My friend Mr Dresser has been informed
that Susan Macaley can see in the crystal
Is she any relation or sister of Agnes
because I know that Agnes can see it of
a crystal.
But such a dangerous acquaintance is by no means 
to be coveted
3457 You recollect calling Josepha Sozzio
You remember I enquired after a little
child -- I have reason to believe
that that woman was the cause of
her death. When she was a baby.
Will you allow Mr D to look into the crystal to see
if he can see you
Mr D has inspected but cannot see any thing
3458 I had a great wish for him to see me
knowing him to be so anxious
52
Shall I call Agnes Macaley to come in will you 
stand on one side.
3459 Do you think we should be any harm
I know nothing about it I only call her to please
you I would rather have nothing to do with her 
3460 Very well then we shall not call her, have
you got your glass yet -- Selina will be 
able to see a certain gentleman then
I suppose you intend to call living
persons in as well as spirits but I must
warn you not to call dead persons in
they appear so plain & ghastly, I would
advise you to call only high spirits &
live persons, above all do not call Orion
I am told he is a wandering spirit. I 
can assure you the forms of good &
evil sometimes appears terrible - one thing
[blank space] has spirits robes or appear 
with wings I thought it was right to 
tell you.
We had a short chat and he left.
11h:15' PM. Emma took up Lows crystal without
my calling then appeared a bright star which shone
out rays and a wreath of bay leaves appeared tied
with blue ribbons then in the middle of the wreath
a spirit appeared in blue very fair haired & beautiful
Will you please to tell me your name
3461 Oviniah
Of what planet are you the spirit
3462 (drawing)
53
Do you know the CA who appeared tonight in my crystal
3463 Yes
Do you know Hunder the spirit of my Crystal My G.S.
3464 Yes 
Which would be the best for a G.S.
3465 The Crowned Angel
Why have you come uncalled
3466 When I appeared before you wished me to appear again
We are always happy when good spirits appear
Will you give us some advice which will be of service
to us
3467 You are not in want of any
Shall I do well in having Hunder released from my 
small Crystal & having the CA for my GS instead
3468 Yes indeed shall you see Hunder tonight.
He's gone.  24' past 11.
Invoked Hunder
Hunder is here.
May I ask you some questions
3469 Yes
Is it your wish to be dismissed from my small 
crystal.
3470 Yes
Shall I thereby release you from being my G.S.
3471 Yes - you will release me and yourself
be more confident
I hope you will not be offended at my doing so
3472 No I shall not
The Wings were closed to enter but spread out when in & Emma
remarked that the face still more resembled a woman than
a man so soft in the expression yet placid as tho chiselled
out of marble.
54
But perhaps I may do wrong in so doing how am I
to be convinced I am right in so doing
3473     It is much better for the CA to be your
GS.
Shall I release you then next Sunday
3474     Yes.
will you appear to me after If I call you for advice
3475     Certainly I will.
He's gone.  20' to 12 PM

(symbol) die 1, Feb. 1853
10.30 PM.    Invoked the C. A.
The CA is here in white -- wings as [?]
Will you inform me how am to proceed to release
Hunder from being my GS.
3476     If you discharge the Crystal of which
Hunder is the Spirit 3 times at the
Same time mentally thanking him
for all the good actions he has performed
for you & wishing him to appear in
your other Crystal he will then cease to
be your Guardian Spirit, and you
will then cease to look in the Crystal
for the purpose of Divining but he will
always appear & give you the informn.
you require in your other Crystals

I will do so on Tuesday will if be necessary for my
Seer to be present when I do it
3477     No
55
On Tuesday you will have the glass will
You not — I have promised you I will
be the first to Appear in it
I thank you I beg you will at all times keep anything
from it that will alarm my Young Seer. or be injurious
to her health.
3478   I will do so
Lieut. Benton has promised to visit me for some information
I promised to give him will you tell me the name
of his G.S.
3479   I will enquire
May I in future address you as my GS
3450 Yes.
On what evenings do you prefer appearing 
3481   On Tuesdays + Sundays
Are you able to answer my Questions when I propose
them Mentally.
3482   In some cases I can do so. but my
Power is limited
I know a Seeress named Woodward who foretells
things about to happen can you tell me by what
means she does that.
3483  She sees them in her crystal but they are not
Sent by good Spirits, Evil Spirits have a
great deal more power than good ones
When you do me the favor to appear in this Crystal
how long may I be allowed to ask you to stop
3484   I cannot tell time
My reason is because you so frequently disappear before
I am able to offer you my thanks
3485  But you intend to do it, + that quite
satisfies me.
This is very remarkable in as much it has reference to the
questions NC proposed by ES -- See pages     &
but which I had not once thought of during the day or indeed
for several days.
56
In my earnest enquiries after Spiritual information
I may ask questions which are not proper. May
offend tho unintentionally—this I should and will regret
3486 There are some questions which I cannot
make you understand even if I answered
them.
The questions of what Spirits eat &
drink. I cannot make you understand
as they have the nourishment of food
without tasting it.— And their amusement
to you would not be amusement. it is in
things which you could not comprehend
Sometimes I answer but cannot
Put my Answers into words.
The CA's getting smaller, he's gone
12' to 11 PM.

5' to 11 PM. Invoked Hunder
Hunder is here in blue & very bright
Are you aware I have been advised to release You
from the Small Crystal I possess
3487   Yes
Is it your wish that I should do so
3488   Yes
Will you then cease to be my G.S.
3489   Yes
I hope your ceasing to be my GS. has not arisen from
Any offence given by me
3490  No it is not. did you then think the CA
was not as high as myself—
57
No it was not that but from our Education & consequent
ignorance of Spiritual matters, we are afraid of doing
any thing which may be prejudicial to the Soul.
3491  If you would much rather, I would remain
your GS I will do so
I must leave that of course in the hands of God
3492 All things are guided by Him.
He's gone 11 PM.

11 PM Invoked Constantine
Here he is in white with wings, no stones.
My Seer Emma's back is bad will you tell me any
thing to do her good.
3493 Mesmerism would.
Who had better mesmerise it.
3494 You had but she would prove clairvoyant
Would that not be prejudicial to her health
3495 No
Now he's gone.
Why has Constantine departed so hastily
3496 "he was called"

1/4 past 11 PM. Invoked Low.
He is here.
My Seer Emmas back is very bad, will you tell me
what will do her good
Emma s.d   he looks so curious & shakes his head.
Do you think my mesmerizing her advisable
3497 It would be advisable as far as curing 
her spine is concerned
58
would it have any injurious tendency to her spiritual 
welfare. 
3498 I don't know whether she would prove 
Clairvoyant - If she did not it would 
do her a great deal of good & no harm 
Would proving Clairvoyant be injurious to her Soul
3499 I do not know. 
Should I enquire of a Clairvoyant. Alexis Didier 
for instance if mesmerizing her her would be good
3500 You could not do better.
I thank you. 

Japan Crystal
25' Past 11 PM.
Called Mr. Anderson
Here he is with his Crystal in his hand & his Chain 
round his neck. He says 
3501 I have a man here I will tell you something 
very curious about him when he is gone. 
What's his name. 
3502 M. Dupuis
Oh that's a spirit (a deceased Mortal)
3503 O no its not that one, its a French Vagabond 
Where Are you now in London or Paris
3504 I am in London
Now he's looking in his Crystal again
Do you take minutes of your apparitions in the Crystal
3505 I cannot if I was to write it would take 
my attention off the Crystal & I can't get 
any one else to do it as I don't want any 
one to know I have got one.
I take all mine down Someday I want to have the
59
pleasure of showing them to you

3506 
I hope so
he is gone, he's come back now hes sitting in a black chair
with Square high back & green cushion. - he says

3507
I was travelling in Germany not the last
time but the time before when you saw me
and during my travels I met with a Gent.n
who was travelling We became acquainted 
both seeking pleasure we went on & visited
several places together, one day I asked
why he did not stay at the same Hotel 
with me but he made some Evasive reply 
we went about to several places together
I should say about 6 weeks Constant Compan.s
every day, about that time we had some 
high words about an English Lady of my 
acquaintance, he took her character away 
and that was Lady Adelaide Vane the 
daut. of the Marquis of Londonderry & I of 
course did not know any thing bad of her 
then and took her part - that went over
and then we quarrelled about something 
else & we parted with very high words
Previous to that he had expressed a
wish to visit England with me & I of course 
said I should be very happy We were 
coming over together. That was about a 
month before we quarrelled. & a 
week after that I was to leave------- 
when I got home. I thought it over again 
& I thought we had been too hasty and I was
60
3507 Quite willing to allow that the great part
was my fault + I was willing to make it up           
in a Gentlemanly way and that I should
leave for England on Saturday if he wished
to accompany me well I did not receive
a letter on the next day until it was late
in the evening when a note came to say that 
indisposition prevented him from accomp.
him to England that he had forgotten about
the quarrell and that we parted excellent
friends That being Friday + I being to                      
leave on Saturday I had not time to see
him-- Wed I came over to England +
went to my Fathers  and about 6 weeks
after that I was stopping at a Gentlemans
House in the Country and I dreamt that
a letter from this man was [?] for me
at my Fathers, I had not been thinking
of him for some time -- when I got home
the following day sure enough there was a
note but it was not signed--initialed--
but I think I have it in  my pocket now
here he opened a letter
3508  "Mr--- is requested to meet a Gentleman 
at-- on Friday Evening at 1/2 past 8
but if the cannot meet at that time he 
is requested to meet him on Saturday at
1/2 past 9 of in answer sent to-
the party will expect him"
 Thats all the fine note contained well
61
I showed it to Georgy - she laughed and I 
laughed too, little did I think it came from 
this man. still I dreaded going, I never had 
such a dread of any thing in my life. I tried
to reason my self out of it, I thought if it was 
Allen he wd have signed the letter, and then I 
thought he was up to some mischief, and wanted
to make a fool of me -- well that night we went
to bed as usual & again I dreamt that I saw
a cross road & standing under the Hedge
was a man with a great coat & stick & the
instant I saw his face I recognized it as the
Frenchmans - it to me appeared that I
passed him on horseback without his knowing
it & as I was passing him I heard him say
as if in a passion "If that Anderson was here 
now I'd shoot him" - and sure enough
when I came down to Breakfast Georgy
told me she had dreamt the same dream
only the man on horseback was dressed as a 
footman. - I laughed and thought what
a fool I was - That was on the Friday
& I thought whoever he was he should bring
her the [morrow?] night, all day I had such a
presentiment that something was wrong, I
could not settle down to any thing and
Georgy was as bad & then we both laughed at
each other - I didn't like to be thought a
Coward by not going Yet to tell the Truth
I was afraid to go - 
The Saturday came it was a pouring
62
3509 wet day—I waited & waited until ten minutes
past the time, I was then in a Castle Inn,
pouring wet so I had a horse saddled out of
the stables a great thing more like a cart horse
than a riding horse & I hadn't a great coat in
the world to put on & I was afraid to go as I
was so I got the Coachmans Coat with
3 capes & [?] to be very Economical didnt want
me to put on a New hat, & I was very glad of
An excuse & put the footmans hat with a
cockade in it & away I went I got a little
way down the road and I could swear
I heard a voice say "You are warned not
to go." but what was my astonishment
on arriving at the cross roads to find it
was the same I had dreamt about. & under
the hedge was a man with a Spanish
Cloak.—Whom I at once recognized for
the Frenchman—it was my intention
if it was Allen to tell him the joke
if it was the Frenchmans to ride on, it was
a quarter past the time, as I passed
the man he looked very suspicious at me
I then heard him say "If that Anderson
was here I would not only rob him but
shoot him "
Is it not curious Mr Hockley that
I had that presentiment..—The next opporty.
I called him into the Crystal & he then
said he had called me out for the purpose
of robbing & perhaps murdering me and
63
that two or 3 of his Associates were behind
the Hedge but not finding me come on
the 2nd night he told me those were the
hands he made use of. What was the
fine gentleman I got acquainted with
in my Travels -- Good night.

Don't go yet

3510 O I am in no hurry. I thought you
Wanted to go to bed (2' to 12 PM)
heres Georgy come, he wants her to look in his Crystal
She says "No Thanky" she has a low necked dress
on & short Sleeves- pink dress, she is so short & stout.
Pray Mr A what do you think of the Empress-
And how long do you think she'll remain so
3511 I say two years and I told her so too
What in the crystal
3512 Yes but I have personally seen her out
of the crystal and conversed with her
She has very fascinating manners
Do you know when she was educated
3513 I think when very young in England
but after that time near Brussels
most of the descriptions given of her are
not at all correct -- her beautiful
Auburn hair is quite a yellow I wonder
if she could compare her lovely Eyes with
Fanny Howards.
It is reported Miss Fanny has purloined some state letters
3514 It was not her that took the letters
It was [and] done under the Superintendence 
of the Countess of Cl    & then shouldered
on Fanny Howard.
64
The Empress is very deep, when their heads are
laid together I dont know what they'l do
he was bad enough before.
3515  I should very much like you to see
Fanny Howard She is a very beautiful
Woman. Can't you see her in the crystal
O I forgot you cant see. The Empress is all
very well till she opens her mouth, but when
she shows her gums that spoils her.
I wonder where the other lady is packed
off to I mean Adelaide - the one that
called herself in your crystal Caroline
Is that the Lady who called herself Caroline Martin
3516 Yes they came into my crystal but I
happened to know the Lady. She could           
not deceive me.
     Good night I will come again when
you have got a spare half hour,

      The C. A. Mirror
8 PM
     Invoked the Crowned Angel:
After a very long time the C. A appeared. I was
afraid, this being the first time of our using the
67
Mirror. Emma might fear the large size of the
objects - become alarmed. but the Crowned Angel
with great kindness appeared Very Slowly, Emma
remarked that the furniture in the room reflected
of course in the glass gradually became indistinct
then it vanished and she no longer saw herself
And the whole glass appeared misty suddenly
a Veil came down from the top. & immediately
Emma began to observe the C.A. gradually
becoming more distinct the outline only appearing
at first then the head & wings gradually appeared
more distinctly and finally the Crowned Angel
Appeared plainly - very fair hair dark & exceedingly
blue eyes dark eyebrows & dark eyelashes. straight
forehead and nose and the wings which were
a delicate pink or rather Flesh color appeared as
tho feathered. the dress white & girded round the
Middle with a band of topaz stones, looking like
fire. & the dress fell in large folds The C. A
appeared so luminous that we put out the
candles and stood in front of the Fire so that the
Room was as dark as we could make it. at
the back of the C.A. appeared Red Curtains lined
with Shining stars - The C A had a golden ornament
of some kind round the head partly hidden by
the hair.
I have released Hunder from my Small Crystal
Will you now become my Guardian spirit
68
Lieut Benton is about proceeding to Arabia + thence
to India will it be desirable to have the Magic
Mirror I am going to make for him or will the small
crystal be enough
   3518   It will be desirable to have the black

We had a long chat about Miss Green, & he said
 3535       Sometime ago she came into my crystal
I didn't call the old hag.
he then related some conversation which took place
which he wrote in his book & afterwards tormented
The old lady by showing it to her. We had a long
 chat and he left.
The C A always comes through & down from the top into
the Crystal & turns around & faces me. thus showing
his side face to Emma.
[?] 13 Feb. 1853.                  E S Crystal
25' to 11 PM           Smoked the CA
3536     "He will appear in eight minutes."
McC A is here as usual
Will you please tell me the name of Lieut Burton's GS
3537   Octavus
Will he appear in this crystal on Tuesday  Evg next
3538   Yes
Are there more spirits than one  having the same name
3539   One can have two  names but not two one
because the names given to ES  on his crystal so
often differs from those given in mine
3540   The same spirits cannot appear in two
Crystals.
did you then never appear in Earl Stanhopes crystals
3541  No
did you not tell me some time ago that you had
sometimes appeared therein.
3542  Not since I have been your G S if I
did at all.
Can you tell me the name of the Highest spirit
of the Sun
3543 I will enquire
hes gone
Asked the spirit of the crystal if we should see the CA
again this evening
3244  Yes
11 PM The C. as returned
      3545 Convivan the AA.
Make it quick a different name from the one given
 to Earl Stanhope
72
 3546 The spirits that appear in Lord Stanhopes
 crystal are mostly spirits of Fire, and
 they are not good & truthful spirits
Of what order are you a spirit
 3547 Of Hades but I can enter all planets
When I am in great mental anxiety & call upon you
for advice mentally by what name shall I apply
to you
 3548 The Crowned Angel:
There is a spirit called the Crowned Angel who appears
in Earl Stanhopes crystal & who he invokes by that name
 3549 I will enquire who it is the reason
 why there is such a  
 discordance in the answers is Teeanse
 Tescho is an evil spirit and he is the 
 GS of Earl Stanhope also.
Cannot he have his GS changed, as he investigates
this mystical subject only to obtain truth
 3550
 Does he wish it changed, how can you
 Convince him that he is an evil spirit
I do not know can you suggest me a mode
 3551 No I cannot
Could you ask some good & truthful spirit to
appear uncalled in his crystal and give him
that information
 3552 I cannot at present, the questions
answered by the spirits who appear in
Earl Stanhopes crystal are so frivolous
and so avoiding that alone shows
them to be Evil. Have you not noticed
them.
73
From Swedenborgs life
page 103 Swedenborg says "All angels and spirits have 
once been men upon some planet, there is no direct
creation of angels but every celestial inhabitant has
risen according to his [?] from the ranks of mankind"
Is Swedenborg right in that assertion

3533 It is so in the case of the inferior angels
but not of the highest, the spirit 
Constantine lived upon earth 300 years
ago.

page 107
"That a great Judgment of Spirits or Souls of Mankind
dwelling in "Hades" or the intermediate state took place in 1757.--
Is that the case

3554 No it was not
In some things he is right but in
many he is wrong

page 110
Since 1757 no one is allowed to remain in the spirit
world more than 30 years whereas previously to that 
event many had been there for centuries
is that correct

3555 No it is not, they stay there till they are 
purified for a better state

page 113.
Good and evil spirits are attendant upon every man
he receives from them all his thoughts & emotions. the
good are ever busy forming [intendences?] to virtue & intellect not
power to apprehend & execute it -- The evil spirits are
always attempting to drug us with contrary influences

Lieut Burton
"It is not to be supposed that the people of Alexandria
could look upon my phials & pillboxes, without a yearning for 
their contents, an Indian doctor, too, was [?elly]for them;
Franks they despised but a man who had come so far from
the west! Then there was something infinitely seducing in the 
character of a magician doctor & fakir, each admirable of
itself, thus combined to make "great medicine" men women &
children besieged my door by which means I could see the
people face to face, & especially the fair sex- even respectable
[?] after witnessing a performance of x "Mandal" and the
Magic Mirror opined that the stranger was a holy man
gifted with supernatural powers and knowing every thing"
But the leader must not be led to suppose that I
acted "Caraban" or "Sangrado" without any knowledge of my
trade. From youth I have always been a dabbler in
medical and mystical study."
Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to El Medinah
and Meccah. [?] R. F. Burton Lieut Bombay Army

x Mandal is that form of Oriental divination which owes its
present celebrity in Europe to Mr Lane." Note.

5th Nov. 1855
"Jaundice & Burtons complaints are common & the former
is popularly cured in a peculiar way, the sick man looks
into a pot full of water, Whilst the exorciser making a certain
spell draws the heads of two needles from the patients ears
along his eyes down his face lastly dipping them into water
which at once becomes yellow-- others have "Mirayat"
magic mirrors on which the patient looks & cures the complaint

After the vision disappeared the CA said
3638  You have often wished me to inform you
how you should ascertain the good and
truthful spirits from the evil over which
appear in yours and Lord Stanhopes crystals
When they appear you should ask them 
to show you the letters on the Stone that
fastens the front of their robes.
If those letters are       they are the
highest spirits of all.
The next are       Those are the angels
of Hades.

Those of _______ are the Angels of death, 
Those of ______ and _____ are the spirits 
of the Sun and Moon
Those of _____ and ______ are the spirits 
of Fire & Water
If it is not of either of these letters the 
Spirits that appear are Evil 
You should write lo Lord Stanhope

in Scotland
--
I know most places in Scotland
Can you tell us something to amuse us this winter
evening
3673 I will tell you what I was going--
Sometime ago I went to an evening party
and met a young lady there whom I had
known for some time past, but previous to
this I had been anxious to know who she wd.
marry and inspected my crystal and then saw
he was to be at this evening party -- he was
rather an old man but not a gentleman
of much fortune, and not handsome but
however, they said they should see me at this
evening party -- I here saw an old gentleman
at least a gentleman of 50, exactly answering 
this ones description, the young lady was there
and I went up to her and as the gentleman
passed I said in 3 years time you will
have 2 children & thats the papa of
them. O nonsense Mr Anderson she said
is it likely -- I never said a word about
91
their marrying well I said I was sure of it
and she bet me a pair of gloves it would
not take place and went off very much annoyed
not [crossed out] 3 months after that she was
married to the said Old Gentleman and
when I called last she had a little boy &
when I asked for the gloves she shuffled it
off, and said I never said any thing about
her marrying - it's just like the women
I believe they begrudge any one sixpence

3674 then I had better come myself & the gloves wd.
do for the wedding, Women are mean creatures
if I had not been too quick she would have 
been at me for the gloves
Where's the piano Miss (to Selina) -- turned
up her nose at a £25 piano
They would want three haporth of tape
for a penny. even if they burnt the extra
half yard when they got home.
Our cook had an old capwoman in the
kitchen the other day wanting a 2/6 cap
for 1/9 when she came up her stairs I asked
who got a half crown cap for 1/9 - She's
been to the shop for her things ever since
Now the housemaids come
3675 heres your favorite - one of Miss Green's
maids went off about 3 months ago & she's not
been heard of yet, it was in the papers, it was
the youngest I think she's about 22. They
have no idea where she's gone to.
Our supper was just at this moment ready but not a
word had been said about it -- it was being prepared
in an adjoining room.
92
Can't you call her into your crystal
3676 I never thought of it, I will call her in bye bye
She had a sage colored gown & black mantle
any one would know her by her peculiar 
walk her aunt lived in Bedford Sheet
at the time. Go to supper.
hes gone 10 PM.

On Wednesday the 23 Feb I had taken my Japan
crystal to be mounted on an 8 sided agate handled holder with
silver cap and rim around the crystal as opposite which is the
Real Size [Son?] Saturday I obtained it back - about 1/2 past
10 PM Selena took the crystal up which I had not charged
and said here are several things in but I cannot make
them out & handed the crystal to Emma who immediately
said it is full of things but very indistinct -- now theres
some flags 12 in number Now they are falling down
there's 8 left there's something coming in the middle

Its changed at the bottom of the crystal theres
beautiful flowers & an animal like a lamb standing
upon them theres a foot on the animals head & a mist
above its forming into a spirit dressed in white, it looks
like gauze and a veil all over it there are beautiful
stones round the waist & neck and very beautiful & all
round the neck and arms, a veil covers all over down
to the ground behind & nearly in front, & her shoes look
like white satin shoes
Please to tell me your name
There's reading come in little leaves & rounds & all sorts of
shapes, I can see the lady is very dark under the
veil, I cannot understand the reading.
93
in the middle there is
3677   AA
          _____.
            I                       "The White Lady"

Have you any thing you wish to communicate
now there's a lot of those funny little letters come they are
so thick together and very black, her dress is full like ours
low neck & short sleeves, there's more things at the bottom
now
Are you the white lady who appears
Theres some more of those little letters come
I asked the spirit of the crystal to put them into English
3698  "Yes I am"
Why have you appeared uncalled
Theres some more of those strange words come she
is looking towards me, her lips do not appear to move
She is very dark & has very dark black eyes. there is
such a quantity of those words keep coming & going
She lifted her hand very high and there appeared
3679  "I will appear again

[symbol] 1 March 1853  8 pm  CA MIrror
Invoked the CA.
E.S. informs me that upon asking the CA who appears
in his crystal what were the letters upon the front of his
robe he replied
3680  "I have no letters."
c.a.  Then he is a spirit of Mars & cannot be depended
upon.
He also informed ES that Micano who he stated was
the highest spirit of the sun was my GS. how can I
best show ES their errors.
94
3681 You cannot satisfy him, all good spirits
must have letters on the stones that fasten 
their robes.
As I wish to confine this mirror to your appearance, who
shall I dedicate it to so as to prevent evil spirits therein
3682 A spirit cannot prevent the appearance of 
evil spirits sometimes.
Can you tell me a good spirit to dedicate it to 
3683 Shealdo is a good spirit, a female spirit
of the Sun but it would not hurt this mirror
to call any person in it either mortals or spirits
I had a young friend Alfred Oxley Proctor who died
about a year ago would it be convenient for him to appear
tonight
3684 he will appear when called on Tuesday 
evening next.
When letters and words appear in the crystal which we do
not understand by what form can I obtain their meaning
3685 the spirit of the crystal will translate them
for you if asked
Are the spirits or souls of Negroes & other races who are black
on this earth, also black in the spirit world.
3686 No, men are all equal & alike.
When the believers in Mahomet & other creeds not Christian
die do they in the spirit world retain their belief in
Mahomet.

The Black Mirror
Invoked Shealdo
The Black Mirror appeared exceedingly dark & as tho'
Emma could see for miles, but the ground & sky quite
black, after considerable delay a figure appeared which
for a considerable time Emma could not make out, at
last she said "it is a coat as tho a man was standing
sideways and I could only see a part of him, the
middle -- there is something red upon his coat -- this
remained so some minutes
What is your name
3691 Hermann Skerbroff
Why have you come uncalled
3692 I wish you to enquire who murdered me in
Germany in 1843
What is the name of the town or city nearest to the 
place where you were murdered
3693 You are Lord Pelham are you not or
am I mistaken
I told him my name & he gradually got smaller
so that the whole figure was perceiveable and Emma
Selina inspected but the mirror did not to her appear in the 
slightest degree cloudy.
90
& Emma saw that he was headless.
5' past 9
The C. A. Mirror
invoked Omoo
Omoo appeared in black velvet robe with dark brown
Curly hair, fair complexion, no whiskers, the eyes closed
but very large, indeed the size of life
Ex 3ce: What is your name
3694     Omoo
Are you the GS of Selina Elizabeth Leigh
3695      Yes

Will you appear when called in my ES Crystal

Emma said. he is here in black, blue handkerchief
dark blue studs light brown hair & dark blue eyes &
very slight whiskers
This figure again appeared as a Portrait or Picture
he looked pale but Emma could Even distinguish the
wrinkles round the eyes
9' 30  dismissed it.
10h. 20 PM         Japan Crystal
Called Mr. Anderson
he is here. Mr Anderson
3700 Sir
91
May I ask if you knew a Gentleman named Hermann
Skerbroff?
3701
What about him
he appeared this evening in my black mirror & asked
me to enquire who it was that murdered him in Germany
in 1843
3702
did you enquire
No I did not for he mistook me for you x & upon my telling
him his mistake he left & my Seer then saw with much
alarm that he was headless.
3703
Yes, but he could not have known my Name
Yet he did because he asked me if I was Lord Pelham
3704
What Pelham is that is he a friend of yours
Well I hope he is not an Enemy tho' sometimes he is very
annoying
3705
has he a Magic Mirror
and was very much frightened one night by looking into it
3706
indeed Lord Stanley
20 years ago when I was in Cheshire I used to be frequently
mistaken by the country wenches for one of the Stanleys
3707
I suppose so when Father & Son are together
they are generally taken for one of the Family
I begin to see through it all now, or begin
to think so, I wondered why you had so
many friends among the nobility, if you
was only what you described yourself to be 
we had some further chat on our mutual inability 
to convince each other who we were, or rather were not when
I said
Tell me about this Hermann Skerbroff
3708
Well to tell you the truth he haunts
98
the ruins of some old buildings in Derbyshire
I don't know what he should want with
Lord Pelham tho'
I have been told it was an old Abbey
but he said he was murdered in Germany.
3709   Well so he was but he still continues to haunt
that place he had some treasure deposited
there, he was a money grubbing old wretch.
do you know who murdered him
3710   No how should I - 
So I understand Miss saw her intended
this evening, she had better look out soon
& perhaps she will see him in reality.
do you know who & what he is
3711 Whatever he is now, & thats pretty respectible
his own hands worked the way to it.
The more to his honor.
3712 Oh certainly but we noblemen Lord Stanley
are more apt to look to the family & mean 
in the present station they hold, but Miss
is uncommonly amiable & I hope she
will soon have a good husband.
How do you get on with your Magic Mirror
Mr Hockley. I thought you intended using
it more frequently than the large one.
The spirit Augustine tells me that 
evil appearances cannot be avoided
Can't you oblige us with another narrative this evening
3713 Why you are as bad as any little niece, I
cannot poke my nose into the house but she
cries out, Uncle now tell us a story.
xx This was because I took off my neckerchief

[illustration]

The horoscope was covered with planets & figures & my face
appeared at the bottom corner -- it disappeared without
our being able to ascertain the name & date of the nativity.

Selina had first taken the crystal & upon its being thick
handed it to Emma who had very great difficulty
in reading the letters there were so small and I handed
her a magnifying glass which enabled her to see
much plainer!

99
3714 do you know how the Marchioness is, have
you seen Miss Green lately, Ive lost my 
dog. and cant find it.
Selina said what is the reward
3715 O 10/ to you Miss, but only 5/ to any body
else _ well as you are beginning xx to undress
I'll go good night
8' to 11 PM.

Theres a Clock come and the CA mirror underneath it 
the clock points to 1/2 past 8.
We will inspect the mirror on Tuesday Evening at
1/2 past 8. _ its clear
7 15 PM.  Emma took the Crystal from Selina & there

3716 The position of the Heavenly Orbs & of other
Heavenly bodies which constitutes the ever
varying life of mortals in the world below

Now its all Clear.  8 PM having lasted 3 1/4 of an hour.
10:25. Japan Crystal
3717 To see the White Lady
Low is no longer the Spirit of the Crystal
Who then is the Spirit of this Crystal
3718  The C.A. will inform you
at 10' to 11 Mr Anderson walked in
how are you this evening
100
3719 quite well thank you, how are you
Now old Gentleman Ill lend you my grandmrs.
stick which she was very fond of.
You did not tell if you knew Hermen S Kerbroff or not
3720 did I not, he must have mistaken it altogether
did you know him at all
3721 I have heard of him but I was not the person
he wanted
I am Sorry he appeared in my Bk Mirror
3722 I have reason to suppose that neither himself
nor any other of the kind will appear again
in it
Why so
3733 From an answer to a question I had from
Valvenius
do you call the Spirits of Heaven or Solar Spirits into yr.
Crystal
3724 Only the AA order I rather doubt the truth
of some of the rest.
I now began to call only the AA order myself
3725 I think that is best 
I asked a question of one of the Solar Spirits
the other day_
 She gave me an answer exactly contrary
to what did happen when I asked an AA
Spirit the Reason he told me they could not
be depended upon. for that reason I think
those spirits who appear in E.S's crystals
I give their names Hunder Low Tescho
are not good spirits, at least, they are not
what are termed bad Spirits
101
how can I convince E.S. of that.
3726 I should have thought you would have
enlightened the old gentlemans understanding
a little, I suppose he will come over here
soon.
have you had any novelties in your crystal lately
3727 Yes several, but I find it too small to read
well in it -- do you think a glass ball
will do as well
Yes Mr S. of the New Road made the one E.S. gave me
3728 Yes I know but I did not think they
answered as well as real ones.
Yes they do ES. gave me two excellent ones
3727 Thank you I am very glad of that
I am not fond of the mirror at all.
I use a silvered mirror 18 in x 12
3730 Are you perfectly sure of what will appr.
therein
In that one I can
3731 then of course its a pleasure but you did 
not call a mortal first did you
No I called the spirit of the mirror
3732 Well now Mr. Hockley we can test the
truth of one of them. Who appeared in my crystal the evening after you had used
yours and I asked him who was the
first that appeared in that mirror & he told
me a spirit who called himself the
C.A. and I asked him at the same time
if I appeared in your crystal now & annoyed
You & he told me "Mr Hockley was not
annoyed now at my appearing but had been
This proved to be precisely the fact as Mr. Leigh had whispered
it to Selina but neither me or Emma were aware of it
until thus mentioned
102
formerly, I assure you it was not my wish
to annoy you in any way.
Now? about Mr Burton do you think
he will succeed _ its very doubtful (Shaking
his head) altho I should have very much
have liked to have undertaken the same
expedition
I have given him my Small Crystal & am making
him a magic mirror
3733 They are a very ignorant race, I think any
thing would please them, but one of the 
Spirits informed me that if he took a boy
out who could see he would most likely
Succeed, that is in passing off for a professed
Conjuror, but that I remarked would be
impossible under the circumstances he is
going out
(to Selina) How do you think you'd like to go Miss
We then had some joking _ on which he noticed all we
did very readily & among other things he said _
3734 Your ma' wished you to rub your chilblains
Miss before you went to bed.
did you ever have the white Lady appear in yr. Crystal
3735 I have Seen her in reality I was driving
one very dark night in my dog cart, and
I saw the Lady all in white, She appeared
Very handsome her face towards me, So
plain that the horse started, that proves
that animals have the 2nd Sight as well as us
do you believe that animals exist hereafter
I do
3736 that they never are above the condition of
103
3736 Animals, there is something appears in
my crystal which comes as a marble stand
a pedestal and on the top is chained a
dove -with golden wings, I think it is a
spirit in that shape, and the answers it gives
I think is more correct than any other
it is a beautiful sight + looks the picture of
innocence.
 In seeing visions which the spirits
informed me were parts of Hades I have
seen this dove in the gardens have you any
idea what it is
No we have never seen it
3737 Why I think those ugly things appear in
the magic mirrors is because the antients
used them for discovering murders. the crystals
+ the vision + the mirror were only used for good
purposes that is seeing spirits, the old
magicians + astrologers used the mirrors for
discerning murders + Robberies
Have you had an antient Greek in your
crystal, to find out his name puzzles every
one that ever I knew- have you not noticed
the peculiarity of spirits using the same term
as you do for different things
I asked Mr A his opinion of Swedenborgs assertion as
to "familiar" or more properly Atmospheric Spirits _ which I
read to him
3738 Well I think it is the only way we can
account for their appearing but still all those
things are beyond our knowledge which only
extends to the things which occur in this
This was the exact time
104
world. have you heard about that
girl at Ipswich Mr Hockley lately-
strange thing - I went down + saw her
she appeared inanimate, I was very much
shocked at her appearance
I will call her some evening into the crystal
3739 There was a great outcry about her, but
I have not heard anything of her lately            
I am quite ignorant whether she is alive
or dead.
What's the time by your watch pray
hes taken it out + said
3740  20 minutes to 12 are you in a hurry
there is only one more question I wish to ask
Have you ever enquired when a person is
mesmerized if their spirit leaves the body              
or whether it is a wandering spirit that
enters them - I have been much troubled
about it lately, I mesmerized a servant girl
lately + she became clairvoyant + I very much
fear that was the case.
I gave my opinion thereon
3741  do you think there is a way of making
a person see in a crystal - I know there is
a way by black magic, but of course I should
not do that. We tried it once.
 Do all your dreams come true. I can
tell almost any thing that is about to
happen to me, so near that I can tell
when a letter is coming what post mark is
on it - but I will wish you good night
Good night-- hes gone

retains his memory of all his concerns in the world
is that the case
 3748     No it is not
He also says "that the inhabitants of every earth
After death become spirits + remain near the same earth
is that correct
 3749  No it is not
Swedenborg also says H & H  421 The world of spirits
is not Heaven, neither is it Hell but it is a middle place

3775   O yes for a couple of months together
have you had any novelties in your crystal lately
3776  I am very seldom able to look in it
  I've  seen the little Lady with the long             
 nose again she blew me up or rather blew
you up, she was very much annoyed at it
+ said she shd not fail to hint it to Mr
     Hockley that was on Friday night
112
I saw Sally in her usual sweet temper
If I show her any thing she says Oh its
very well for a housemaid.
I asked his opinion + read my letter to ES on the subject
of the diversity of names
3777   It may be so
It is the same with clairvoyants have you
not noticed it - it is exactly the same
with them if you ask two of them
have [Ely & Squirrell?] been in your crystal
3778 She is still living
Has Herman S Kerbroff appeared in your crystal yet
3779  Yes I cant tell what the fellow wants 
he wishes to try + claim acquaintance with
me very much - it was not me he asked                   
for in your crystal tho
  All I know of him is what he says of
himself + he mentioned the name of a
person I know, and I went and asked if
he knew such a person + he said he haunted
the ruins of some old place in Derbyshire
where some money was hid but he was
killed abroad
Cannot you tell the name of the place
3780  I will ask for you
but he said he was murdered in 1843 that's only 10 years ago
3781 1743 I think Sir
Have you been to the Sal le' Brun in 
Piccadilly amongst other amusements
theres some very clever tricks there, I have
often wondered at not seeing you there.
we then had a chat about Theater, Opera house
113
did you ever on looking at a small object in your crystal
use a magnifying glass. We did successfully
3782  Is it possible they become larger.
 I get on better now I have a larger glass            
I will try it (the magfr.) with my little
crystal - it is nearly 6 inches round, I see
yours is a great beauty, mine has a small
flaw in it
I do not know such a place as Sal le' Brun in 
Piccadilly
3783   "Brun" is only a nic name on account
    of a certain lady going there
After some other conversation he said he weighed
3784    13 stone 4
I weighed 14 stone 8 in my shirt sleeves a short time ago
he looked at his watch + said
3785    Its a 1/4 past 11
I said its half past
3786    I cant be a quarter slow can I or that
confounded rascal forgot to wind it up                  
last night, if I wasnt to do every thing
he would never do it - well I'll send Mr
Burton good night
25' to 12    Called Mr Burton
heres Mr Anderson come back
  3787   he cant come
why not
3788         because he's engaged
114
[symbol] Mar 22 1853       CA Mirror                    
1/4 to 7 PM          Invoked the C A
The mirror immediately became cloudy + Emma saw
after some delay Mr Burton appeared in dark Coat
+ dark Trousers standing obliquely from Emma so that
she saw most of his back
3789 You called for me on Sunday evening
        I am sorry I was engaged what did
      you want
did you not write me word that you would be with
me next Friday
  3790 Yes I did
I shall I regret to say, be engaged that day but any
other I will be at your service
3791  I had great hopes of seeing you before
  I left England
when do you think of leaving London
3792    Early in April
have you succeeded with the little Magic Crystal I gave you
3793  I cannot see in it myself neither can I
    find any one else that can, but I am in
        hopes of doing so
To whom shall I dedicate the Black Magic Mirror
I am making for you
3794  That of course you understand better than
  myself, I should think my GS the best
do you know Mr Anderson whom I asked on Sunday to
request you to appear
3795       No I do not
do you know now in the Spirit World what you are doing
at this moment in the body or where you are in the body [?]
115
3796  It is the spirit you see not the body 
do you mean the spirit that animates the body or the
spirit which is the "other self or counterpart
3797  The spirit that always remain in the
        Atmosphere
do you know my "other self" I mean the atmospheric
spirit which resembles myself
3798  Yes I do
Can you bring him into the mirror at the same time
that you are here
  3797  Not at the same time
Can you give me any information that will be of service
to Lieut Burton in the body
3800 I know nothing more than he knows
as our counterpart spirits know no more than we do
who are [clogged?] to this Earth
3801  The Guardian Spirit knows all things
      past present + to come but we do not
Now you are in the "spirit" do you know your GS +
will you tell me his name
3802  I know him
Will you tell me his name
3803 I do not know his name but I know
     him he has no name with us
how near are you to the Earth or are you upon it
the same as in the body
3804  Our world is in the atmosphere occasionally
  we visit the earth
   I will return
hes gone 1/4 past 7
116
20' past 7 Invoked the CA.
The CA is here ex.d
As to my Father
                    Do not go to him if you do you will
                    be involved in great trouble.
3805            his age renders it impossible for him to
                    remain much longer, but he will remain
                    a considerable time amongst you, I cannot
                    tell you how long for spirits have no idea
                    of time.
I invoked you on Tuesday last but Emma being unwell
She could not "See" I am sorry I gave you the trouble
to appear unnecessarily.
                   Knowing that she could not See, I did not
                   appear._
3806           It never troubles me.
                   Some part of my happiness consists in 
                   doing good- or in giving information
                   will do so- or prevent evil.
Will Emma be able to see in my ES crystal my young
friend Alfred Oxley Proctor who died about a year ago, I
am afraid to call him in this fearing it may alarm
her-
3807  The Laws that govern the spirit world
           render it impossible that his spirit can
          make itself small enough to enter a
          crystal at present.
His parents with a natural anxiety + especially his mother
wishes to know if he is happy.
3808    I will enquire but it is advisable not to
            force him into a crystal.
27 to 8 I will be back in 1/2 an hour.
117
The mirror became perfectly clear precisely as the
half hour was up. The mirror veiled & the CA appeared
       3809  "He is happy"
may I ask if he has any communication he would wish to
make to his mother
   3810   No he has not
has he seen any relation who died before him as his
Grandfather or Grandmother
  3811  Yes he has
his Father + mother are going to Australia - if they do so
will it be beneficial to them
  3812  Yes it will
hes gone 12' past 8 PM
8.20
Enquired of the CA if we could see the spirit of ELL my
Seer
3813 In sixteen minutes
24 to 9 Mists thick, theres one appeared in black
dressed trimmed round with white, its a side face & the
eyes are shut.
What is your name
3814 Emma Louisa Leigh
It is a long time dear Emma since appeared before
Will you answer me some questions
3815 Willingly
Can you tell me what we had better do for Emma's spine
& headache which trouble her so much.
3816 The one proceeds from the other, time 
alone will cure it
Can you appear in any dress you please
3817 I can but it is right I should appear
in black for dark indeed is the future
118
that awaits me in this world, may
it be brighter hereafter.
Do you know me in the Spirit World
3818 Yes I do
Do you know the gentleman who appears in our crystal
under the name of Mr Anderson.
3819 No I dont know him
That is not his right name, the name of
his Guardian Spirit is CAWL.
Shall I ever know him in the body
3820 He will not be known to you for some years
In what way do you amuse yourselves or pass
your time in the Spirit World
3821 Some wander about in gloomy discontent
and others in giving happiness to all around
them, when any great national trouble
is about to happen they all feel it as the
present
To what do you allude
3822 To the overthrow of Louis Napoleon
have you any foreknowledge when that will take place
3823 I have no idea of time
Will he make England
3824  I know not, but we feel that a great
calamity is pending that will throw
thousands in distress, husbands & wives
will be separated & children will become 
orphans. We feel it, we know it. 
But that will more immediately relate to people on
the Continent will it not.
3825 To France Austria Spain & England
119
Will Russia then escape
3826 No. No.
Which do you prefer to appearing in, this mirror or the ES
3827 It makes no difference I can appear in 
either
As to myself
3828 You would no well to seek another
situation
What &c
3829 I have not, this one is too much activity
for the mind & not enough for the body
When I ask the name of anyone's GS I am told a
different name from what ES receives in his crystal
how is that
3830 It simply depends on whether the spirit you
enquire of is of the same degree as the one
you enquire after. if it is the same you are
answered truly, but if higher or lower they
cannot tell correctly being out of their sphere
If the spirit of a person is of the CA order
You should ask a spirit of the CA order
his name.

I have recently changed my GS from Hunder a spirit
of the sun to the Crowned Angel & my crystal spirits
have also been changed, have I done right
3831 Yes I am afraid that Tescho the GS of
Earl Stanhope is an evil one.
how can I convince ES of that fact
3832 Most of the answers that ES receives in his
crystal are so very frivolous, that that
alone I should think would convince him
that his spirit is not of a high order I mean
Tescho
120
But ES has also the CA for the spirit of his crystal
3833 He's certainly not the CA who appears
in your crystal
There are a great many obstacles to overcome
& surmount in studying these mysterious 
sciences, and also a large amount of 
belief required, those obstacles E.S. will
not be able to surmount and I have no
doubt before he dies he will entirely abandon
them.
But his rank in society & learning & service give him
great advantages
3834 Yes but ES has not the amount of
knowledge about them that you have & 
his son is so very much against them.
I have been nearly 29 years a devoted searcher into
these occult subjects -- considering my limited means & a 
believer in alchemy as the transmutation of metals, do you
think there is truth in alchemy.
3835 I have been assured there is not, some have
been induced to practice it, for the sake of 
getting money & others -------
10 PM 
3836 I will come again in ten minutes
10.10 She is come back again & said
3837 Mr Burton seems dissatisfied at your not being
able to see him on Friday
I hope he will succeed in his undertaking
3838 he may succeed but it is very doubtful
Do you know your sister Selina in the spirit world
3839 Yes
121
how can we improve her power of Seeing
3840 I have been assured that if it is not a
natural gift it cannot by any means be
obtained.
As to the [?]
3841 I will enquire for you
When next Tuesday eg.
3842 Yes as any other evening before that which you
will name
Can you tell me how or by what law sonambulists in
the Magnetic Sleep see distant object & places.
3843 When a person is mesmerised & falls sound
asleep, the spirit is also unconscious
and wandering spirits who are always
travelling about unobserved by all, enter the
body and remain there & it depends upon
them whether the answers given by the
clairvoyant are correct or otherwise
Then I am afraid it may be prejudicial to the welfare
of their soul
3844 Yes that is the only evil belonging to 
mesmerism.
I find that all women who I mesmerise I have great
power over them & they become exstatic, which has proved
as source of great anxiety I know. -- how does that happen
3845 by the same law that the weak mind
always yields to the strong one.
May I ask you seriously if you & others in the spirit world
believe in the Divine Birth of J.C. as professed by the
Church.
3846 Some believe in that, and others partially retain
the belief they believed in on this Earth
122
When a person dies on this Earth, does the spirit
that animates the body and the spirit in the atmosphere
unite or do they Continue Separate
3847 The one passes with the other they have
in future one spiritual Existence
She is gone 26' past 10 PM
The mirror is still thick here is someone coming in a
dark dress, it's Sally but so cross.
Well dear Sally how do you do 
3848 I done say it matters a great deal about me
Why are you so cross in the spirit state when you are
so pleasant in the body
3849 You know as well as I do--you know I don't 
like her to appear, you might just as
well promise me now
--
because I want to enter both, but I am
not jealous so you have no occasion to
think it.
After some similar banter she left
1/4 to 11.

Called Mr Anderson
he is here
Did you ever call yourself or Georgina into your Crystal
3850 I did not know it was possible to do it
is it
Yes just as easy as Constraining anyone Else
3851 Well but they dont answer do they
do you yourself appear and answer satisfactorily
No but Emma does
3852 I was informed of that by Sally
I have informed that
Mr. A was dressed with a white waistcoat worked with gold
leaves round the pockets & end.--I remembered that
I had taken off my collar & neckf.

The crystal did not get at all clouded to Emma but to Selina it
appeared very much so
123
3853 I could have enlightened your
understanding upon that point
have you been to a ball in that fine waistcoat
3854 I saw you in Hyde Park last Sunday in
a claret colored carriage & bay horses with
two ladies with you
I have not been there this 20 years upon a Sunday. we 
then had a long chat & he left.

3855 
"In the F. H. Minor
The F. H. Minor
Now theres something coming it appears Misty its getting
longer, its a spirit - very fair hair, looks very youthful
& beautiful. Golden hair fastened in a band & hangs down 
the back, in white Robe & Wings.
Please to tell me yr. name 
3856 Octavus
Are you agreeable that this mirror should be dedicated to you
3857 Yes I am.
When I asked our visitor his name he replied
       You are Wm Glaybrook [?chener] are you not.
I S[?]  I am persuaded it was not Mr. Binton.
124
When F.R.B requests you to appear or allow
visions of mortals will you do so to those having the gift
3858 I will
Will you at his Request favor him with advice when in
Mental Anxiety & danger
3859 Yes
Can you give me any information that will be useful to
him -- Whilst waiting for this answer Octavus
gradually got Smaller & disappeared &
Emma said its thick here is some one coming, in a dark
dress, a mans dress, its Lieut Burton, now hes plainer
Shall we have the pleasure of Seeing you again before
you leave England.
3860 I am afraid not
Do you know in that state whether you will be able
to See or not in the mirror
3861 I shall not be able to See
Who is the lady, Louisa Colthurst you wished to see
3862 I am not aware that I requested to see
her.
Emma remarked he looks very surprized & I asked have
you mesmerised her lately -- & Emma said now he seems to
stare still more. Emma could only see the face
dark hair moustachios but the dress was covered by 
the mist.--hes gone
3863 Called R.F. Burton
he cannot appear tonight
Requested Octavus to allow Emma to have a vision that
would please instruct her
heres Mr Anderson with his fine waistcoat on, a white
satin ground & flowers & gold leaves & tendrils down the
wstcts front & collar
125
I am happy to see you, the ladies very much admire
your waistcoat
3864 It is too smart but I dont very often wear it
Who sent you into my mirror
3865 I thought it was Mr Burtons
If Mr Burton likes I will amuse the
little darkies sometimes
By what name shall he call you CAWL.
3866 Or Mr Anderson I think I have got abt.
20 names.
I had a dark looking foreigner in just now who took
me for Mr Dresser.
3867 Was he an officer in the army then for
no private gentn. wears mousts.
dont they really
3868 Private coxcombs & fops
Why you have got a little piece
3869 If I was to sell out I should cut them 
off tomorrow.
I suppose you would if there was to be an invasion
3870 then I had better see about it at once
for it would look rather suspicious to
sell out only a few days before.

3871 The first that always appears is that [lad?]
I told you about.
I wish you would ask it to appear in my crystal
3872 certainly I will
A man came in last night with light
hair & moustache, I don't know his name
I asked him what he wanted & he very
politely turned & walked off.
126
I suppose he was one of our counterparts
3873 Perhaps so I suppose I shall see you soon
as you promised at the Lyceum, but I am 
not going on a fools Errand
What is coming out at the Lyceum
3874 I will look in tomorrow & let you know
Why dont you go to the Haymarket theres
an extravaganza there.
The Ladies like the Lyceum because of the beautiful 
scenery, besides the Haymarkets so far off.
3875 Where you like, its all the same to me
I will tell you where theres a nice little
Theatre to see you at & the Ladies "The
National Standard'
That is too aristocratic -- heres dad come, will you come
in again at 1/2 past 10
3870 Yes I supposed you'l sport your diamonds

10 30 F. H. mirror (Mr Burton's)
He appeared [?] in black coat & trousers. the black 
mirror appeared quite white.
3877 Have you ever made one of those mirrors
that are made of white silk & open in 3 separate pieces
No tell me how they are made
3878 You get two pieces of mahogany, at least
you have them made like this -- & fastened
together like two thick covers of a book
a square thick piece of glass & exactly 
in the middle of this glass a small hole
is bored thro., about the size of a thimble
and on each side is white silk drawn
127
into the hole and fastened in the
middle and on the outside as well then
the glass is put in the middle of these two
pieces of mahogany + a little catch put on
to catch them all 3 together, I find them
better than the black mirror you would
be surprised the curious way in which they
appear
how then do you see if the two pieces are fastened together
3879 the top piece of mahogany is open
it catches like this one- the top piece is
opened and you see the white silk thro                 
the glass only there is a piece of white silk
on the top of the glass which makes
them look better
Will you show Emma one in this mirror
3880        I'll go and fetch one
he left + in about 5 minutes returned
3881  here it is just like this with two catches
it opens like a book the silk is seen round
the edge - lay it on the table + look                 
into it and I am told the scenery is an
inch to every mile yard the glass is
8 inches square
Is the silk that covers it "Persian"
 3882      Its silk gauze
What is the use of the hole in the middle
3883    I dont know the hole is larger than
a Thimble its near an inch in diameter
as possible the glass is nice thick plate
I'll get one made forthwith
3884   You will be surprized how beautiful the
They won because of him unkown
about [??]  [??] box  
128
Scenery is _ Scenes of India
When did you learn that Curious Method of Dimming
3886 CAWL told me the way to do it
did you ever call past events in the mirror
Mr Hockley - I mean great Events, the
battle of Waterloo-Trafalgar etc I saw the
battle of Waterloo in this & of course an
inch to a mile. I saw 8 miles round, I 
dont know how its done at all, those things
I will make one for myself & one for ES.
3887 Better have a deal one for ES.
dont you think. I give - as good as I keep myself -
3888 I dont mean that, only he'l think it
extravagance to have Mahogany
You must do the Middle Yourself
The Mahogany you can get made, I did
mine in 3 days My sister cut out the
silk velvet - Mary pasted it together
I hope you'l try it.
Are you present in this room with us
3889 I dont know how you mean when you
make this box I will give you all the
instructions as you go on with it, & lend
Miss an old pair of gloves to put on
If you aren't present how do you see those who are
in this Room & know what they say to each other
3890 In the body I am at the present time
inspecting my Crystal, just at the same 
time you see the formation of other
persons in yours - I must tell you that
on Saturday night I, when not out, I 
look in the Crystal longer than any other
129
3891 Nights I did so last night & a pretty
sight saw
Mr Anderson then detailed at full length the whole
of our various Actions in putting up a new Arabian
bedstead & most ludicrously correct—& from his dialogue
he appeared then to have become concerned that our
Situation in life was what I had always represented
to him—but which he had entirely disbelieved and he
Concluded by saying
3892   "If you are happy I envy you.
do you think we shall have war with France
3893   No Not with France
Do you think we shall have a war
3894 Yes—France & England against Austria
& Russia
Selina remarked "I wonder if he will go
3895
I don't want, but I cant help it, dont
you think it would look very bad selling
my Commission
Not so bad as Lord [W??ley] bolting off the field
3896
he ought to have been shot and would have
been. but for his influence, it does seem hard
for a young man to lose his life, especially
an only Son too—You would Soon miss me
then & soon find out how Good I was—
I don't exactly fear being killed, but I
dont like being Wounded, besides one is
never fit for much afterwards—after ones
been in battle, it breaks them up so, We
shall see our old friend among the Militia
I mean WH. but I suppose you are in a
hurry to go to bed.
130
No I am not
3897 If I was you my dear Miss (Selina) I never
would have him. he's a shocking temper, you
know how dear you are to me, I should not
like to see you throw yourself away, I have
often turned it over in my mind to propose
myself but such a rash act as marriage
requires a deal of Consideration

[symbol]  10.30 PM.    F.H. Mirror
            Called R F Burton
     No Vision
Called Mr Anderson
Immediately, he is here on a black horse
What is your horse's name
3898 Firefly between 7 + 8 years old, I've been out
for a ride, I am sorry I could not go to the 
Theatre—I told you I should go and see but
I have not been able—its 18' to 11 is it not
You are 4 minutes Slow
3899   Again
You keep very bad time
3900   half an hour ago it was exactly London Time
have you seen my Claret Carriage & my two Nieces lately
3901 I am afraid its all here now, I congratulated 
myself that I had found you out and began
fishing on Old Gentleman, + the old Gent.n
always smiled & looked so knowing & now
she laughs against me
—Ill take a glass of Wine with you I dont
like Grog.
All Country folks make a practice of sitting
131
down on Sunday Afternoons to drink Grog
After a great deal of idle talk I said
I cant think what is the use of the hole in the mirror
you told me of.
3902
Why dont you try it without the hole then
I think it would be quite as well—
this is my New Crystal then what do you
think of it
What is the name of the Spirit it is dedicated to
3903 CAWL
Good bye-good bye Miss
he's ridden off—now theres his Groom on a dark horse
a very dark one. & a cockade in his hat

[symbol] March 29th, 1853  C A Mirror
1/4 past 7.   Invoked the C.A
The C A appeared in White as usual—the Mirror was
veiled when Emma Sat down & she immediately said
there is a good deal of writing
3904
The Gentleman that calls himself Mr Anderson
mistook C A W L in his directions for
making the white Mirror , no hole should
be made thro the glass, the Silk on the
underside of the glass should be made
tight and the silk at the top very loose
so that it may be caught up at the top
with a piece of wood over it, he did not
intend to Mislead you for he made his own
like it
Then I suppose the hole is to look thro' like looking into
a box
3905   Yes
Mr D. appeared the size of life to the head & shoulders & extraordinarily[?]
plain every mark & pimple even appeared he looked towards
me & his appearance of cold & astonis[h]ment when spoken
to completely convulsed Emma, the spectacles appeared 
to magnify the eye.
Will you please to show Emma how it should be made 132
3906 I will and I will return in ten minutes 
30' past 7
Now the C A 's come back & something square has 
formed at the bottom it looks like an accordion
how large should it be
3907 Eight inches square & 2/3" thick with
the case when Crown up straight. the 
sides leather.
Is that better than a black mirror
3908 Yes, it is much better for scenery than
seeing spirits - such as Foreign
places a great many people together
May I dedicate it to you-
3909 Yes
the C A's gone 10' to 8.
Called E.S.S

spectacles on in black coat & waistct & very dark Half
Will you please to tell me your name
 3910 No answer

Will you ask ESS to appear
3914, he nods his head
he's gone
1/4 past 8.
**omitted could not" approach near enough the home is
made by the strength of their will, but most of those places
where the rappings are heard for money, are cases of
importance.
133
Called ELL.
here is some one in black
What's your name
3915 Emma Louisa Leigh
Why do you appear in that gloomy dress
3916 I like this best. Do you wish me to wear
any other. Mr Burton is waiting to 
appear.
?
3917 Your spirit goes wherever your thoughts 
dwell and what is the cause of persons
appearing after death.
Can we commit sin in the spirit state-- is can
My atmospheric spirit commit any sin.
3918 No
There is now much excitement caused by spirit rappings
as it is termed in which noises are made by spirits
who represent themselves as the deceased friends or
relatives of the parties present. are they as they
represent themselves.
3919 In some cases if a party very urgently
wished to see their father or mother or
any deceased relative, their atmospheric 
spirit would join the spirits of their decd
relative & thereby make themselves heard 
if not seen
By what means do they make these noises audible
3920 The noises are made by the atmospheric spirit 
not by the spirit of the decd relative that 
could not. ^xx Spirits have as much dread of 
human beings as human persons have
of spirits and that is why one shows                             134
the other, but should they be very much
wished to make themselves known they
would much rather rap than be seen.
When a circle of persons sit round a table with
their hands upon it - + it moves about can you tell me
by what means or by what [?] it does do
  The table must be made of pine wood
and 6 persons or at least 5 by placing
their hands downwards upon the table
it gets after they have been sitting in                3921
that position for ten minutes so thorly
charged with the magnetic blind the
same as a clairvoyant not in the Mesmeric
ship it ascends of its own accord the
persons keeping their hands upon it
many are imposed upon by that means
it is not probable that spirits would appear
merely for the purpose of upsetting chairs
+ tables and alarming people to say nothing 
of occasionally bruising them
   Shall I depart now as Mr Burton
is waiting to appear
have you any urgent reason for wishing to leave so soon
 Not at all I would stay longer but Mr
Burton says he was called first the                    3922
other evening
18' to 9
1/4 to 9          Called Mr Burton
Mr Burton is here only the head + shoulders + so large
he looks so cross
Good Evening Sir
133
3923
good evening, I should have taken it rather
more polite if you had called me first this
Evening, after having called me the other
evening when I could not appear—
If the Spirits do not appear in my
Crystal and answer my questions I shall be
very cross with them, will that do them
any good.
I told him I had made the Mirror &c
3924
I am very much obliged to you for what
you have done and I think you can do
nothing more.

Cannot get one made correct.
I'll make you one when I make my own

of Seven Oaks, I don't know who he went to
visits -- when he came back I asked him
how our friend the MC was -- (you often
joking about her) but he was quite ignorant 
what I meant, I was so vexed the next

scamp knew all about it, and got the 
laugh of me -- do you eat suppers, I

To see Mr WG Dresser
here he is with his spectacles on, only his head shoulders

3964 They said I should prove a troublesome
customer & so I will"
After using very strong efforts Mr D. left 35' past 8
1/2 past 10 PM Called Mr Anderson

1/4 to 8 PM. The CA Mirror
Invoked the C.A. & with a little delay there came
"He will appear at 8 oclock"
8PM. The CA appeared very large but very indistinct as
tho seen thro a mist
Can my seer see Mr Prigge's sitting room in Bernard Street
3971 In the crystal you can
In my ES or the Japan.
3972 In the Japan one
Can I see the At[mospheric] spirit of my seer ELL in this mirror

We then discontinued

[symbol] 7th April 8h30 AM Japan Crystal
Called Mr Anderson who appeared and I told him we
were going to the Lyceum that evening
3975 Oh then I will be there but I should advise
you to go to the Haymarket you will be
much more amused.

[symbol] 8th April 1853
20' to 7 PM Called Mr Anderson who immdly appeared
Why were you not at the Theatre
3976 You were [?], for I saw you tho' you
did not see me. I can tell you one thing
You sat munching oranges half the time.
I think you had better next time go into
the Gallery., you can then throw the peel
on the peoples heads, I expected to see
some sandwiches and a bottle come out.
Selina says she saw you tho'
3977 Then Miss tells fibs, for I am very sure
she could not see me, unless Miss could
see through the curtains, if she saw any
one she saw Mr. --- I staid an hour & a 
half, my friend went in first & then I went
in I saw the dancing--
I saw you Miss. (to Selina)
144
What colored bonnets had they
 3978  Miss had one on between a blue + a purple
+ what had the Lady on the other side of me
 3979  The very short lady beside you had a red one
Why that was my little Seer Emma
 3980  Little good gracious
Brownlows 48 pounder was a Shrimp to
her. well I expected to see an old Gentlem.n
come in with a smock frock + crook + was
rather surprized to see such a small Gentleman
 Last Saturday night I was at the Station
I never saw a better company there before
What time was the Queens little son born
 3981  I do not know time
I dont think we shall have a War now 
I am so glad I didnt sell out.
I know now what I wanted to tell you
   Last Tuesday Evening you could not see
much could you I think I can tell you
why
      About 1/2 past 10 a spirit came into my
crystal + told me that you had not had any
visions at least very indistinct ones and the
reason of it was that the persons who were
present did not believe in it + therefore the
spirits that appeared would not answer
questions, of course we ourselves when in that
state do not like to be joked about
 I was told that they thought you
very much deceived or laboring under some
sad delusion and that is the reason I use
145
my crystal when those only are present
who believe in it and I believe Lord Stanhope
does the same
Will you come in again we are obliged to leave off
3982    Yes but in earnest I was at the Theatre
    last night and I saw all of you
I told him about the curtains in one of the boxes being closed
3983 We had that and had a double advantage
as we could see the dancing I also
see you + see the actresses before they came
on.  good night
[symbol] 12 April 1853 The C A Mirror
Invoked the C A
He is here as usual
May I ask you some questions this evening
  3984  Yes
Will you please to inform me why Emma saw so
imperfectly on Tuesday evening when Mr. Prigge & Mr
[Robman?] were here
3985 because they disbelieved it, at the same 
time spirits do not like to appear when
they are ridiculed
Is the spirit world divided into spheres & circles
3986 Some of the planets are
Has this earth different spheres of spiritual inhabitants
around it
3987 Yes
how many spheres are there around this Earth
3988 Seven.
the CA is leaving
146
Will you please to send my seers atmospheric
spirit into the mirror
3990 I will in 15 minutes
25' to 8.
Here she is in the same dress black with broad white bands
down the front and all round the sleeves very deep sleeves
Are you the ASpt of my seer ELL
3991 Yes
When I called you last Tuesday evg Emma could see
you but imperfectly, can you tell me the reason
3992 I was persuaded not to appear because
there was someone present who did not
believe in the appearing of spirits
How then am I to convince my friends of the truth of
these apparitions
3993 They never will believe in it, they did not
conceal their merriment, much as they tried
By what means do spirits appear to us as you do now
3994 I do not move from the spirit world but 
thro this glass you can see the invisible
world, it is the means of communication
between the one & the other.
I am going to make a fresh mirror shall I put
a black back, or some other color or silver it.
3995 I do not think darkness at all
admirable, or any thing relating to it
because evil spirits always clothe
themselves in darkness & prefer appr.
in any thing dark than light
Shall I silver it like this
3996 Yes I think that to be much the best.
147 Have you in the spirit world visible objects
as Hills Trees
     3997   Oh yes every thing that is desirable
                  in that respect it is different from 
                  Hades.
Have you visible objects such as palaces, homes,
buildings
   3998 No there is no art, all is nature
How many spheres are there
   3999   7 Round this Earth 
               8 Round Jupiter
               6 Round Mars
How many circles are there round the [Sun symbol]
     4000 They are all one order of Spirits that
              inhabit the Sun & belong round it
May I ask which Sphere you dwell in
        4001  the Second AA
                                       I
              I do not know
            Mr Dresser is waiting to appear he will not
            let me stay.-
           Very few are alike in body & Spirit
         Mr Dresser is here do you want him to appr.
           Shall I leave for him to come
No I do not want., Pray ask him to leave
  4002      he is gone but he will enter the ES crystal
          and I am afraid influence others to appear
         to be quite sure of seeing mortals as they
         really are, you should see them in this
         mirror their faces then would be exactly
        the Same.
148
do you know my Atmospheric Spirit in the spirit world 
4003        I know him but we so seldom see each
                 other.  our callings are so different
May I ask what you mean by the world Callings
4004          We both I trust go on errands of
                  Mercy - but very different ways so that
                  we very seldom meet.
Will you ask my At Spirit to appear in this mirror
either tonight or any other Tuesday
 4005            I will
In the Spirit World, in which you now are, are you
all equal or are their difft. grades.
4006 Rank is nothing, we are all equal, & that
is how many mistakes are made in using 
the crystal, by the spirits I mean, 
a spirit will call himself Mr when he is in 
reality a Lord. I will tell others so, the same
as Mr Anderson, I don't know his rank.
Mr Anderson has ceased to annoy us, indeed he now 
interests us very much.
4007 He called me into his crystal on Saturday
evening and said to me, I know you appear
in the mirror of some gentleman, I dont
know his name. Wil you ask him if I 
annoy him or not. he has told me I used to
do so, and I should very much regret it.
In the body Mr A is one of the most 
gentlemanly, unassuming men that ever
lived and one of the kindest.
He does not annoy me now -- we are always glad to see him
4008 I will tell him he will be pleased to hear it
149
If Mr Dresser procures a seer I think
it will then be different because when a 
spirit appears in his crystal he can tell
them he does not wish to annoy you --
When you told Mr Anderson he tried
every means to stop it, but for some time
without success.
May I request how long you can stay at the time in the mirror
4009 I can stay any length of time when I am not otherwise engaged.
A few days since I mesmerised an elderly gentleman
for pains in his hip [?] & leg --
4010 Mesmerism will not do him any good.
Can you tell me any other process
4011 As medical advice had failed I do not
think you can do him any other good.
his age renders it improbable he will 
ever               it entirely
Your sister Selina is now very poorly with a sore throat
If I mesmerise her will it do her any good
4012 Yes that would her good it is only a 
swelling of the glands.
How many passes shall I make
4013 You can do so if you please until she feels 
relieved -- 20 or 30 is I believe about the
number, however it will not do her any 
harm at all.
Mr Dresser is very violent now in his
endeavors to enter the ES crystal
I have not heard lately from ES. Can you tell me 
the reason
150
4014 I will enquire 
when will you let me know
4015 if I return in half an hour will that suit you
Yes and I will let Mr Dresser into the ES in the mean 
time -- shes gone.
1/4 to 9 PM ES Crystal
40 Called Mr Dresser
He is here with his spectacles on.
I asked him a great many questions but could not get
any answer at last he said
4016 I said I would and so I will
May I ask why you wish to annoy me
4017 You may ask, but I shall not answer it
I expostulated with him but he only laughed & nodded,
4018 I shall appear if I like
I then ex.d & after some difficulty he got gradually less
then turned round nodded his head & giggled & left -- 

1/4 past 9 CA Mirror  Call ELL
have you learnt why I have not heard from ES
4019 I could not find out, for I had not long
left this mirror before I was called into
Mr Andersons crystal to inform him what
you had said.
In the seven spheres which surround

4020 those of the AA order
but which sphere are they in
4021 The first one
Can you show me &c

When will Emma See my [Ol] Spirit
4023 Next Tuesday he has promised to appear
would you like to see Mr Anderson on as he
really exists at this moment.
Yes. much
4024 he will appear when I leave, he has promised
to do so.
Do you know your [?] Spirit
4025 Yes Constentine
do you know my PS
4026 Yes the C A. he is high. very high
What is the name of Selma's PS
4027 OMOO
of what order of Spirits is he
4028 I do not know
I have this evening received this letter from my late
Wifes Sister to inform me, she has an offer of marriage
had she better accept it is it [?]
4029 In your crystal You Saw the wedding
& you also saw the Consequences.
[?] what we [?]
4030 There were many things in that cloud if
You refer to your notes
It will not be a happy one.
It was so ordered that it should take place
let us trust that it is better, than if it had
not done so.
do you still think we shall have a continental Warfare
4031 It may not happen in a very short time,
But the time is not far distant when it will
happen_in [?] of Warfare the Spirit
World is much agitated
Is the spirit form such as you now appear in the
covering of our soul when we leave this world by death.
4032 Yes If persons leave this world with the
least hatred or ill feeling to any one to any one in
the world, it is a great obstacle to their
happiness hereafter, they should
perfectly free from any thoughts about
the persons they leave.
But the earnest prayer & thoughts of those left behind
on this earth about the departed, do not injure the
deceased I promise -- that is inconvenience them.
4033 Oh no not in the least I did not mean 
that
Shes left.
10 PM To see Mr Anderson.
Now he is here so very large. in black trousers, black
patent boot black dress coat one white kid glove on & 
one in his hand. a green stone finger ring with a coat
of arms on it, white cravat, white large cane, & cord
white flower in his coat -- 3 flowers green leaves, & the
lace paper -- he looks much younger -- black bushy
hair not so much whiskers as in the crystal, rather
stern look -his eyebrows black & nearly meet, no
beard -- his teeth long & very white. his upper lip turned
up rather. & such intensely black eyes.
Good evg Sir We are happy to see you
4034 (he bowed)
When were you at the Lyceum last
4035 I was at the Lyceum on Thursday night
Selina here said I hope you are satisfied
4036 I am perfectly satisfied, I had a good
153
view of you and the Ladies at the same
time & I can tell you. You are the same
person I saw at the station at London 
Bridge.
At some future time I hope to have the pleasure of
personally seeing you & showing you these notes
4037 I shall have great pleasure in showing 
you mine, if indeed we ever do  meet
Do you find any real service in your power of seeing
in mirrors
4038 I am certainly greatly enlightened as to
spiritual matters
4039 It was remarkably so
4040 At the same time I was ill, I appeared in
your crystal on the Tuesday and on the 
following Thursday was taken seriously ill
I went abroad for a short time, and since
then I have been on the coast in Devonshire
& latterly in London.
It had more interest to me from the circumstance, that
Hunder informed me the spirit Low was with you at the
times and that you were labouring under delirium tremens.
4041 Yes, If I were to tell my friends of that
circumstance in Italy, they would tell me
I was out of my mind that is the reason I 
am so very particular in not disclosing my
name.
I very much wish I could get ES. & my At. spirits to
appear in each others crystals as readily as we appear 
to do - do you know why we cannot
154
4042 I cannot imagine but I believe he has 
the same difficulty in obtaining answers
from you
It is strange very strange, and every
thing connected with it is strange, but it
ceases to be a wonder.
he has taken out his watch
What time is it
4043 I'm 20' past 10
You are within a minute of railway time
4044 Yes the other evening I was right I think
Yes I afterwards found I was wrong
4045 I will wish you good evening
Good evening Miss (to Selina)
The watch appd. so plain that Emma could discern the
chasing & the sewing of his gloves.

10h.25' PM. Called RF Burton. CA Mirror
4046 He will appear on Tuesday evening.

[symbol] 19 April 1853
1/4 past 7. The CA mirror
Called ELL.
I am here dressed in black as before
Why do you appear in that dismal dress
4047 It will appear to you that I am
dressed in some other color if you wish it
do you appear in that black dress of your own choice
Emma never wears a black dress in the body
4048 Yes I do
ES writes me that the spirit rappers tell him he will become
an excellent writing medium, Can you tell me how I 

153
I can acquire that faculty
4049
he will not attain it, none can do so, it is
a Gift
Can they even hope to attain it as a Gift, if not born with it
4050   No they Cannot
ES and Dr Ashbonner are coming on Sunday, will you
then appear to answer my questions
4051   Sally dont like me to appear
Will my Atmospheric Spirit appear if I call him
4052   Yes
do you know Lieut Burton in the Spirit world
4053
I have seen him the Ship is safely
on its way to the Holy Land.
Do you know the name of the Ship
4054   No I do not
Will you enquire for me against the next time you
Appear.
4055
he will not tell me himself, I do not
know who to enquire of
In the spirit form I cannot see
what is passing on Earth, any more
than you can see what is passing (here.?)
The same things are always passing
in the atmosphere, as is passing on the
Earth, but one spirit cannot tell what
Another is doing unless he enquires.
do I then appear to pass my time, part of the day
Writing at a desk
4056
To another Spirit you would appear
to do so
But the other ES when Mr Dresser appeared in the Crystal
156
laughing & giggling at us he was at that moment
in a very sober mood & any thing but mirthful in the body
4057 When the Atmospheric Spirit leave the 
Ate. to appear in crystals or mirrors, it is then
master of its own actions and can act as it
pleases, at the same time the form is
complete in the spirit world, the same as
when the spirit which animates the body leaves
it when asleep.
Is it possible for the spirit which animates the body
to leave it
4058 Yes it does leave it & another spirit animates
the body of the clairvoyant & that is why
evil spirits so often enters
I remarked to her the discrepancy that she had formerly
said "the spirit remained quiescent in the body.
4059 The spirit is perfectly invisible & remains
in the body and another spirit for the 
time animates it.
When I am mesmerising a man & wish to send him
asleep can you tell me how I can do so readily
4060 You cannot be certain of sending them to 
sleep that only depends upon your 
power over them.
You yourself will answer the other questions
in thirty minutes.
Hes gone
8h15 PM. Called my, FH, Atmospheric Spirit
You are here dressed as at present
have you ever seen your mother in the spirit state
4061 Yes
Can you tell me---
4062 No
157
Is she happy
4063 I do not know 
Can you tell me in what manner you pass your time or
state of existence in the spirit world 
4064 I could tell you if I liked 
and why not
4065 I have good reason for not liking. 
As you like investigating magic, Alchemy, & Astrology in 
The Spirit World
4066 If I meant to tell you what I liked or did 
not like, I should have told you when 
I first appeared.
I cannot conceive why you refuse to give me information 
as I seek only to extend my knowledge on those subjects 
4067 Oh. (making a "face.")
I am always ready to give any one information upon 
any subject so far as my knowledge extends & I should 
have thought you would be the first to assist me 
4968 Indeed (making anr. grimace )
do you know the Atc. Spirit of Mr Dresser
4069 Yes he's a friend of mine
& to judge from his actions not much wiser
4070 how very curious
I formulated to make him give me a sensible answer & 
he left abruptly
40  Called W G Dresser
Here is yourself come back with some other gentleman
with black hair, side faced.
Who is your friend
4071 You asked for Mr Dresser & I've brought him
Question by Mr Dresser -- Why have you so annoyed Mr Hockley
158
4072 Mr D He called me and I appeared, I could
not do more.
Could you not have answered his questions courteously
4073 I could if it been agreeable
but you came when you were not called why did you do
that.
4074 I had been called before when I could
not appear & that was the first time I 
could appear.
do you know any thing about my son Mr Dresser
4075 No
do you know if he is alive or not
4076 FH No he does not
In the spirit world do you ever meet with the spirit
of Harriet Atkinson who formerly married my cousin
4077 No I do not
do you know where she is now
4078 (they both shook their heads)
will you fetch her into the mirror
4079 The are both shaking their heads
Will you promise not to annoy Mr Hockley & when you
appear to act properly
4080 FH he is my particular friend
Can I see you in the mirror if I look in
4081 You had better try
Mr Dresser took Emmas place & as he looked in, they
went out one on each side of the mirror, when Emma
retook her place they both appeared & upon my asking
why they acted so foolishly they both put their
thumb to their nose ([?] "took a sight") at her two
& then left together.
159
Called Lieut Burton
Here is You & Mr Dresser & Mr Lea of London
4082   FH. another of my particular friends
Now you have gone further off theres an Elderly Gentleman
quite bald Come in, its ES.
When Shall I have the honor of Seeing you at Croyden
4083   ES. Any Sunday you will write & say is correct.
ES's gone
May I ask you Mr Lea how you pass your time in
the Spirit World
4084   Very pleasantly
Then you dont "Grind your nose" at the Desk
4085   I am not obliged to answer you am I.
Good manners would Compel you to do so
4086 Yes but you know we are such good
friends we dont stand for good manners
Now they have all put their fingers to their noses & left

Called Lt Burton
9.'8'PM.   No Vision
Called Mr Anderson
he is here.
4087
I am very glad you have called me in
on Saturday Evening after looking for about
half an hour , a likeness came into my
Crystal, it was beautifully painted a Lady
about 25 Years of Age but I have not the
slightest recollection of her having Seen her, I
enquired her name—if it was a fancy
Portrait—,or if the beautiful original was
living but could not obtain an answer
160
I then enquired who was the artist, because
if he lived either in England or abroad I could
have found out his name.
I wished to know if you know it, it
stayed there 3/4 of an hour -- look here he's
(holding it towards you its Cardboard, its very
Small with a cap on, light hair + a dark
blue dress, hardly any eyebrows but appears
to have small black eyes.)
Were her Eyes blue or black
4088 they looked to me rather greenish but do
you know such a person.
I told him about myself & Mr Dresser + asked him how
his Atc. Spirit behaved to him when Called
4089   the greatest fool imaginable
how do I behave to him you call me
4090 Your behaviour now is not at all frivolous
tho' rather the reverse of polite, it very
much annoys me that I cant prevent
my appearing
And you Call my Seer Emma with your Crystal
4091   A Lady in black that always appears
In black trimmed with white
4092   Yes.
did you not ask.
4093 Yes but the name Appeared So Small
I could not read it I miss many
answers so
Your Crystal is too small You should get a larger one.
4094 I intend having one I do not like
using the mirror at all
161
I have been endeavoring to find out how our Atc. Spirits
pass their time in the Spirit world
4095
That we have a double there is no Doubt
but how they pass their time is to me
perfectly inconceivable
I cannot bring myself to Conceive that you were really
Present in the theatre the other evening
4096
I saw you bodily I sat in the stage box
on the left hand side
Can you send addressed to me at Croyden—say an
empty Envelope—in any persons handwriting—it
would not cost a £ & yet be a great satisfaction to
me. You could arrange it so that there could be
No clue to the sender.
4097
Even to that there is great objections
the time will not be long before I shall
be able to see you and tell you all
I am 23 now by the time I am 30 we
shall be acquainted.
I hope I behave better in Your Crystal than I have
done this Evening
4098
Your conduct has certainly not been Gentlemanly
but as my own is the same, it is no judge
of the body.
Can I see you If I look in
4099
I do not know but I will Remain while you
try.
Mr Dresser inspected but could only see as in other mirrors
I am obliged
I find Emmas A Spirit the best informed of any I call
4100   Yes I know that she has told me things
162
which I am sure will happen I wish you
could develope your faculty, it would be
a great addition to our Studies
Emma Remarked he has a womans Apron on his arm &
I asked whose it was
4101
I dont know whose it is, but I thought
it very untidy lying on the stairs
Are you a [perma?]

Have you any thing to communicate to me.

20' to 10 PM PM Called ELL

Earl Stanhope is coming on Sunday will you then
appear at my request
You will not be able to see visions
except on Tuesday evenings for a long
time but I will appear to Sally

Yes but I am afraid his manners are
not improved by an acquaintance with
you.
Can you tell me why our atmospheric spirits
act so differently from what we do in the body
166
In the Atmosphere you are Exactly the Same
As in the body , but when it appears in the
Crystal it is no longer Master of its own
Actions it is under the Control of the Spirit
that governs that --------
Mr WG Dresser insists upon appearing now
And will not cease to annoy me saying as his

Good evening Sir I am happy to see you

I think it's on so ridiculous a subject
I dont think the appearance of two
men however much superior need cause
you such merriment
Have you used your box mirror
I have used it and it answers perfectly
well, do you talk very loud that the
answers appear so large
Is Sally coming on Sunday, I can see

The CA appeared having light hair—[?] 3 times.
Are you the same Spirit who appears on Fred Stockley's
Crystal.
4126   Yes
do you return the same answers in both Crystals
4127
No not always.
Why do you not do so
4128
because I have different opinions
Will you Appear in this Crystal to Emma on Tuesday
4129
Yes.
Emma inspected the Crystal & immediately said here is a
Spirit but it is not the same. this has dark hair
Are you the same spirit who appears in F.H's Crystal
4130
No
I had changed the Black Mirror and ES invoked the 
CA. which became clouded but before any vision appeared
I dismissed it & charged the C.A mirror as opposite

F.H.  Are you my GS.
               Yes
        do you know the spirit called Tescho
               Yes
        do you know the spirit Sirius
               Yes but he is a very bad spirit.
        Emma inspected but could not see
168
What is your name?
4131 Monto.
he's gone.

As ES charged both crystals at the same time we got into
confusion and I at his Ldps. request - charged my CA Mirror
Miss Cook being speculatrix
Invoked the CA
The CA appeared in white, light hair a crown on his head
Will you appear to ES in his crystal
3142 Yes
Are you the same spirit who has hitherto appeared in his
crystal
4133 I am
Will you appear to Emma in this crystal at my request
4134 I will if I am not engaged.
Should ES use the same exorcism which I use.
4135 Yes
And the same Call
4136 Yes
The CA's gone

After some little time had intervened ES keeping the 
conversation up with Dr. Ashbonner I charged my
ES crystal Miss Cook Spex.
Called Mr Anderson
Miss C said here is a gentleman in brown coat & black trousers
Why have you come when I called Mr Anderson
4137 Mr Anderson has sent me
Why did he not come himself
4138 because he does not like to appear to Sally.
Hes gone
169
E.S. in my E.S. Crystal Invoked the C.A. - Sally seer
He is here in a blue & white Crown & blue & white dress.
Are you the C.A. who appears in E.S.'s crystal
4139 Yes
Emma then look the crystal but the spirit vanished instantly

E.S. recalled Monto
No vision

E.S. invoked Tescho - his Lordships GS.,
He is here in Armor as usual.
I exorcised him (strongly) He disappeared thro' the bottom of
the crystal (Miss Cook seer)

E.S. recalled him & he again appeared
I exorcised him & he disappeared as before

E.S. recalled him & he again appeared
E.S. said if you are the spirit Tescho appear, if not depart
Tescho remained in the crystal - E.S. then used my form
of exorcism & to his surprise Tescho immediately disappeared

E.S. then called a number of spirits for Emma to see but
only 2 or 3 appeared - Emma's vision having left her

Dr. Ashburner took up my Japan crystal, & then said
there's a very thick cloud - now there's 2 windows & a pier
between them out of the pier comes a very strong light wch
vanishes and then returns - now the pier is cloudy, the
pier which was quite black is now quite white - His Ldp.
here entering into communication   Dr A. left off inspecting

(Dr A. was not previously aware that he possessed the faculty of
crystal seeing)
170
Dr. A. being a medium being informed of a spiritual
presence by a touch on his ear, - he generally being in rapport 
receiving instructions from his deceased father . at ES.! 
Request asked if he ES. would be able to develop the faculty 
of being a medium and the Dr. sitting passively with a pencil 
in his hand the spirit of his father moved his hand 
he wrote.

  4140  "(?) me not worthy to obtain a reply 
such questions."
His (?) Dr A related many instances of spiritual manifest(?) 
which they had experienced in spirit rapping, visiting (?) and table moving (?)
 ES. informed me. The mechanics of  stashing (?) used the 
crystal also Lady Zetland.  [?] promised me  [?]

171
Mirror if I call him
4145 Yes
the CA's gone

The Green Crystal
Invoked Hoto 3 times
20' to 9 PM. No vision

The C.A. Mirror called ELL
The mirror became densely clouded & then a very white
opaque cloud like a piece of white paper, gradually a head
formed at the top of the Cloud, Which loosely resembled
a human form: the lower part of the face of a very bluish
cast & underneath these appeared
4146 "Dr Ashburners Father"
Your Son Dr Jno Ashburner believes that he has become a
writing Medium thro' your guiding his hand and
that on Sunday he here wrote this answer to Lord Stanhopes
Query by your guidance - is that so, did you guide his
hand.
4147 (he shakes his head)
if that was not done by your means by whom was it done
4148 (here there came out a hand pointing [drawing] so
do you mean that these spirit rappings & manifestations are
caused by evil spirits and these immediately came under 
him
4149 He cannot speak but his answers shall be
given when he has disappeared.
I dismissed him 10' to 9 PM & the Mirror cleared
I asked for the answers & the crystal clouding these
immediately appeared.
172
He has not guided his sons hand, he was not
aware his hand had been guided, but if it
had been guided he thought at the same
time it had been guided by some evil spirit,

9 PM.
Called ELL my Seeress.
Here somebody come dressed in white
What is your name

4150 Emma Louisa Leigh.
Why cannot I as Mr Lea obtain Hoto's appearence in this
Crystal which I gave to him

4151     Hoto has deserted it and a bad spirit has
taken possession of it, he has not been called
frequently Enough.

I can I suppose dismiss that Evil Spirit & dedicate it to 
a good one.

4152     Yes but that one too will desert it unless
he is called twice a week.
Spirits have a great dislike to any thing Green

The Crystal itself has unfortunately a very green Cast.

4153     That is why they will not keep themselves
to it - you do not have the same trouble
with either of yours.

Can you tell me how the Tables are moved when the
Medium asked it to be done, can you move one of my
Crystals for me

4154     No I could not, when the tables are moved 
it is by Evil Spirits, in very few cases those
raps are made by good spirits, they would
not rap merely for a person to get money by it

Is there any way of breaking that Chain by which a
173
woman like Mrs Haydon has become a medium
4155 She could break it herself by exorcising them.
Could I do it unknown to her by holding her hand
4156 No you could not. she should do it herself & 
earnestly too She would not think
of asking them to rap unless you gave
them a sovereign first.
Dr. A believes & that sincerely that he is a writing medium
by means of his Father & that his deceased Father last
Sunday guided his hand to write this answer, what is
your opinion of it.
4157 That his deceased Father is in the too high a 
state of bliss ever to come in contact with a
living mortal -- if his hand is guided by a 
spirit it is his own atmospheric spirit or some
evil spirit.
I am going to give him a Magic Mirror I hope it may
be the means of convincing him of the truth or falsehood
of his present belief -- the belief in the rappers is now spreading
rapidly
4158 And will spread much further
I should like to write an article for the Zoist on that subject
4159 I will assist you as much as I can.
Can you tell me why my GS who is also the spirit of
this mirror stays in it so short a time
4160 he would stay much longer if you would
tell him you wished it
I am going to dedicate my new mirror to the AA Michaiel
do you think your sister Selina will be able to see in it
4161 No she will not
The new glass I am having made for showing past events
9
175
Some of them like it, & others do not mind it
What are the best materials -- those mentioned in the Bible
4167 Any common scent does just as well
Now she is gone 20' to 10 PM

10' past 10 PM Michiels Mirror
Invoked Michiel
(instantly) He will appear in it on Tuesday next.

Japan Crystal
Called Mr Anderson
Heres someone come its Sally.
Well Sally how do you do today
4168 Oh never mind about me
Who was that you saw in the crystal on Sunday when we
called for Mr Anderson
4169 A gentleman
She's gone off
Here's Mr Anderson.
4170 Oh. I'm so busy I can't stop, I've got in such
a mess I must go down to Cheltenham. I will
tell you when I get back you should have seen
Sally on Sunday when she got back she was
telling them all what a nice gentleman you are
but I cant stop I must wish you good night
he's pulling on his gloves in such a hurry & has got a parcel in 
his hand
Who was it you sent into the crystal on Sunday
4171 Why her sweetheart to be sure

Called my At Spirit, F. H.
You are here just as you are now dressed.
good evening I am glad you are come
4172 Are you
wheres your diamond studs
4173 upstairs
he's gone.

[symbol] 10 May 1853 C A Mirror
8 h 20 PM.  Invoked the C.A.
The C A is here as usual in white the dress is drawn in tight at
the waist, the gold crown in his hair, wings whitish pink
feathers the whole length of the wings
May I ask why you remain so short a time in the Mirror
4174 because you do not ask me to remain longer
Are there any human Spirits which have passed from this
earth which are not in a state of progress as improvement
4175 yes there are.
Are there any human Spirits in a State of Misery or pain so as to
feel their existence a burthen
4176 No- those spirits who have not been purified for
happiness are in an insensible state.
Are there any who despair of ever attaining the condition of the
blessed.
4177  No
Are there any human souls who since they have left this earth
disbelieve in the existence of a deity 
4178 No - they all believe that because they know it
Is the deity visible in any of the Spheres of this earth.
4179 No
Is this new ability on the part of Mortals to communicate with the
Spirit world by rappings in consequence of any change or
             177
improvement in the Human family
   No all thou plans when the rappings are paid
for by money  all those spirits who rapp are evil                   4180
the other cases are as few as they ever were
What is the spiritual condition of persons who die insane
 4181         The same as the spirits of infants they are not
guilty  of any sins
do human souls ever become so perfect as to live all connexion
with this Earth
4182  Yes
do human souls retain a tangible form
4183  they take the form of human beings
Is there such a thing as marrying in another sphere
4184  No there is not
What are the Chief sins which prevent human souls
attaining happiness in a future state
4185   Murder without repentance is the greatest
General Hayman who was so brutally inclined during the
Hungarian War has died lately and altho one portion of
his body was dead + even mortified yet one side + particularly
an arm and leg reclaimed their warmth + was limp + was 
even buried so had his spirit entirely  left the body

Are you agreeable to have this Mirror dedicated to you
  4189       Yes
and to my calling you to visible apparition therein
 4190  Yes
I was informed by ES that at Mr Slaters house at Somers
Town you caused the rappings to be heard is that the Case
4191   I  only rapped once
have you ever appeared to my Seer before in one of my other
crystals
4192 Yes
did you not tell me then that you preferred to communicate
by rappings rather than appear in crystals
4193    Yes but I would much rather appear in
Mirrors as crystals are too small
will you promise to prevent evil spirits or other frightful
forms appearing in this mirror
4194  Yes
will you show her a vision that will interest + instruct her
4195  I cannot to night
will you do so next Tuesday night
4196   Yes
when we wish to see persons who formerly lived on this
earth but are now deceased how had we better call them
with this mirror
4197  The same as you would spirits
can you tell me why I so seldom obtain answers from the
spirits of deceased persons who appear
 4198  No I cannot

now theres yourself (FH) come in black dark waistcoat
+ black Half - he has Mr D's arm in his
and why have you come masked
4200    Its hard if I cant look at myself without
being asked why I do it
how long have you known that Gentleman on your own
4201     Just as long as he has known me
I remonstrated upon his folly + there appeared
under FH say so
under Mr D how can he have any sense when you have
4202   got it all
How Mr Dresser did you get on with the rappers the [?] evening
Mr D I paid 2/6 and was taken in
4203  FH and I dont believe it
I tried  to dismiss them but they only laughed + put their
tongues out + their fingers to their noses + became longer
 Mr D I am sure you dont mind me staying as
4204          we are such particular friends
FH Have you done with us my dear Sir because
if you have we'l go
Go to the Devil if you like
4205  FH pray dont flurry yourself

on Each side, theres some one Coming in the middle, its the
Lady in the dark dress trimmed with white, she has come
Quite plain—its me—(?) theres some paper in her

The Crowned Angel has invested me with the
Power of Commanding you this instant to
leave the Mirror & never to Enter again unless
you can Answer Questions in a Sensible manner
MrDresser's left. & now She says
ELL
4207
That is quite sufficient he will not appear

Sensible manner.
I shall be very glad to see Either if they will talk rationally
ELL
4208
Why dont you do it Mr Stockley if you dont
I will serve you the same as Mr Dresser & Mr.
Anderson.
F.H.
Why may I not stay
So you may if you will conduct yourself sensibly
4209 F.H.
You shan't say I asked to stay
there you've walked off.
Dear Emma I wish you could tell me something to do 
Emma [?] good
4210
I dont know what would do it any good
how is it clairvoyants can tell what will do persons good
4211
I dont know how it is
Sometime since the late [?] came into the Crystal
wanted a fee of 9 guineas.
4212
It is his ruling passion, he keeps the likeness
of all his gold + gloats over it
What now he's dead + in the Spirit World.
                               181
 4213        he is in the atmosphere + has not ^yet lost any
of that craving for money which he had
when on earth he clings to the earth now
As he is very clever will you ask him to come into the
Mirror + prescribe for her
4214  he would not come if I was to ask him
I dont like him he wishes to live again
I wish I could find something to ease her I am afraid
to Mesmerise her for ti
4215  Nothing will cure it
  Mr Anderson wishes to see you to tell you about
something he saw some time ago which he
forgot to tell you I mean in the body not in
the crystal shall I tell him you will see him
he told me that Lord Stanhope appeared in his
crystal +told him he was quite sure he was
an evil spirit and if you have the same doubts
he has promised never to appear again it was
not the CA who informed Lord Stanhope
Who was it then
4216  I do not know the spirit
It is a wandering spirit + his answers cannot
be depended upon and Lord Stanhope does not
exorcise him properly he does it as he would
take a pinch of snuff or throw himself back
in his carriage
Will you tell me how he is effectively to prevent those Wands
spirits entering his crystal
he cannot do it because he is losing his [?]
4217 in it he repeats the exorcism as tho' he was
repeating some dream or some portion of a dull
letter which was not at all interesting           182
ES is now very much interested by the spirit rapping +
Miss Sally is not so good as I expected
She has not an excellent power of vision
4218       And another thing she will not describe
what she sees but she would be very cross if
she thought  I said so
Emma has not seen any of those beautiful visions she
formerly said and which I should much like her to see
Constantine will show one whenever he is
4219  asked
Mr Anderson is waiting to come in
Ask him to come after supper at 1/2 past 10
she's gone 5 past 10
         Michiels Mirror      (oral)
25 to 11 PM
         Called Mr Anderson
Instantly he is here
       Good evening Sir
The spirits have informed Lord Stanhope that
4220 I am an evil spirit - if you have any
doubt about it The only satisfaction I
can give you is to leave it never to return agn.
Everything I tell you is to my knowledge
quite correct
I experienced the cause of ES's views + also my own +
requested him not to feel offended
Oh yes I can see it - I have seen Mr Hayden
4221 and certainly am of opinion that there
rappings are not caused by good + truthful
                 183
Spirits does it seem likely that good spirits
will just for the sake of putting a [?]
into Mr H's pockets - upsettables + move them
or let a glass either fall off or stop on or a piece
of pencil as the case may be
  Best to all those that are opposed to it
I merely ask them to go and give a patient
hearing and judge for themselves I cannot doubt
the truth of it neither am I satisfied with it
   I am going to tell you a very curious
circumstance that related to me concerning the late
Lady Lovelace a very intimate friend of my
4222  Fathers + also of my own I was coming home
from a short visit on the continent + was staying
at an hotel on the night she died I had dismissed
my valet for the night and was sitting on the
sofa near a large fire in my bedroom there was
no lights except the fire the lower part of the
room was hid by the bed which had very dark
red damask curtains it was about 11 oclock I
have been thinking of different things but that
Lady never entered my mind once I looked
up and to my great surprize I saw a kind
of smoke against the dark hangings of the
bed I could compare it to nothing more than
a large body of steam  it gradually assumed
a human form and to my great surprize +
allmost horror it assumed the form of Ada
Lovelace but what surprized me more was
that her hands were cussed before her and
                          184
on her left hand I perceived three red lines like
small reading in red ink - she has on a white
dress and the whole appeared illumined by
some invisible light from within at the same
time she pointed with the forefinger of her right
hand to the lines on the back of her left I felt
a cold sensation in my left hand + my attent.n
was immediately called to it- + on it were three
distinct lines of reading as tho written with
red ink the hand was white from being
held down + by the firelight I distinctly saw
written on my hand
  Before you reach England Ada Lovelace will
have ceased to exist
4222  I looked up and vision was gone + upon
looking at my hand the reading also was gone
and curious as it may seem I was then not the
least alarmed
  On the following morning  [[I reached England]] 
continued my journey and reached England
not the next but the following night I went
direct to my Fathers house + went into the
Dining Room and the first person I saw was
my sister and she informed me that Lady
Lovelace had died at the same time + at the
same hour as I had seen the apparition
but she said You do not seem surprized at it
I replied I had had a presentiment of it and
that was all I have told any one You are
the only one that has heard it
 " The heiress of my house + heart "
                    185
Have you read the beautiful poems in  Spicers work [?]
to have been communicated by the spirits of Edgar [?]
Clarke + Southey
  Yes I have read Spicers work all thro'
did you ever have any poetry repeated in your crystal
no when they leave this world they seem to lose
all taste for it
did you know the Countess of Lovelace she
was exactly like her Father in her ways I had
been told since she very much wished to see me
at the time
my Father would think I was out of my mind
was I to tell him that
From whom do you inherit your happy gift of spirit seeing
none of my family can see that I know of
not but what I have plenty of relations goodness
knows
Well they are handy when they have plenty of [?] to leave you
Have you seen W H lately
 O I know such a lack about that
Tell it us
 If I did Miss (Selina) would blow me up
well I cant say I understand the whole of it
my crystal's too small so if there's any diff.cl
I cant tell who the parties are but it tickles
my fancy very much
lets have it
Oh Miss (Selina) dont like my telling it
but I'll send him I'm so bashful telling any
thing to the Ladies
Well first of all there was a small house came

                      186
Pa + Ma safe in bed I hope then in about 3 minutes
a fly pulls up at the Door and a certain Lady
and a Gentleman and another Lady + gentleman
and one of the Gent.n was Mr WH-
  Mr WH went out in the evening with Mr
Scott of Conn I cant tell but what she came
home again presently another Gentleman came
We then had a long dialogue not needful to describe at length
+ at 1/4 past 11 PM he said
 4223 I must wish you good night
+ left
     [?] 20' May 1853
20 to 8  Michiels Mirror
  Smoked Michiel -     [?]
4224   She is Engaged
     Called S L
there's some one come in black its Miss Cook - dress tight
round the waist
Why are you dressed in black
4225  (no answer)
Will you tell me your name
          Sally Cook
4226   You want to make me go but I shant I dont
see why I shouldn't come as well as any one else
how do you get on with the mirror I gave ES
I could obtain no answer but she stood looking quite straight
at Emma + I tried to dismiss her but in vain
She (ESS) shant come I shall stay till its
dark            4227
                      187
You may go to Old Nick if you like
  4228   I shall have capital company for you will
be there no doubt
now theres some one else come beside her he's got a smock
frock on nailed boots and a blue Haf a beaver hat and a 
bundle tied up in a red handf. + stick
What is your name
I could get no answer but it getting very dark they became
indistinct I [?] told Sally it was a pity she could not stop 
4229     You shall see us again presently I'll fetch
a candle
1/4 past 8
10' past 8 Emma looked into the Mirror + there appeared
a beautiful room very long its getting plainer + very
large its a beautiful room theres a very large easy chair
armed back gilt and green velvet - the window contains
green a very large cord 2 long windows the bottom of
one is open and there is beautiful flowers outside and
underneath the green curtains theres white lace now theres
two more chairs like the other and a beautiful bird
hanging up and a little fountain with two birds [?]
a beautiful carpet theres a gentleman in one of the
chairs a marble fire place with a carved head under the
Mantlepiece its very light in the room theres a little
painted table near the Gent.n with a view on it a scarlet
book + silver nickstand- green pen with gold crown
the Gent.n has a silk Haf up to his face as tho he had
the Toothache the pens in the other hand he's holding somethg
up to his face he's looking into a box and writing away
he has black Trousers and such a smart waistcoat white
and Red two deep falls to his shirt its not a coat he has


22
188
has on it red about the shoulders & black below.  hes flung
something at the bird & said 
4230  hold your tongue chatterbox, theres something
for you, either talk or hold your tongue do.
his face is so swelled
you have a troublesome visitor
4231  It's very annoying particularly tonight
do you ever have any persons appear in your mirror you
cant get rid of.
4232  When I cant get rid of them I put it away
I discharge it first of course
Heres another visitor, be off sir do
Its a large dog that has poked his nose in at the door
4233  I am not in England now I'm at Marseilles
I must give it up
have you got your crystal with you
Yes but its not unpacked.
4234  That is the reason I do not allow any of my
friends even to know that I use it.
Have you heard any thing about table moving lately
4235  Oh yes France is full of it, so discussed at every
table now.  I believe the emperor is a great believer
I think he has a Crystal
have you seen him lately
It got dark in the Crystal all at once, we had no light, 10' to 9 PM.
ES. Crystal
5' to 9.  Invoked Constantine
Heres Sally with a candle
Sally would not answer us  and I could not get rid of her
Therefore took up my oval mirror.
23
189
Michiels Mirror                                                
Called Mr Anderson                                         
Heres the same room & Mr Anderson looking at the same thing
4236 She wont go Mr Hockley, its very seldom my
temper is ruffled, but to think you cant get 
rid of her is annoying, how is she in the body
I have never seen her
nor I except in company with ES.
4237 Some time ago when the rappings were heard 
I used the exorcism for evil spirits and they 
immediately ceased.
I intend to try that with Mrs Heydon
4238 I think with her its hopeless. When I did so
it was with the wish of the medium, & Mrs.
Heydon would never give her consent to that it
makes I think little difference to her whether
they are good or evil, its astonishing how many 
go to hear her tho' I should think she has not
had less than a 1000 persons since she has
been in  England
directly I come back I shall have another 
trial I think
Once when they were rapping I asked are you
the spirit of my sister
Yes
What is your name 
No
When did you die
Yes
What was your age when you died
No
that alone shows the spirit who answered knew nothing abt it
34
190
ES informs me he has been answered very correctly to
mental questions

4238
I took the alphabet and the raps were
heard as I pointed to the different letters -- 
that would be something for Charles Dickens
if he knew.
have you seen Mr Heyden at all
Have you read Spicers work

I wish you would send me a newspaper to Croydon as a 
convincing proof of the truth of these curious matters -- I tried
from many ways, but he evaded it by trifling answers.
We were then using the mirror & I asked him to come into
the ES crystal as Sally still remained there

ES Crystal
Sally still being there Mr Anderson came in & said

4239 Mr Hockley seems tired of your company
Miss -- allow me to see you safe out -- (he
offered her his arm) If you don't come as 
you ought to do I'll fetch a shutter & carry 
you out. after a good deal of banter he took
her off against her will, she trying to get 
away & he pulling her along & so put her out

1/2 past 9.
Upon taking up Michiels mirror she appeared there
& immediately after in the ES crystal & not being able 
to get rid of her from the mirror, I called Mr A who
came in & said

4240 I think Mr Hockley I shall put my good
manners in my pocket & kick her out. & I
must be dreadfully annoyed to do that.

he did it & she left.
25
191
The mirror became veiled & she again appeared, appearing
instantly in either & I could not get rid of her.

[symbol] 31 May. C A mirror
8h'20 PM.  Invoked the CA
The mirror became immediately clouded & Sally appeared
in a black dress full faced towards Emma her hands straight
down by her side.  I made every possible exertion to induce her
to leave or to speak but without any success only once the
word yes appeared.  She remained in 20' when we left off.
She still being in the mirror we took up
The ES. Crystal
The crystal became immedly. clouded & Sally appeared in it
upon [?] to the CA Mirror which was quite clear Sally
entered that & then on our taking up the ES she left that
& entered the crystal
Called Mr Anderson
Sally then got smaller & Mr Anderson appeared very excited
4241 I never was so vexed in my life
I showed my crystal to a lady who is now
in Marseilles & no one will appear but a man
 in a smock frock with a stick & a bundle over
his shoulder who says he is the intended of
Sally Cook ES's seer it very annoying
I told him my difficulty with Sally
4242 it is very annoying the fellow stands there
with his mouth open is there any way I 
can assist you
Now I can find a way to send her off at least 
I shall in a few minutes, I will call a friend 
of mine a young lady or I will be back in a
few minutes.

                   192
Sally  remaining in the crystal
       Michiels Mirror
          Called Mr Anderson
9 PM
Theres Mr A sitting in a room with his crystal in his hand
I think she is prevented from entering now
4243    but my man is not gone I hope I shall
know how to prevent them appearing when
I return to London
Why do you think Sally will not reappear
  I called the AS Spirit of one who I know
4244   uses a dismissal for atmosphere spirits in
the body and he immediately dismissed her
Then he has done me the good [?] for which I invoked
your assistance
 4245  then if I am no longer any use I'll go
I always invoke spirits first but I shall be much
obliged by your appearing in an hours time
4246 Oh certainly it is best I will come good bye
Emma then took the ES crystal and a man in a smock
frock a brown one appeared with a stick over his shoulder
[?] a blue cotton Half bundle with white spots
he has rather a red face thick nose wide mouth
+ the wind blows the bearer of his hat very short neck
leather leggings + laced up boots hes put his bundle

he then went out leaving his bundle of turnip tops + stick
on the ground in about 3 minutes he came back with
a hat and his face red and a pot in his hand a pewter
pot he then drank + presently put his hand up to his
mouth + hallowed hoy- hoy- to some one in the [?]
Now there's two men + a woman they are country
people waddling along one has a Jim Crow hat on with
a piece out of the brim Corduroy Jacket red plain waistcoat
+ laced up boots the other has a light grey smock frock
worked on the shoulders + a black hat the woman has

No Vision
past 10 Called  Mr Anderson
he is here in black coat, cape and, black studds



                      195
Well Mr Anderson we have been annoyed all the evening with your
smock frock friend
4255     No friend of mine rather an enemy I should say
I told him the vision we had had
 then it must have been in the latter end of
January or the beginning of February the fellows'
4256        half an idiot
 did he tell you any bodys name he talked a good
deal in my crystal about Mr Zuddon
during the last two evenings I have been prevented by these
atmosphere spirits from doing any thing with my crystals
4257  It's very provoking its so different from
themselves - as for Sally I never saw her
are there times when you cannot get the spirits to appear
in your crystal
  It is foolish to suppose that the sublime and
the ridiculous approach so near that before
4258    the crystal is clear of the spirit of a fool
an angel would appear in it
      When it is interrupted by an atmospheric
spirit I cease to use it for that evening much
as it annoys me very often
Yes but as I only use it once a week now I am thereby thrown
over for a week
4259     Are you confined to that time
have you seen or heard any of the spirit rappings or movings lately
Oh yes hats, workboxes + tables are flying in all
4260         directions here they have a much quicker way of
doing it here than in England
I saw a work table turned bottom upwards
placed upon a tumbler with four persons having
The mirror Mr A was here present in (Michaels) had a wooden
back of polished mahogany -- and the paper was on the table at the
back of the mirror. Selina sat with her ale glass having her supper & the
letter for ES was also on the table & all of them at the back of the 
mirror.

It is very curious that altho he so frequently notices Selina
and delights in teazing her by calling her "Miss" he never
looks at Emma, or addresses or even in any way allude to her
196
            abandon
4261       on each leg spins round with great velocity
          How do you like your square Mirror
We had some conversation on other matters + there was a newsp.r
laying on the table & he said
4262 Is that an Australian paper Mr Hockley
No its the Examiner
4263 Oh I beg your pardon I could only see the last letters
--
Is that Brandy & water in your glass Miss
--
Thats a thick one for Lord Stanhope
I also had a chat about Mrs Heydon & her "Mission to free her Name."
If you obtain the form to prevent At. Spirits appearing will
you oblige me with it.
4264 Certainly, I have no doubt of the truth of 
Mrs Heydon but 10 out of 15 of the others
I have not the slightest confidence in.
You promised me one evening the words of your Call for
the crystal is it convenient for you to give it me this ev.g
4265 It is a written one I will fetch it now if you
prefer it -- or you shall have it next time
You are going to be in the fashion are you
not Miss (looking at Selina) a Spicers jacket
Goodnight Sir 
4266 Good night Sir, Good night dear Miss (to Selina)
he left 1030 PM.

[symbol] 14 June 1853
25' past 9 PM Japan Crystal
Called Mr Anderson
he is here instantly -- has on a lavender watered waistcoat & black
studs -- he is using a white silk handf.
197
Good Evening Mr A
4267        Good evening Sir
when shall you return to England
4268 on the 15th June
Shall you be at the Mesmeric Infirmary meeting on Friday
instead of answering he began whistling + looking about him
We have had our evenings quite upset by Sally + others appearing
remaining in spite of our efforts to dismiss them
4269        thats very annoying
And I cannot obtain visions to appear of spirits
4270      unless they appear before mortals it is very
seldom they appear after them
have you read any of the newspapers on spirit rappings yet
ES had kindly sent me about 50
  I have had a great many books on the

I find it so
well dear Miss (to Selina) Miss is like a
certain lady we know, when she sits down
(in Scotland) she eats as much as she can
for Lunch + then walks down to some of the
Laborers Cottages + eats head + cheek, comes
home and eats 3 times as much as any one
at table
that I suppose makes her face so purple
Its only an Elegant bloom
4272 spirit rappings on getting very much out of
my favor, its so prevalent in France + Germany
198
that its positively a nuisance at least the
impostors. I think the great part can be
explained by the Table turning and as for
the rapping, at one place there was a cellar
+ some one rapping underneath with a stick
such things as that in one place shakes your
faith in them all
That is bad logic but from what we know by using the
Crystal I do not see any reason to doubt the truth of the
rappings  the only thing I object to is as to their goodness +
whether they are really the souls of ^the ^ deceased persons they
represent themselves to be
4273   I wish you would just hear them
ES has given me an introduction to Mr Slater whose [med'n?]
I believe corrected Robert Owen the philanthropist
Have you seen Dr Ashbunner's letter in the Reasoner to Mr
Holyoake
4274    No I suppose theres several new pamphlets
out since I was in England  I heard there
was one or two expected from good quarters
(to Selina) I hope you enjoy your head
+ cheek Miss- I think Sallad! a capital
thing oh dont I thats all - talking about
that I want my supper

4275 I dont know who you mean

The crystals veiled , theres a marble pillar with a gilt chain
down at the bottom , its a beautiful marble carved pillar flat
at the top and such a beautiful gold Chain round the bottom
it looks almost transparent now the gold chain is fastened 
to a white bird with a gold head and there is some one stand.g
beside it in black - Oh I see it plainer now the Bird has
got a gold head + so beautiful shaded with gold its like
a dove in its mouth is a flat shaped heart like cardboard
one half black and the other white , and a broad red band
round the outside theres reading in the heart engraved on
white letters  on the black + black letters on the white , it gets
more beautiful and so bright that it hurts my eyes the
feathers are silvery white + shades gradually off to a
beautiful gold at the edge
I here got Michiels Mirror + instantly it veiled + Emma said
now the Pillar's forming so large and the bird is as large
as a real dove 
Will you please to inform me if that Dove is a spirit

The shields gone + only the pedestal bird + Lady's there + underneath

It shall be seen plainer tomorrow evening
Will you tell me if there is any method of preventing the
appearance of those persons who have annoyed us lately so
much
4284  Peace did not reign between the Atmospheric
Spirit of Sally Cook and yours, peace has
parted them and she will now cease to annoy
you
there appears leaves carved round the pedestal the dove
moves his feet. now the chain's unfastened + fallen down
can you tell me by what means Dr Ashburner's hand is
moved when he conceived it to be done by his father
4285      his Father's pure spirit could not come in
contact with a human spirit - he grieves
that his son is misled by an evil spirit

nearest has a purple robe & in the middle is the white
marble pillar and dove, and little children in white
with red roses round their heads & pink round their waists
then theres some old soldiers with crimson dresses & helmets
theres one figure with crimson velvet robe & ermine, black
hat and white feather black satin breeches & white silk
stockings -- and next him 3 ladies on this side they look
like mortals, on the other side those in white are angels on the
side with the angels are a good many dressed in black
most of them have little things on their heads with reading 
on. they have all wings the white angels one has purple 
velvet robes & broad white silk bands and loaded with
diamonds -- green white red & yellow stones. and such 
heavenly faces, and all the soldiers have flags and theres
writing on them. and all they stand on is purple velvet
with gold stars, and the the farther end is a gold throne
& down the middle are 4 pillars with gold & white birds
one looks like a large eagle. on the wing of the dove [?] are 
gold letters "peace" the throne at the top is all gold but
the dresses of the mortals are all imaginable colors. Green 
& blue silk coats & dress swords. over the mortals is written
4287 "Spirits risen from the People"
There are all sorts of grades -- policemen dressed like ours
& their names I suppose under them. I cannot make them out
because they keep coming & going so
Theres one in crimson velvet robe & black silk breeches & under
him is 4288 "Edward"
Theres one with very white beard & a little black cap & a black robe on
very old indeed "John Dee"
4289
202
theres another  just like the last
theres a small man dressed in black
 4290  "John Ash---
No this name is under next now theres Wm. Ash---
theres one lady dressed very beautiful with a child with long
curly hair dressed in white with Dark blue velvet mantle
a Crown on her head + a great deal of gold round her neck
  4291  Charlotte of Belgium
A girl with short blue dress + shawl old bonnet no shoes or
stockings  4292  Susan Baynes
under a short old man with white hair white whiskers
+ with a bear skin + a fur cap he looks so droll
  4293  Franklin
under one in a black dress + white wig + a long white beard
  4294  Archdeacon Spenser
The one dressed so magnificently in purple velvet is the Crowned
Angel- + such a splendid gold Crown
The Mortals seem of all Nations one with Crimson velvet robes
close to one without shoes or stockings and fresh ones keep
coming up behind them theres reading under all + the flags

Theres 2 young gentlemen in claret colored coats red
velvet breeches diamond buckles in their shoes their eyebrows

She stands next the Duchess Montespan
The Mortals keep moving but the angels stand quite
still and never move
Now theres another in green muslin delaine dress black
jacket and white cap trimmed with white

Now the Crowned angel has come forward and all the
spirits have formed a half circle round him all the
Mortals have left and the Dove angel is there
May I ask the meaning of the vision we have seen
  4299     You asked if any spirits had risen who
have dwelt upon this earth and I have
shown you those that have done so
do the spirits of those who are so long since deceased still
retain their former appearance + dress
 4300    No they appear the same as other spirits
but they assume that dress that you
might distinguish one from the other
May I ask the reason of the ineffectual attempts I have
204
made to see you in this mirror
  4301        I could not appear when the atmospheric
spirit of a mortal occupied it
Can you tell me any formula by which I can prevent their
appearing 
 4302  Forms are of no service they will not
appear again to annoy you
Hes gone
20' past 9 PM To see ELL

hour
30' p. 9
10 PM The C A is here and the Dove Angel
4304  As Sally Cook has annoyed you so much
lately Evani has taken the place of
Constantine and will perform all those
duties which Constantine so carefully fulfilled
 -
4305 Ann is not the Guardian spirit of Dr. Jno.
Ashbonner
Will you please to tell who is his GS
  4306  His Father acts in that Capacity
Will his Father appear in the mirror I gave to Dr AC
4307   I will enquire of him and at the same
time I may say that it would be much
better for the people of England were
they not so infatuated with the rapping
spirits
Can you tell me any way by which I can convince a 
sceptical friend of the Truth of these Visions
 4308  You cannot convince them
205
For when a person is present who does
not believe in them it break that spell
which exists between the person + the spirits
and which for the time being places
them in Communion with them.
When mortals [f??m] Ideas—do those Ideas always exist
or by what means are they reproducible
4309
They always exist.
But when Ideas are unfortunately so often [ill] Evil
Cannot they be destroyed
4310
[?e?e] there no Evil there would be no good
for as dark as the Evil is, so bright is
the good that follows it.
Were there no misery we could not tell
what happiness was.
When speaking of deceased persons should I say Souls
of the deceased or spirits of the Deceased
4311
Souls of the Deceased + atmospheric Spirits
of those that are living
Where in the living body is the seat of the Soul
4312
the brain is the seat of the soul and the
intellect is the soul or part of the Soul
And that makes the difference between
Human beings + animals
Animals have spirits without souls
do[es] the Spirits of Animals exist after they are killed
on this Earth
4313
her
do the Souls of deceased Mortals remember after they leave
this Earth what happened to them during their Earthly life
4314
No as they attain happiness they lose
Every idea of it — while they have one 
206
particle of remembrance of what existed in
this world or what happened to them on this
Earth they could not be happy in a finer 
place
E.S.'s ancestor the first Earl it has been supposed was poisoned

Brighton, when you ment.d the other evening

same now. theres all the Lanterns (the feast of Lanterns)
theres all the fireworks just the same only so small
theres the ducks theres the Rockets with the different
colors theres the Turnabout one, but the scene does not look
so pretty because I can see the Canvass which looks like

pretty now theres the ship on Fire coming out, I can see
the place where the Band is, Theres Mr Richards + Selina
I cant see you (F.H.) now I see you. but you are by yourself

4329  No I have not
I have here a black magic made for Ms Dresser had
it better be dedicated to his PS
4330  Yes it had

dedicate it to Lero  Mr H Leas PS
4331  Yes
Will you ask Lero to appear in if when called
4332  I will
One of the spirit rapping mediums received a very beautiful poem
in the style of Edgar A Poe & said to be delivered by his Spirit
4333  I am certain it was not him and I don't know
a spirit who would do so
Can I request a Spirit to deliver a poem or verses to me in this
mirror
Now there's appeared
this & under it –
xxxxxxxxxxxx | xxxxxxxxx | xxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxx | xxxxxxxxx | xxxxxxxxx
xxxxxxxxxxxx | xxxxxxxxx | xxxxxxxxx
4334  This is the only idea the Spirits can give you of
poetry
do the souls of deceased poets retain their happy talent for
poetry.
4335  They lose all knowledge of things pertaining
to the world as they attain to perfect happiness
and when they approach true happiness they
have not one single recollection of any thing
which happened to them or any thing they knew
unless it is a second gift.

210
But the rapping Spirits relate when where they died [?]
advice & sometimes predict events.
Amongst all the rappings which have excited
4336 So much interest, not more than 4 Separate raps
have been given by good Spirits at the request
of deceased relatives to the parties who heard them
Is there any objection to my going to [?] States to investigate
the rappings
4337 No there is not
Can you instruct me in any means by which I could
test whether they were good spirits or not when they rap
If you use the discharge which you [?] [?]
4338  Spirits - and at the same time ask the Spirit
that raps to tell you the name of your G.D.
You will know that [?ay] whether the name is
right or wrong.  Every good Spirit is aware of
Anothers .G.D.
Can you tell me what [keeping] this Fragment of Stone with Greek
and Hebrew Characters. was intended for.

4343 He is well but being slightly indisposed I do

An objection to it.

Dr Dee received a great number of lengthened & curious revelatns.
from Various Spirits would one of those spirits Appear in
My Crystal if I were to call him

4350 They would do so
Is there any objection to my calling them into my ES
Crystal. I mean have you as my GS any objection

4351 They would much rather Appear in this
mirror as when they are enclosed in a ball

Have you any objection to answer me that question
 4358         I have
What answer shall I return to her letter
           The Divining of spirits is generally used
for a higher purpose than idle curiosity
4359          or the speculation of a husband if it is
ordained that she shall marry either
it is also ordered that she shall marry
that one which would be most conducive
to her happiness
If the souls of deceased persons do not remember anything
that happened to them on earth How was [?]
enabled to tell me the place + manner of his death
        It was me that have the answers he
 did not speak + so it is whenever illusion
4360    is made by spirits who are happy to any
thing that happened to them on earth
as they attain happiness they lose all
remembrance of what happened to them
on earth + when they attain complete
happiness they lose all knowledge of
216
their former state for while any rememb.ce
clings to them they could not possibly be
happy in their former state
By what means then did Eml. Swedenborg obtain from a
deceased person the information relative to a deed which his
widow could not find
4361       That person appeared but the answers were
given by GROTUIC who had never dwelt
upon earth
By what means did the mortal known as the Solitaire of
Philadelphia in America put himself into an apparent
Trance at the request of a Lady and visit her husband in
London + obtain the knowledge when he wd return.
4362  He was endowed with supernatural agency
his was indeed a rare & singular case.
Earl Stanhope informs me that the Rapping Spirits
correctly told him the name, place of decease, & date of
decease of a particular friend. How was that done
4364  The rappings are made by evil spirits, if 
they did not mix themselves with men on
Earth, they would not have the slightest
idea of time, however low their state might
be so long as they were good spirits --
I have read that in Germany & even in Wales, when a new
Mine was about to be opened, the miners would here a great
noise as if invisible miners were there at work -- which noises
they believe to be caused by spirits
4365 It is scarcely necessary for me to say that
Any good spirits cannot come in contact 
with any solid substance or even approach
it within a certain distance, any further than
this I cannot explain those noises
217
May I then ask how you and other good spirits have appd.
to enter our Crystals first appearing outside & then seeming to 
enter.
4366 The shadow is thrown into the crystal
Whenever I approach the [?] it appears
in the crystal, when I stop at a certain dist.ce
that also appears to stop, and when I 
approach nearer, that appears to close its 
wings and enter.
Mr Henry Spicer in his publication called
Sights and Sounds states that a paper was
signed by a number of Spirits on the Table 
of an American Medium and when shown 
Afterwards they were declared to be the
exact signatures of celebrated deceased persons
This document not being in some
way perfect the Spirits instructed him to
burn it and they would sign another, which
he did it was again laid upon the table
and nine signatures were attached to it.
In this Mr Henry Spicer was in some
way deceived it was utterly without found.n
and never occurred.
Spirits could not, I mean those who
never dwelt upon Earth, could not mark
paper with ink So that it would last
they might make an impression on it
which would not last more than 3 minutes
No spirit ever signed that paper
I have a copy of that document upstairs & it was presumed
to be signed by the departed spirits of the mortals named
4367 Yes but not even spirits who had never
52
218
been on earth could have signed it -- much
less spirits who had so lately left it.

Called Mr Anderson
Now theres something white & peaked come, upon the top
is a flag, in at the further end is a fire, its all open on 
this side theres 5 gentlemen round the fire, there all
sorts of things in it, there a bed it looks like a mattress
on 4 flower pots and thats covered with blue halfway
& then over that theres a pole and hangings fall over at
each end that very close the fire, theres 5 gentlemen
sitting on the side of the bed one on a stool & one seems
half laying on a sofa the other is sitting I cannot
see what on theres a little table and a good many
bottles on it. Mr Anderson's sitting on the bed he has
got on black trousers with a red stripe & a blanket
over his shoulders doubled like a shawl & his head
sticking up -- none of them have coats on they all
look to have colored things round them one has a 
plaid wrapped round him and another a great colored
Hdf like a scarf, there plenty of bottles.

What day is it with you Mr. A.
4372  Saturday
They have all got Moustacios but one he has yellowish light hair rather
a red face He's the one with the Red plaid
4373  Mr A  Theres been enough rain today, talk about roughing
it at the diggings, it would be the abode of bliss to
this.
You don't look very [ill?]
4374  It's best put a good face on & set a good example
The might have picked out a better spot than
this for their encampment don't you think so
Theres no treading out of this in the dark for the
holes besides the wet sand & the adders
What a very wet day it's been
Have you got your Crystal with you
4375  No I've not, I'm going to London on the 15th
July
They[?ed] to change all your Regiments then dont they
4376  They will be relieved somewhere about that time
but not on that day I believe
So you have had the Prince to "tough" it with you how came
the Little Lady to let him "Sleep from home"
4377  She could not complain of him this time for
he went away directly it was over, & as to his
sleeping out I suppose she couldn't help it
but she had the satisfaction of knowing he 
had no companions (ladies I mean) I dare
say he caught it when ge got back--
he is the only man in England that has 
a "right" to be henpecked.
Well hes well paid for his services
4378  And he behaves accordingly
221
how was it your dandy Regiment was afraid of wetting their white
Ducks the other day & let the Scot's go thro the pond.
4379  Oh did they
Ive got rid of my troublesome visitors & the CA says I shall not
be troubled by them again.
4380  I'm glad of that. good night
10' to 10 PM.

[?] July 12 1853   C A Mirror
           Invoked the C A
The C A appd in purple velvet very plain
Will you kindly inform me why we did not obtain any responses
from you on last Tuesday evening
        I appeared to show you that I did not neglect
4412    the summons but I could not stay on account
   of my being engaged with other spirits
I presume that was also the case with [?] the Dove Angel
4413      It was
Mr Lenny Richards the father of my friend Arthur Augustus Richards
did about a fortnight ago + before his death he asked 3 times for his
Son Arthur can you tell me what he wanted to say to him
    He was conscious he was about to leave the world
4414      and before doing so he now regrets that he could
not have taken leave of all his Friends
have you any objection to ask him to appear next Tuesday Ev.
if his son Arthur is here + wishes  to ask any question
        It would be much better if you were to wait some
4415      time longer he not having yet thrown off the whole
of his Corporal being
I thank you when the proper time comes you will please to inform us
4416      I will tell you and you shall see him
I went last evening at Earl [?] request to Mrs Hater's to hear
the spirit rappings they appear as yet but imperfect mediums but
I heard the rappers and they correctly answered my mental
questions and one of the spirits stated himself to be Benj Franklin
the celebrated Printer Author + Statesman  was that correct
        The first spirit who rapped was one who was sent by
4418       Benj Franklin and invested for the time with the
knowledge which he possessed on this earth
the next spirit who rapped [?] properly directed

                             5
would have spelled his name upon the Alphabet
was Charles Gore Honslow
Was that the spirit withstood my conjuring him of [?]
to depart
  4418         Yes he was not Earl neither was he of a high
order not having been dead long but he would
rap again if requested so to do + answer all
questions concerning himself
But I first wish to ask your permission to do so will you give
it me + guard us from all evil that might arise from consulting
the rapping spirits
 4419        Yes I will guard against every evil but do not
upon my account go to Mr Haydons for the
moment you hear at Mr Haydons spiritual
visions will forever vanish
I here said as the writing is so indistinct shall I get candles
         No in a moment it will be stronger
I have hitherto guarded you against all those
slight accidents that are always falling to the
4420     lot of mortals I will continue to do so as long
as it lays in my power
         I will presently tell you the reason why
 the answers do not appear plain at first sight
and why after part of a sentence becoming plain
the other appears so indistinct that you are
not able to read it
      Will you tell the Gentleman who calls himself
Mr Anderson when he appears next in your crystal
that he should not trouble himself so much
about colors neither should he expostulate with
his friend upon it
61
6
4421 Tell them that the Royal Scarlet and the
Imperial Purple make no difference in the
SPIRITUAL world.
I cannot express myself to him as I could
wish he cannot undersatnd me. When I said 
that white was a Heavenly Garment I did not
mean that it was only the highest of all
spirits that appeared in it but that being
a pure spotless and           color it was more
fitting for a spirit of light, than of darkness
will you make him understand this.
Most assuredly.
4422 I will appear again in five minutes
9h.5' PM (Candlelight)
4423 The writing which is seen in this mirror is done
by the spirit forming the letter in his mind
as each word passes thro his mind so they take
the form of a reality & appear.
The seer who sees and the spirit thro 
whose mind these ideas pass is for the time one
but they are united by so slight a cord, that
the slightest thought jars it or severs it. When
it is joined as it were the writing appears so
small that it cannot be understood & when it
is quite severed the writing disappears until the
bond is again complete, they see with the spirits 
eyes and they read what is impressed upon the 
spirits mind, it takes the form of a reality and
their mind appears a blank space
I have been informed at Mr Slaters that I can become a
writing medium and can develope it in 5 months but I do
not wish to cease in rapport with my spirit I do not know
62 
7
and will therefore entirely rely upon you for guidance
4424 It would be prejudicial to you 
In the first place you could not ascertain whether 
those spirits who guided your hand were really
and truly what they profess themselves to be
You might receive communications from them which
would so prey upon your mind that it would
incapacitate you from the every day duties of 
life --
The statements they made would be most
probably one half of them not true or if the
foundations were true they would be much exaggerated
Were they to give you what would appear,
or I should rather say to be more plainly 
understood --
They would begin by giving what w.d
appear to you or any other mortal good and
sound advice given in high flow and elegant
language, they would then work upon and
get you to agree with them in their opinions
and so work upon your incredulity that they 
would entirely get you in bondage and lead you
as I fear in the case of Dr Ashburner into
great error
I ret.d thanks.
4425 but at the same I wish you to exercise that judgment
which it has pleased the Divine Judgment to give
you for investigating all matters, that you may
be able at the end of a short time to see if your
hand is guided by a spirit
That will enlighten you so far that you will
be able to tell whether you have the power or not
63
8
that will be a satisfaction to you
Am I to understand that I am to wait patiently and see if
the power developes itself in me naturally
4426 You can try in a short time hence whether it is
developed or not.
I will do so and trust to you to prevent any evil arising from it
4427 I will do so
May I enquire at Earl Stanhopes request by what means you know
the circumstances about the doucment in Spicers work have you
ever read that work.
4428 No but I was so far in contact with his Atmos.c
Spirit that I could understand he was writing it
ES informs me that Tescho is no longer his GS. does that 
arise from his having given or lent his crystal to Sir Edw.d
Lytton Bulwer, or can you tell me who is now E.S's GS.
4429 I hope for the sake of your bodily as well as
spiritual happiness that you will not consult 
Mrs Heydon
Emma remarked the CA was going and I ret.d thanks when the
CA again became largner & turned round & Emma observed
"he looks so sorrowful"-
20' to 10 PM.
E.S. Crystal
1/4 to 10. I asked will the spirit who rapped for me at Mr Slaters
last night appear in this crystal
4430 No he will not
May I ask why not
4431 because he does not like being exorcised
Will he rap on my table as he promised
4432 No answer.
I then asked twice the spirit who rapped for me at Mr Slaters
& who called himself Chas Gore Onslow would rap 3 times
64
9
The spirit did not rap and Emma remarked that the mirror
had veiled & she read therein
4433 "He cannot appear or rap unless the mirror & crystals
are discharged
Is it with your permission that I discharge the crystals or am
I to refrain from asking him to rap.
4434 The only objection to his rapping this evening is
that the rappings will be very much louder than
at Mr Slaters and on the wall and that Selina
would hear them & become alarmed.
We then discontinued trying to obtain the rappings & at
?' past 10PM. Called Mr Anderson
hes come but very large in plain clothes black trousers broad
snuff colored stripe down lavender waist.t black dress coat
& 3 rings on each hand on his right one on the little finger
2 on the next on the left 2 on the little finger & 1 on the next.
4435 Good evening Sir
I have been directed by tbe CA to inform you something
about colors.
4436 O that is what I have been trying to learn
I then repeated the CA's response
4437 Thank you
I will tell you what it has reference to
I wanted a small desk made of pine wood
to hold the whole of my spiritual matters. I 
asked the permission of the spirit of my crystal 
to have it made It was immediately directed to me
pinewood I went and had it made & when I had
it home it was very rough on the inside & looked
unfinished and I wanted to line it with something
& asked what color it was first my intention of lining
it with black velvet but then I heard you say that
6510
that instead of black at the back of the mirror you
was advised to have it silvered.  I thought some other
color would be desirable, I was undecided what I
should have and I went to a friend of mine who
knows something about the occult sciences & asked
his opinion, he began losing [?] me, I mentioned
[?green] that would not do upon my account then
inclined [?purple] I did not think the colors so
particular - oh simple that was equally bad he said I named all the colors but [?] seemed to
[?] except white [?]  I was perfectly [?] 
to have abox lined with white velvet which we [?] 
to knock about he got rather angry over [?] and
at last was mutually agreed that we should
ask the spirits what colors would be best which I
am sorry [?]  was not done in the first instance.

I did so and went [?] all the colors beginning
with white which was the only one they had [?] 
objection to that [?] .

[?]   [?]  encouraged [?] 
purple was the highest of all colors in which
a spirit could clothe himself and I had no 
business to line my box [?]  [?] 

[M?] [?]  told me was downright     [?] 
any polish upon it

I could [?]  [?]  color in which good spirit delighted
but they did not wish me for some purpose [?] 
which I would not tell [?]  it [?] box
and then I did not know what to do, I again
applied to the spirit of my crystal and asked
decideddly what color I should have.  I was 
told I have been answered that [?]  before

66
11
and now I am not to trouble myself so much
about colors, the box wants lining & its very ridiculous
to me to line it with white velvet do you not
think so- I did not have it smoothed & polished
in consequence of intending to line it, and inside
it looks nasty & another thing I intended to have 
a small writing desk on the top of it all complete
& that must be covered in the same colored velvet
or cloth else I might just as well write upon the
Table, All this has taken place since Saturday
I had a leave of Absence until Wednesday morning

I will ask next Tuesday for you if you wish
4439 I shall be very glad

Can you Come into our crystal next Friday Evening
4440 I will come with pleasure if my military
duties will permit (laughing)

4441 Its not Lord George Bentinck, he died some time
ago, its Colonel Bentinck, I think theres not
the slightest hopes of his recovery, it was a
shocking thing--

Shall we have a war with Russia after all
4442 No one can tell that.

We are now obliged to leave & will wish you good night
4443 The Prince is very ill, I hope I shall not have
the measles, I was with him a short time
before good night.

A clergyman has lately written a pamphlet to prove that
table moving is of Satanic Origin, he states that a table
put in motion by himself his curate & wife was stopp.d
[in] the midst of its girations by having a small Bible
placed upon it -- that was the reason of its doing so.
4449 The table was moved by untruthful
spirits and the bible being the most holy
book of truth they could not withstand it.
Would so simple a circumstance as those gentlemen & a lady
sitting down merely to try a physiological fact and
not a psychological one be a sufficient inducement or 
summons to call evil spirits into their company
4450 The tables are in most cases moved by 
evil spirits, and unless the party sits down
with a mental prayer to the Most High
that whatever movement may take place
or whatever answer is obtained may be by 
good and truthful spirits -- if not evil
spirits will immediately attend you or
if not evil spirits, some of those wand.g
spirits who are always roaming about
& bring themselves in close contact with
persons in the Mesmeric State
Will you inform me on Thursday Ev.g next the name
of Mr EG -- who now holds my seers hand -- Guardian
Spirit
4451 I will tell you this evening but I cannot on Thursday

has Mr EG the power of seeing in the crystal
     4452        No he has not
What's the name of the [Governing?] Spirit of my Japan
Crystal. as I have not invoked in it lately
     4453       ADA
Will Ada please to appear on Thursday evening if I call
     4454      She will appear this evening
I wrote to ES about his becoming a writing medium
Can you give me any advice on that subject
     4455      ANGELA
Is that Mr Ed.d G's Guardian Spirit
     4456     Yes.
Of what order is Angela
     4457     AAI The same as Evani the Dove angel
Will Angela appear in this mirror when called
     4458     She will
Is she a good and truthful spirit
     4459     Yes she is
Can you tell me any mode by which ES. can prevent
any evil arising from his becoming a writing medium
                  No harm would come of it were it really
     4460     the friend he thinks it to be, that guided
                  his hand, but the same spirits that
                  Rap, Animate Tables & other matters guides
                  the medium's hands.
Can you tell me any exorcism by which ES could
test whether it was a wandering spirit or the spirit of
his deceased friend that guided his hand
                   It is advisable that he should use the
     4461      exorcism that you use in exorcising this
                   mirror every time that he feels an inclination
                   to take his pen.

I never had any wish to come into connexion with the
rapping spirits -- but if I could obtain raps from good
spirits I could convince sceptical person of the truth
& existence of the spiritual world.
4462 You wish to convince Dr Elliotson but
you will never be able.

I am afraid so, but there are other persons, now sceptical 
yet open to conviction.
4463 Charles Gore Onslow is a good spirit
and will have no objection to rap whenever
you wish it

have I your full permission to ask him to do so
4464 You have, but I cannot control him to 
rap at any stated time & I should be
sorry for him to frighten any one.
I should ask you to try [?] every
Tuesday evening with a wish that good
spirits only might guide your hand
merely for your satisfaction that you
might be sure that it was done by
some invisible [strikethrough hand] agent but there 
is one thing I should wish to warn 
you against, that under no possible 
circumstances Alfred Staley should try
he would immediately become a medium
& being so excitable it would overthrow his 
reason.

I will try & guard against so sad a calamity
4465 but you will not excite his curiosity so
that he will attempt writing

Certainly not
4466 It would be much better for Mr Slater
18 73
and his Medium were they to discontinue these
Spirit rappings altogether than dispute over
them, as nothing can influence good spirits
appearing as perfect harmony between the parties
and when the spirits name a particular hour
She should either tell them that she should
be engaged and could not attend to them or She
should attend when they wish, but she neglects
all this

At what hour shall I try to become a a medium on Tuesday
4467 About 9 oClock and let all those try it who
Can do so cooly and with the same earnest
desire, altho they may not prove mediums
No harm will come of it

From certain circumstances (which I mentioned) I do
not at present believe in the doctrines of the Catholic
Church, either Roman or Protestant and I wish once
more to investigate the Scriptures so far as my limited
knowledge will allow me, will you assist me in doing
so.
4468 I will do so and all the power I can exert
shall be used, in pointing out the right from
the wrong.

Doubtless many inconsistencies therein may arise from
the translation, imperfect Copies
4469 It has done so and all this I will point out
Mr. T's Guardian Spirit Semirus will appear
on Tuesday next.

Will you request Angela to appear
4470 I will
He will appear in 20 minutes
5' to 9 The CA;s gone.

Here is a spirit in white, it is getting quite dazzling
I never saw such a lovely face, the body is sideways, the
face full, wings white, from the head theres circles of
precious stones, and a white veil falling down on each
side, the arms are bare to the elbows, the face most
beautiful, a band round the waist, & with a deal of lace
about her.

Are you the GS of Mr EG
4473 I am

[EG] What are your duties as my Guardian Spirit
4474 To watch over you and protect you from all
those evils that would harm you. to keep evil 
spirits away, and when the purpose for which
you were sent on earth is fulfilled and your
spirit is prepared to face its maker, then will
I conduct you to your everlasting home.

[EG] May I hope that purpose is a good one
4475 All things are ordered for the best, and man
without a guardian spirit would be left at the 
disposal of evil ones.

[EG] And is every mortal blessed with a GS.
4476 Yes but many have an evil one as well

[EG] But has not every one an evil spirit
4477 No if they live for a good purpose they have not

[EG] May I without being too presumptuous hope that my 
20 
75
resting place or home will be a happy one.
4478 Let your ---------
Be honest, upright just and merciful
in your dealings to all mankind, remember
that ever watchful providence is looking over
You, that your slightest action can be recalled
pray and be ever mindful of your souls
salvation this done. I rest assured we shall be
forever united in another world.

EG. Is it permitted for mortals who have dwelt upon
Earth when they enter the spirit world to recognize
their Guardian Spirit
4479 Yes
Man cannot fancy a more happy state of being
than being united to all those he loved upon
Earth and being free from all cares sorrows
and anxieties -- but there is greater happiness
than this, far greater which none can describe.

EG. did you ever dwell upon this Earth or where you ever
embodied in a natural form
3 corner.
4480 That must be answered by the CA. I know
nothing of my previous state of being. If
I ever dwelt upon this earth the moment I 
became so far purified as to be a GS of any
person I lost all recollection of my former 
state of being

EG. Can you inform me if the Lady Miss C. is happy
in her present marriage
4481 I cannot do so.

Can you tell me if I am likely to have a large family

ago I showed you her marriage and [?] life. 
It has now taken place are you satisfied
Yes I am happy she is married I hope it will prove more 
favorable than I imagined.
4484
You did not believe she would be named
No I did not but I am now satisfied, I was informed 
before that Herschel was her GS. How long have you 
been her GS.
4485
Two months before her marrying, the cloud
which (formed?) over the church at the time 
of her marrying held in it the likeness of her 
future destiny.
Hes gone.

Will you please to inform us why you have favored
us with another vision
4488 If there are any visions Mr. Groom wishes to see 22
either Atmospheric or Spiritual I will show them 76
between this and then they will not appear. 
Semirus will then appear to assume his charge 
that he will protect him from all evils, but 
you will not upon any account go to Mrs. Heydons
Will you?

Most assuredly not.
4489 I am very glad to hear you say so.

How are you getting on at Chobham
I am snug in London, I bugged myself about

7 oClock in the evening and should have staid
longer if I had not had to attend a dinner party
I shall be obliged to go back again tho.

I did not ask about the color for the box
4491 Why did you not do it then.

I had a friend with me, but I will ask next Tuesday
4492 That will do well enough

I am going to try every Tuesday evening by the [nistions?]
of the CA to become a writing Medium -- have you tried
4493 No but some time ago I was told that I should 
play the guitar by spiritual aid I have 
been since trying and found it correct in some 
measure-- I was told to I should play by 
their Aid a piece from the Opera of La Sonnambula 
and certainly my friends said it was the best
I had ever played.

Robert Owen the philanthropist has written to the
Queen that he has been in communication with her dec.d
father, The Duke of Kent who states that he is in the 
4th circle, is that true.
4503 It is his Brother the late Duke of Cumberland
whose spirit is now upon earth that communicates
with him

The spirit stated he was in the 4th circle and that he is
very happy is that so.
4504 The D     of C      who communicates
with Robert Owen under the disguise of the Duke
of Kent is an evil spirit and still upon earth

I have not read any of the comm.n but Robert Owen
states them to be very interesting and of beneficial
tendency -- but your former information leads me suspect
he is in error. Will it be of any service my writing to
Mr O to test his spirits
4505 In as very short time it will be of great service

the CA left & returned
4524 OSMOND

did Osmond ever dwell on earth
4525 He was never embodied

Will Osmond be kind enough to appear this evening
4526 He will

Will he be kind enough to answer Mr G's questions
4527 I have promised & I will perform it
I will

GG. -- Is it true that all mortals have a GS.
4528 Yes it is

GG. Is that GS always a good spirit or sometimes
good & sometimes evil
4529 All mortals have a good spirit & some have 
an evil spirit attached to them.
32
GG. in what way can a person who has not the power
of seeing, decide whether his GS is good or bad.
4530 An evil spirit whether a guardian spirit
or not cannot stay while he is exorcised

GG. will prayer to God drive away an evil spirit
4531 That is exorcism.

GG by whom are GS appointed or is it left to themselves
to choose whom they will guard
4532 No answer

GG is there any objection to that question being answ.d
4533 They are appointed by the most High


GG what are the duties of a GS toward the object of
his care.
4534 To keep off evil spirits from his charge
and to prevent all those slight accidents
with which men are always surrounded
to guard them through life as much
as possible on the right path, & when
death terminates their career to usher
them into the presence of their maker
The Guardian Spirit and its charge
then become one.

GG. Is that one in affection or one is essence, so
as to be one being
4535 The angel takes ------
I cannot form my answer thy GS.
will be able to do so

GG Is it the duty of a GS to instruct his charge
in Christian doctrine
4536 When he is sleeping the GS puts good
ideas into the brain of man
33
GG is there any thing wrong in enquiring after the
state of a deceased relative
4537 There is not

GG wouldst thou have any [strikethough] objection to confirm
my faith to inform me if I have lost any distant
relative within the last two years
4538 I cannot do that unless I visit it
those spheres between this earth and
the future abode of bliss

GG wilt thou inform me at a subsequent time
4539 I will when I gain the knowledge

GG does the soul of man enter immediately after death
into perfect bliss or is it necessary some time before it does so
4540 Spirits of those mortals who died in
infancy, or those who continued idiots
all their lives go direct to bliss
But as no mortal can live upon
earth without sin, they go to the atmosphere
then enter into Hades, and in that state
they remain till they are sufficiently
purified to ascend to bliss--

While the soul of man remains in its first state
does it remember that happened to it on Earth
4541 At the first they partly remember but
as they attain happiness, they lose every
recollection of it

The CA's going
Will Osmond be please to appear

4547  You had
GG Is it permitted to Know why that GS did not
continue to be so
4548 Up to that period an Angel had guarded
you, who was not strong enough or
powerful enough to prevent Evil besetting
You
GG For how many years previous to the commencement
of thy Guardianship had he been so
4549     I do not Know.
GG Art thou always near me, watching over me
or at particular times only
4550  It is my duty as thy GS always to watch
over you and protect you as far as it is
in my power to do so from evil influences
GG In what manner may I have access to thee to
consult with thee _
35
4551 Thy atmospheric spirit consults with me
the more good and holy and free from sin
thy life is upon the earth the nearer you
approach me while living

GG but cannot I see the so as to consult thee
without the liability  to errors
4552 No answer

Can I not become a medium for seeing in the mirror
or crystal myself
4553 You cannot do that, but if it be ordained
that you should write under the direction
of a spirit I will guide your hand and 
assure you of my guardianship

GG How am I to know if it is ordained
4554 I ask you to try, it would please me if you
were to try.

GG Is there any objection to my asking questions relative
to my deceased relations
4555 No there is not

GG Is the soul of my dear mother happy at the present 
time.
4556 I will enquire & inform you on Tuesday next

GG Will thou inform me for the strengthening of my faith
in these spiritual things and thy spiritual guardianship
any particulars about my departed relative I have lost
4557 A good dear & mighty angel has undertaken
that and will inform you

May I at some future occasion be permitted to see the
At. spirit of my brother Oswald
4558 To show the vision of the atmospheric spirit
of a living person it is requisite that you
36
37
should ask the permission of the Spirit
governing the mirror or crystal.
GG Canst thou inform me whether my dear wife 
who is now absent is well, or in what part of the 
Country She is in. 

4566
Beyond my Guardianship over you 
and what I see of the world -
I cannot tell any thing happening there
I can look back but not forward
the past ascends through the atmosphere 
to Hades & Heaven, the future is obscurity

GG If at any time I feel in difficulty & want advice
& [?] a prayer to thee wilt thou kindly assist me
4567 When you find yourself in difficulty
turn your thoughts to the most High
and he will so allow me that I will 
assist thee.
He is gone 20' to 10 PM.

Requested of the CA if we might with safety allow the
spirit of Chas Gore Onslow dec.d to write by Emmas hand
4568 it is quite right
Will you all try at the same time

Yes under your promise that no evil shall befal us
4569 I will promise that.

We all four then tried but without success except
Emma who very slowly & tediously occupying nearly
an hour wrote as follows.
38
4570 " I am about to obtain everlasting
happiness -- The purity of the spirit
will be separated from its greatest curse
remembrance -- my soul will be freed
from its fetters the past will be burned
in oblivion and my immortal spirit
will wing its flight to Heaven
Make the best use of the gift that
it has pleased the almighty to confer on
you -- put no faith through life in the
promises of the great, or noble in rank
for by one of them will you be most 
------ pursue through life as
much as is possible for mortal to do a 
good and holy life---
I have seen you on earth sitting
on a counter in a small shop in 
Lambeth one little fat hand full of 
sugar plums with the other smoothing
the coat of a beautiful cat --- health

Why do you look so cross are you unwilling to have a chat
4574 It's enough to make one look cross. I am
cross with myself

Emma has become a writing medium
4575 Oh indeed, I have begun with straight strokes

And I with round ones but I don't make any progress
4576 I am afraid you are too ambitious to begin
round ones before you finish the straight
can you make the questioned tell and
answer the questions

I am going to have one made I saw a gentleman this
morning (Mr Gilkes brother in law) whose table moves for the
amusement of his children
4577 No good will come of that the table must
be animated by some spirit, good or bad I am 
quite certain that a spirit moves even the key

I was at a large party in Nice they were 
talking about the experiment but it was

hes gone

[Mars symbol] 9th Aug. 1853. 20' to 8 PM
I had as usual requested the CA to answer our questions
in the mirror & whilst engaged in arranging my
papers Emma remarked that the Crystal was very
thick & said here's reading come.
4580 Those questions that you wish answered
by the mirror and all visions you wish
to see will be shown any other evening this
week. this evening the spirits are engaged

Then I presume Semirus will not be able to appear
even if Mr PM comes
4581 He will not the writing will be the same
if you wish it as other Tuesday evenings             41
Then with your permission we will devote the evenings as
writing Mediums
4582        Answers will in that case be returned to
most questions you wish
upon sitting down to write neither Selina nor myself
developed the faculty Selina still making straight
lines and myself circular, Emma alone writing as
follows
 May I ask by whom our hands will be guided this
evening
 4583       The Crowned Angel the Dove Angel and
  Constantine
Will the C A be able to inform us what relative Mr
Gilkes has lost within the last 2 years
4584        I have not visited the spheres
Shall I ever become a writing Medium
  It will be more developed than at present
4585   but I think that it will never be intelligible
enough for you to understand
Will the Guardian Spirit of Selina guide her hand
+ develop her faculty of being a writing medium
 hereupon Emmas hand remained quite still but Selina's
hand although strongly impressed only made lines
 Emma then made a rude drawing of a Coffin + wrote
4586      do you wish to ask any more questions
feeling on my seers account rather alarmed I asked
will developing the faculty of writing mediums be
Conducive to our happiness on this earth                42
  It will in many instances on [Earth?]
in some cases it will be conducive to
your happiness - but in all great source                4587
of interest it will serve to keep your mind
on our eternal welfare and will give the
mind rest after matters of business

We were then sitting + I mentally begged the CA that
I might be warned against any thing injurious to
Emma by being a writing medium - my mind being
at the same time fixed upon a different + ever painful
subject when Emmas hand began to write (as tho'
to show how closely the sublime + the ridiculous are
joined) the following note

"dear Rc
Should you fail to come to Cheltenham
on Saturday you will greatly oblige me
by sending ten pounds, you may be well
aware that I cannot keep the house                   4588
myself + baby on two pounds per week
I hear you are making a fine show at
Chobham, I am afraid you will burn your
fingers, if the General hears it, which I
trust he will not -- believe I have been
having a very sedate life at Cheltenham
thinking of none but yourself, do come on
Saturday & if possible bring Edward with
you the baby is quite well & the image of 
its Australian papa - I said I would
43
retaliate
I remain my dear Lord
Yours most affectionately
Adelaide Powell"

Then presently Emma wrote
4589 "The letter you have just received was
intended for Mr Anderson, you will greatly
oblige him by show him, as it was 
mislaid, or ask his Atmospheric Spirit
to attend to you while you read it to him
Constantine"

[Jupiter symbol] 11 Aug. 25' to 8 PM   Japan Crystal
Called Mr Anderson
hes here in military [undress?]
Good evening, Mr. Anderson
4590 Good evening Sir.

I have received a letter from Cheltenham which I 
rather think was intended for you
4541 What was it

From Mrs Adelaide Powell -- Now he looks so cross, he
was smiling before -- do you hear what I say
4592 Yes her husband is gone to Australia
She wishes me to lend her some money
no doubt, which her husband of course will
[?]
--
her husband should have intrusted me
with more money for her
--
O she's nobody, at least nothing to me
44
4593
-- 
Yes but I am obliged to look after her
--
I don't know what you mean.

How's Colonel Bentinck is he quite recovered
4594 he's recovered sufficiently to return to London
but not to undertake his duties

how is it you did not go to Spithead to see the [Seafight?]
4595 Couldn't get leave of absence, [?] I didn't
dare ask for it, got in too many scrapes
already -- Ma- Pa- & Georgy have gone
--What did she want to see Ned for

Oh I can't say I would send you the letter if I knew your
address
4596 I'll tell you who she was if you are not in a 
hurry. About 3 years ago she was Georgina's
Lady's maid she married Powell a sad rake, a surveyor
of Roads all at once he took it into his head
to go to Australia, and I promised to take
care of his wife and child, I have indeed
acted as a guardian, and when he returns
he will be doubtless truly thankful.
--
I don't know what you are driving at, he
put some money into my hands which
I of course give her.

We were at this moment sitting on a style in the fields
leading from Woodside Green & a countryman with a bag
on his back coming up & we had to let him pass, & as he
was going from us -- Mr A said (alluding to the man)
4597 Turnips I suppose--
--
Just as we have got decent weather they
are going to break up. have you been down

No, have you tried your box mirror lately.
45
4598 No I have not had time, every evening I dine
with the officers, and stay late, and then I am 
glad to turn into quarters, and if we go 
out we all go out together.
--
Ah some of them's sad wild chaps,
Chobhams infested with women, the young
scamps  have them down from London, they'd 
get finely reprimanded if any of the head
ones hear it
Looking after them gets me into precious
presses, I was looking after them the whole
night a week or two ago in the wet & got the
toothache. I am obliged to send one of the
snappish old corporals after them, they are
never to be seen if they are wanted when they
are off duty -- 
For a fortnight I was wet through every
night -- poor fellows, we wanted some
comforters then.
--
Did you see the frogs jumping out of 
the boats in [?]

Yes and thought of you, I want to bring my Young
Friend Miss Lucy Finch into the crystal, can you bring 
her in for me
4599 O you talk about my friends you have
got some have you -- then I'll wish you 
good night

Do I ever appear in your crystal
4600 You came in on Saturday evening with a lady
who said she had pawned a gold chain.
hes gone.
46
[Mars symbol] 16th Aug.t 1853.  CA MIrror
7 PM  Invoked the CA
the CA is here.
Mr P is now here will Semirus appear agreeable to his promise
4601 I will inform him

About a year ago we saw in the crystal a vision of a shipwreck
in which a great number of diamond shaped bodies with human
heads appeared swimming about. what were they.
4602 They are spirits that always dwell in the water

Are there elementary spirits inhabiting the fire ie existing in Flame
4603 Yes

Can we without prejudice see them
4604 You can

I wish under your guidance to try to develop my seers faculty
as a writing medium
4605 You may try but I think you will not have 
much success.

Mr Slaters medium played the piano under spiritual
guidance can Selina play this inst.t by that means.
4606 I cannot tell whether her GS would play 
thro' her, any other spirit would not be advisable

Will you  please to tell me the name of her GS.
4607 OMO

Will Omo appear this evening if called
4608 he will

Can you tell me why I have not heard from E.S. lately
4609 No answer

Why cannot I get Lero to appear in the crystal I gave
Mrs H.y Lea
4610 He would appear if there was any one present
who could see him.

Mrs Lea is rapidly developing her faculty I presume
She will soon be able to do so
4611 She will never have spiritual visions
74
47
Have you any advice to give me this evening
4612 I have not

Will you please to ask Semirus to appear
25' to 8. 
4613 He will appear in half an hour
Wm Glazbrook Dresser wishes to [appear] say
something

Called to GD.
he is here as usual
4614 I am very much obliged to you for your kind
present of the mirror it answers very well indeed

will WGD be able to obtain a person to  in this mirror
4615 Yes. Sally Cook.

Miss C. is ES's seer and of course he cannot have her,
can you name some else
4616 Mrs Haydon or Mrs Roberts would see very
well.

I don't know how you manage matters in the atmospheric
spirit world but in this Mr D would have to pay fee to
either of those ladies & he could not go to them every time he
wished to consult his mirror.
4617 There are only 12 in London

I cannot contradict your assertion but as I personally know
4 or 5 I think 12 in a million an absurdity
4618 I mean that can see well enough to see all
that is called in, & also see answers to every
question. 5 people in every 30 can see it
cloudy & [stroker?]

do you know the gentleman we call Mr Anderson
4619 WHIM

Will WGD prove a writing medium
4620 I don't know

If I make an app.t for next Tuesday will you ask Almondio to appear
4621 Yes I will
73
48
Will you also appear
4622 I wont come down unless you promise to let
me take the mirror back with me, or else I shall
never get it, you are afraid I shall get ahead 
of you.

I am too vain to think that one who has known of these
occult subjects so recently, can "get ahead of me" who have 
[?] been nearly 30 years engage in it, but here is the
mirror will you take it with you
4623 I paid for a handle but I dont see it.

Here it is see, all complete
4624 What a capital warming pan it would make
with a long handle & a lid.

If you have any sensible thing to say, say it, if not depart
hes gone.

5' past 8 PM. Invoked Semirus
He is here very fair, very young in white with wings
flesh colored feathers, in a flying position I can see his
arms & sleeves.
Ex.d 3 times 4625 Semirus

Please to show &c (He showed them to Emma but she could
not make them out.

Do you still protect me from evil
4626 I do

Have you any advice to give me
4627 I have not.

May I ask why you made this appointment
4628 Unless I am called to appear occasionally
I cannot do so at all & I wish to do so to let
him bear in mind that my greatest care is
that he should continue a right path thro
this life and a blessed one hereafter

Will Mr T. become a writing medium under your guidance
49
4629 I will try but before I have tried I cannot
tell whether I shall succeed.

Will he be able to see if he looks in the mirror
4630 he will not be able to see

do you know my atmospheric spirit
4631 I know that you have an atmospheric spirit

did my AS ever apply to you
4632 Yes

Upon what subject
4633 he consults me upon subjects that you would
do if you could approach near enough.

Is my atmospheric spirit distinct from my soul
4634 Yes while life is in the body, the soul is 
there also.

do you know my friend the late Mr Edward Grantham of
Croydon.
4635 I do

Would he appear in this mirror is requested
4636 Yes but he has lost the form he appeared 
in last time.

Is he in a happier state now than he was then.
4637 Yes

Please to show &c.
4638 I
       AA

Will you explain to me what those letters mean
4639  Angel of Hades of the first degree

do you know when I am in any mental difficulties
4640 I am always near you & ready to help you
when you sincerely & mentally ---- In the 
hands of God I place these difficulties
may he enable me to surmount them.
of your own individual self you can do
nothing.

Thro whom should that prayer be made
77
50
Will you give to me in any other mirror the same answers
to questions propounded by Mr P. as the CA will give to me in
this mirror to the same questions
4641 Yes all those spirits of the same degree and
the same enlightenment entertain the same
opinion, and when from that degree they
attain a still higher one they proceed in 
wisdom.

Did you not tell me the last time you were a spirit of the
Sun.
4642 I did, but I was then "an undeveloped spirit"
to use Mr Slaters words

I do not wish you to use any words but your own, & still less
Mr Slater's who has but a very limited knowledge of these 
occult subjects
4643 That was the only word which I could
imagine would embody my idea.

Were you ever embodied on this Earth
4644 I was not.

As I and Mr P differ very materially upon some important
points of doctrine, I mean Christian doctrine, will you
answer his questions in any other mirror
4645 I will

Mr P here remarked that Semirus in mentioning our prayers
to the most High, had not alluded to Jesus Christ and
I replied that that was the reason of my making the
above questions, when Emma observed here is a great deal of 
reading come.
4646 I will, by the word Most High I mean
God the Father Almighty who is the father
of our blessed Saviour Jesus Christ, who is
the Father of the World, and also of all
mankind, and of all things which are
beneficial and good to mankind.
70
57.
Jesus Christ is the same Medium by which
prayers are made acceptable to God in the
Protestant Church as Mary is in the Roman
Catholic. Mary is a High Angel but of
[C????] nothing to be compared to our Saviour
In All religions + in all sects of Religions
there are good and bad
Man should not be so uncharitable as
to think that none but those of his own
religion should be saved hereafter. 
True religion consists in [?]
4646
I believe that Jesus Christ was sent
into the world to save sinners, of whom
All men are more or less.
[?] a wise interposition of the Father
All those to whatever sect or Religion they
may belong will be blessed hereafter and set
on the Throne with the Father if they repent
before death of the Sins they have been guilty
of in this life.
Charity is one of the greatest blessings
of Religion, men are Apt to say of those who
have died a sudden death or have been otherwise
taken away from earth without having
outwardly shown any signs of repentance that
they will not be saved hereafter, they are ready
to Extend their pity, but not their Charity.
No man can tell what is passing in the
heart of another when the Soul is passing from
the body, at the last moment it is not too
late. —
Many have sinned and one has said it
who was looked up to by many as an 
79
52
example in Christianity from the pulpit of
the Church of England shortly after the death
of Napoleon Bonaparte the late Emperor of 
France.

"I sincerely regret that he should have
passed from this life in the same
ambitious way in which he lived."
"He lived in the expectations or at least
the hopes of conquering this world &
he fully believed he had a throne 
reserved for him hereafter"

But that was not the case if ever a man truly
repented it was Napoleon Bonaparte, he saw
the vanity of human wishes, and he truly
acknowledged it broken down in spirit
and broken in heart, he was received by his
maker & is now indeed happy beyond 
human imagination.

Semirus is gone

4662 No

Can you inform me the name of Mr GG's G Spirit
4663 Osmond spirit of Hades +

Have the names of spirits any particular meaning or signif.n
4664 Yes the same as Mortals +

By what means or cause did Emma write the letter which
came from Mrs Adelaide Powell
4665 Mortals before their birth have one particular
name assigned them could it be read a right 
they would express mans destiny. happiness
or misery *

That would tend to induce the belief that man is predestined
to be either good or bad from his birth
4666 It is not so x

Then I presume his name foreshadows only his worldly prosperity
or misfortune
4667 You are right --------------------x

Will the CA please to render the last answer plainer

to improve or destroy [drawing]

Will the CA allow me to ask him to write an answer in

a proof to those who do not believe in spirit manifestations
4669 Write to [believe] convince unbelievers I will
not -- If you cannot understand it, why
write it? [drawing]

I thank you I perceive the answers thus written are in some
places erroneously spelt, as Emma would have spelt the
words -- this which happens also to others appears to me
unaccountable, will you oblige me by explaining it

10' past 9 PM
Invoked Evani
Here is the CA in white
4702 I will not stay a moment, neither will you
have any more visions this evening but I 
wish to say that all this writing that takes
place between each Tuesday evening, I cannot
guarantee that it is done by good spirits
I would advise you to ask all those
spirits who wish to write to do so on a Tuesday 
evening.

If it is your wish I of course will do so but Tuesday evenings
I wish to devote to receiving your kind advice, & our evenings are
so short.
87
60
I seldom stay with you more than an hour
4703  and certainly 3 hours would be enough for
          writing and I would much rather that you would
          confine it to a Tuesday Evening
Is our Tuesday Evenings are so short might we not confine
that to receiving your advice & have another evening for 
our other communications
4704  Taking your spiritual happiness into 
          consideration I cannot comply with your request
          could I have done so I would not have invited
          you this evening
The CA's gone.

I had just previous to this charged the the ES crystal for
Selina which became very thick, yet altho objects came
into the Crystal she could not distinguish them & her eyes
aching she left off & began to develope her writing faculty
and Emma looking to inspect the crystal (being confined
to her bed the CA mirror was too large) I charged it as above
for her in the meantime Selina kept waiting & upon
taking it up I found the following
4705 Mr Owan Londones wishes to write this evening
I am a clergyman of the Church of England
and have always took a very great interest
in the crystal and I am convinced of the
truth of it, on account of my having the
gift of seeing a number of things amongst
them was a very curious circumstance which
I should like to name which I think w.c
interest you very much
A young lady an acquaintance of
mine was looking into my crystal one evening
and saw her brother who was dead, and 
murdered he said by a friend, she was so
88
61
shocked at it that she fainted for when
She left home he was quite well, and I of
Course sent to know if it was true and I
received the mournful intelligence of the
fact.

Will you please to write your name plainer

at 8.50 pm As Edward Edwards had appointed this evening
for writing and not wishing to appear rude I asked
(Selina being medium) will Edward Edwards please to
inform me if he is now present.

4707 Yes

I am directed by my GS the CA to request all spirits
to visit me only on a Tuesday evening will it be agreeable
for you to do so next Tuesday ev.g
4708 I cannot appear next Tuesday evening
on account of my having another app.t
any other evening I should be most happy 
to write.
You must beware how you exorcise
the spirits you invoke, because evil ones
take possession of the medium and make
you believe any thing, and of course you
cannot tell about it as you cannot see
them. I hope you will not --- me intrusive

7h 25 PM Japan Crystal. Mrs Charlotte Lea Spex.
Invoked Evani
Theres the same face appeared I saw in the Green Crystal
Invoked Evani
The face has gone, it has become quite dark, its very thick
its gone quite clear.

Invoked Almondio
No vision
Invoked Lero
No vision
5' to 8 Invoked Orion
He is here only his head, nothing upon his head, a light
seems to go across his mouth. its all gone dark & theres a
great number of figures all round him like planetary figures
now theres a light come over the back of his head & over his
face.
Will you tell me your name
there is a long row of reading but I cannot make it out
now hes going very small, hes gone.
We then requested a spirit to write by one of us & Mrs
Lea developed the faculty by first making some irregular
horizontal lines & upon requesting the spirit to write his
name after several attempts it made a T--

[Jupiter sign] die 14 Sept. Ada's Crystal. (Japan)
8h.25'. Invoked the C.A.
Immediately Emma said the Crystal is full of water, its the
sea the waves are very rough, theres many black figures
in the water, theres 13 black figures very ugly, going towards
the steamer the steamer is an immense way off. theres such
number of black figures, out behind that they appear one
black mass, they are going towards the steamer, I can
90
63
see something a good way off. I cannot tell whether houses
or rocks, the sea is so dense & wavy that I cannot discern
the black figures plainly the black figures seem going along
with the waves, the steamer is coming towards me. theres
hundreds of these black figures round the steamer, I rather
think its rocks I can see the people on deck, the steamer
turns to battle so hard & the black figures are every wave
thrown against them.
Now I see another steamer going along quite
clear and no black figures about it -- there's somethings
over the steamer with the black figures -- flying over it -- those 
flying over it are white and have wings, there are 4 of them
the steamers turned now they sail towards me.
Its close against these rocks, theres so many of
those black figures around it, I can see a very dark man
on board he has moustachios or beard, he looks like a 
foreigner, a hat loose coat with large pockets, its all getting
smaller & going on one side leaving the crystal
3/4s clear

In the clear part there is an old gentleman come, theres
such a deal of writing under the white figures
4709 "The prayers of the Angels for the deliverance
of the Thames from the power of evil -- 
strengthen our arms that we may deal the
blow of death to the enemy of mankind"

Under the sea theres a black curtain come down  & on one
side some people -- its a room there is part of a fireplace
some people its very dark, they look very miserable, they
are sitting down round a fire, one is laughing & the others
look very miserable indeed & against the black curtain a
kind of a box stands, on that box theres a curly smoke like
steam goes thro the curtain & where the steam goes theres a
91
64
white figure with wings I cannot possibly describe the place
theres [a]beautiful flowers buildings birds and things & a great
many more angels.
In the vacant quarter theres something coming
now, the stout old gentleman has a silk hdf. round his
head, old fashioned great coat drab cloth trousers, he has
hair & no teeth but a very merry looking [man] face
and thick soled boots,  its an arm chair, [these] he is very
stout, there is reading under him.
4711 Sza
heres two fingers come close to him & a key and a skull
and beside it a drab kid glove, and underneath that a
face of a woman. Very white skin thin face dark hair
eyes black eyebrows the nose rather turned up.
Its all gone 5' past 9 PM.

Will the CA be pleased to inform me to what the vision
refers.
4712 The Thames is an entire abode of evil spirits
and every one who is drowned or for one
moment goes beneath the water is
impregnated with an evil spirit, some & a
few only from the excessive watchfulness
of their Guardian Spirits if they had before 
a powerful one. I mean those that are not
drowned have it discharged
I shudder at the thought of what the
Thames contains to every one who sails
upon it there are great dangers

Will you as my GS tell me if you have any objection to
my returning from Hull by water.
4713 No Guardian Spirit can put himself in
contact or otherwise influence man while he
is upon water - the space that divides them
92
65
is so great.
You have lately lost a much respected
friend he wishes to appoint an evening that
he may appear as he is at present very
unhappy.

I expect to be home in a fortnight & will then make an
appointment with your approbation
4714 It shall be so

9.30pm Called Mr. Anderson
Good eveng you are quite a stranger
4715 Good evening sir, I have seen a good deal
of trouble lately, I have been [cleared?] out of a 
good deal of property that I thought would
93
66
have fallen to my share - not that I care 
about that at all
--
O I can get my living fast enough but not
much besides tho.-- Scotlands a terrible poor
land.

Are you in attendance on Her Majesty then
4716 O no

do you do any thing as a spirit writing medium
4717 No I have been to Cheltenham, I have been
into the room that was inhabited by a ghost.

Emma & Selina are both excellent writing mediums
4718 do you think the cholera will really come to
London, have you asked any thing about
that. I am at Brighton

No for I really think very little about it
4719 Well if it makes its appearance in London
I'm off to Italy that all
--
I heard all about that, have you got that
from Headquarters.

Yes from the Queen herself. heres her handwriting.
4720 Ill soon tell you if its like her signature

Is that like it, showing him Selinas writing as a med.m
4721 No very much blacker she write different
shaped letters. I'll show you something more
like her signature --

hes gone. now he's come back with a piece of paper in his hand
and showed Emma the Queens signature which she
tried to copy.
4722 I have found one of Her Majestys real 
signatures, that is her writing only 6 months
ago

Have you had any thing fresh in our Way
4723 I have not had much time I went to 
Brighton to attend the funeral of a Lady
page 120
94
67
4723 She was nearly half drowned about 2 years
ago -- a man picked her up but I will tell you
how it was.
The summer before last her mother and
father and herself went down to Brighton &
nothing would do but she must go to bathe
the first time either she was very nervous
or the machine was out of order she was
                and down she went, she began
to roar and the consequence was she went down
twice before the man could get at her. the old
man therefore said he had saved her. and he
was a constant visitor at her house, he had a 
good deal of money and she had none, her
father encouraging him, he kept going there
and paying his addresses, however, she never
liked him, and when he made her the offer
he hinted the service he had done her, and as
she had no other way of showing her gratitude
her father hinted she ought to marry him
an ugly little wretch -- I like her rather
once -- they were married, she ever could
bear the sight of him and 2 or 3 weeks she
died, she always had a sort of sneaking
affection for me. -- here I am now.

Then she hadn't any [?] to leave you
Hows Mrs. Powell of Cheltenham
4724 I don't know. Her husband will soon
come home, and find her ably provided 
for -- but don't talk about her I am going to
be married to a very respectable Lady in about
3 weeks.
68
May I ask the Lady's name
4725 Listowell

I wish you joy with your young + beautiful Bride
4726 O as to her you thats a secondary consid.n  
no doubt she was very beautiful once 
but that was in my grandfathers time 

Is it our friend Miss Green then 
4727 I should have you calling me out if it
was her

how's the little niece got on that ran away
4728 I have not heard of her lately
No mine is to a youthful bride of 57
with a small family of 9 children

Oh he's in Paris & Mrs. Hayden I have not heard from him

for not appearing this evening on his 
next visit

Will the CA inform us which ev.g will be most agreeable 
4734 Tuesday

Will my late friend Mr Elisha Hammett appear in
the mirror on that evening
4735 he will although it would be much
better to see him first in the crystal
[so soon] his life size would not be
pleasant so soon after death.

Under whose influence is Emma now writing
4736 Evana

May we continue to write under yr guidance and
protection this evening
4737 I cannot this evening but another
better able than myself will do so.

Will that spirit kindly favor me with his name
4738 Constantine

We are indeed pleased to have you with us again
Will you write or appear in the crystal
4739 I will write, and if it so please you
answer questions so far as I may be
permitted by Divine Authority

May I ask if you are aware that Emma's deceased
sister Celia is writing now at this moment by
means of her sister Selina
4740 It is even so

Is the spirit world divided into spheres
4741 It is divided into 7 spheres
70
Do the spheres surround the earth in concentric
circles or are they states of being occupying the
same space
4742       They are Seven states of being one above
the other and each confined by a
       boundary which cannot be passed by
any [except] unless purified for it, by the
one he has left they rise above the
earth in this way
Emmas hand here made the drawing (see page    )
I thank you

Can you give me any information as to palingenesia
of plants, by which plants which have been burnt
are made to appear to revive from their warm ashes
 4743  They have been done thus and I trust
will not be done again, enlightenment in
Black Magic I am not allowed to give
because it endangers both body & soul
for no other purpose than gratifying mans
vanity, by doing those things which
if let in the hand of God would in due
Season develop themselves

Would Dr Alexander Tilloch who was born at
Glasgow on the 28 Feb 1759 & died at Islington
26 Jan 1825. a great lover of alchemy & whose Mss
collection I now possess, write by Emma one evening
4744 If the Crowned Angel wishes I can 
have no objection

— In white dress, with purple mantle under the
wings which are closed — the mouth open. I see
the teeth very beautiful — on his hands are a
great many rings, on the forefinger there is 
one very large blue ring. and one all white
the face is like marble.
4764 I am sorry that I could not appear
74

and answer last Tuesday evening
It was owning to a great Commotion 
Which is now taking place in the
Spirit world, and which I fear will last
sometime longer, it was not him and
disregard to your calling. the kept me
away as I have much very much
to say.

I ret.d thanks for the advice which saved me from
the past storm on the 24th July.

4765
You have questions which you wish me
to answer, by the time I have answered
them I shall be able to express what I 
have to say.

Can spirits see equally well without the light of our
Sun ie. do Spirits recognized any difference between
night & day. - light & darkness - as to the power
of Vision

4766
Your light and darkness only extends
to the boundary which separates Earth
from Heaven beyond that it is always
light but when Angels and Spirits visit
the earth they have a light around them
which not only guides themselves but
shows them to those that see them.

Can Angels & Spirits see through Opaque bodies, as
Walls of homes or plates of metal

4767
Spirits do not see with their Eyes, they
see with the whole being they are so
infinitely sensitive that they will
themselves into the presence of parties
they are there without passing through
walls or any substance they pass like
75
thought they do not even know themselves
how they pass

Can spirits see beneath the surface of the Earth
So as to discover [?] and treasures
4768  Evil Spirits can do so

Can you make yourselves tangibly felt by mortals
4769  They can make intense pressure upon a
party or make them feel as though a
cold hand was passed over them, but
further than that they cannot

When Emma & Selina link by your influence by
what means or method is such influence exerted
4770  No answer

We shall be happy to receive any communication
from you when you are ready, or shall I proceed
with my questions
4771  I am in an hurry to go this Evening

When a medium works under your influence, how
is it she spells incorrectly the same as in her
normal state.
4772  It is the will of the spirit that moves
the parties arm, I will you to write a
Sentence and you write if, after your
own fashion, you do not take possession
of your arm and write yourself — you stand
by and what you wish them to communicate
you will them to write.

Can you discover the diseases which affect our material
bodies
4773  I can do so if the party is first in
contact with the party that sees me

Can you tell me if I have any disease in my
system
4774  I know it
76

Is there any objection to your telling me
4775
No answer

Can you cause the soul of any deceased mortal who
once lived on Earth to appear in our crystal or mirrors
4776
I can assist in doing so, but it does not
rest with me alone. I can be the
instrument by which they are seen.

How do you know where to find the souls of those
deceased mortals whose presence we requested
4777
I apply to another who is all seeing
and he allows them to appear through me

Are there separate Angels appointed to govern or direct
each sphere
4778
There is only one body of Angels which
Continually encreases, and they all stay
in one place [thee?] highest but they can
descend into each sphere at their pleasure

Then am I to presume by that that each sphere
has not a separate Angel to preside over it.
4779
Not one that always remains, but
they acknowledge the superiority of angels
and always obey them.

In what occupations or amusements do deceased
Mortals exercise their Souls in Spiritual bodies in 
the Spheres
4780
That is a question which I have been
asked a good many times but of which
as yet I cannot comprehend the
meaning
A spirit even in his 1st stage is so
different from a mortal that I cannot
give any idea of his occupation
He does all that he wishes, and he
77
[?] has to do nothing that he knows will
not advance him towards a higher state
to him things are great [?] which
would be perfectly incomprehensible to
Man.
Do mortals when they leave this Earth carry their
religious doctrines and dogmas into the spirit world
or Roman and protestant Catholics, [?] etc. etc.
4781
There are good and bad of all sects of
religion, they all strive to do right - the
religion they are brought up in and the
religion of their forefathers they generally
continue on through life, they all aim
at the same end Eternal Happiness, if
they do so sincerely, and all strive to
do rightly they will assuredly not fail
of obtaining it-
We are at your conscience ready to receive any
communication or advice you may wish to give us.
4782
Have I answered all thou questions
you wished to put
No I have some more questions to ask but think 
[?] sent your convenience.
4783
I wish you to do so now.
Is man at present constituted  in the same condition
as when first created or has he become depressed or
fallen from any higher state of being
4784
He is the same
Have the souls of human persons ever lived before
had an anterior make of existence before then [?]
this Earth.
4785 
There has been a few [?]
The spirit of Joseph Balsamo [?]
to the Earth three times
78
Can you tell me in what year he first appeared
and under what name
1218
4786 Edward Grantley xxxxxxxx T[?]
He first appeared in 1218 his name
was Edward Grantley
Can you tell me when he next appeared
4787 I cannot now, but I will on my next
visit
Shall we be able to see my late esteemed friend
Elisha Sla[?] this evening
4788 If next Tuesday will do as well I
should prefer[?] it
Can you tell me the [lawn?] that from my distant
childhood I have had so strong a person for my [?]
[?] magical and other occult studies.
4789 No answer.
When the soul spent of any deceased mortal wishes 
to work by one of us as mediums will you please
to tell us how we ought to act to ascertain if they
are good and truthful [?] of mercy
4790 None can write without my knowledge
if you can so far trust me I will
answer for it none shall appear or
write excepting those who are good,
those who are very good, and in a state of happiness answer
4791 [?] by good I mean those who are
developing themselves and will [?ably]
reach the 7 Sphere.
We shall be most happy to be so far under
your protection, can you write or cause some other 
spirit to write by my hand as I much wish to
become a [?] medium.
79
4792 [?] and it will in time [?]
I would much rather that you confined it
to Tuesday nights
I will do so, can I do so on Tuesday nights after I am
in bed
4793 Much better go to sleep and rest your mind
Are the souls of men and women in the spheres
[?] together as man and wife
4794 Will you ask me that question next
Tuesday evening
Last Tuesday a spirit wrote by Selina who stated
herself to be the living Queen of England. May I ask
you for an explanation
4795 It was her atmospheric spirit that did it 
but no dependence is to be placed upon
what they say of any party. - as the
spirits, in the body do not know what
the atmospheric spirits say, but very often
and nearly always the atmospheric spirits will tell 
you rightly of a persons thoughts and [?]
when he himself wishes to [?] them.
Can you tell one of P.A. invokes by the crystal
4796 I do not know P.
Have you the power to make yourself visible if you
[?] to [?] being mortal
4797 No answer.
Last Tuesday evening Emma by Evans' guidance
drew a diagram of the spheres which not being so
plain as I could wish, will you allow her to throw
it over again plainer
4798 I will
[?] any advice etc.
4799 There has been and I fear there will be for
80
Some time longer a great commotion in 
the atmosphere and which as soon as it
is over I will tell you what it was, but
during the time that it continues, the 
services of most if not all of the At[mospheri]c
Spirits -- spirits of the planets and the
angelical spirits -----------
Will you refrain from calling
any of these tomorrow night or divining
this week, next Tuesday I promise
you as many as you please shall appear,
tomorrow night I particularly
wish none should be evoked
Mrs. Lea will never become a seer
unless the guardian spirit of a person
who has the gift perfect takes the 
guardianship of her, and her guardian
spirit takes the gift off her, then the
gift may be transferred, if you are 
willing to do this [then the gift may 
be transferred]. She would then become
a perfect seer, but I do not by any 
means wish it.

x I explained-
Shall I be able to make Mrs. Lea a writing medium
x4800 Yes if you choose to try
Certainly I only mentioned it as being
the only way of her being able to see
Then you will not invoke or call any
spirit to write before next Tuesday

Certainly not
As my seer is not very well & sees imperfectly be
pleased to render the reading as distinct as possible
81
Many persons friends of yours have been
present at your interviews with me,  I regret 
to say that some of them, have not believed 
at all because I did not give some proof 
of my presence, and one has concluded
that it is the work of evil spirits, It is
painful to me who has no other object 
in appearing than instructing enlightening 
and encreasing in happiness those to
whom I appear and those who are 
present, to think that in any way it
is doubted, I cannot but wish to make 
them believe in my presence in what
way can I do so,, can I give them an
unmistakable sign without in any way [?]
them

It would be a great satisfaction to me if you could do
So I think[ing] by lifting a sheet of paper or any
article from one table to another would be a 
sufficient proof
4802 That would be sufficient so far so to
testify to my presence, who then would 
say I was not evil, as evil spirits have 
greater power than good, perhaps you
will consider of it against my next
meeting x xx at the same time I
cannot repress my admiration at the 
conduct of Mr Fill & Mr Gilkes they
had not known about them before but they
came open to connection without flying at
the end and believing at once before they
know any thing about it, they considered
& weighed it well in their mind.
xx   xxx
82
I cannot do more than promise them
that whenever they come I will do all 
in my power to instruct and enlighten them
and I shall always be most happy to
give them any instruction in my power
I have now appeared for a great many
times - if in that time I have said
any thing or given you any advice [?]
wrongly or unduly so that might in any
way wound your feelings or make [?]
any claim in your mind as to the safety
or happiness of my one belonging to you
who is dead. I sincerely respect that
what I have said believe me is sincere and 
well meaning.
Have I done so
I explained
4803 As I shall not  see you again before you
have completed one more year in this
world of love and strife, which is yet not
without its pleasures to those who are [?]
in it. I entreat you to accept my most
fervent prayers for your health and
happiness may you live long and [?]
Many [?] each [?] one be
brighter than the one before it which
has passed away xx
and should you think with me that xxxx
at the same time let me assure you
that I shall always do the best in my 
power to preserve you from all evil with
spiritual and bodily by giving you
timely warning of any thing that will
83
happen to do you evil
So would have had a great deal more to
say had it not been so late but as I
am afraid there is not time I will come back
by saying, that one of the greatest men of
his age, indeed the greatest man of his
age and one of the greatest since the
world was created, will appear when you
have time to [?] him, he wishes to
vindicate himself as much as possible
from the injury and [?] which was
imparted to him in the world and I have
no doubt you will hear him with great
interest- It is Napoleon Buonaparte
the late Emperor of France.
The CA came and went up through the top of the mirror
10h30pm - being? unnamed? in the mirror 2 3/4 hrs
20 1/0 11 Japan Crystal
4804 Called Mr. Anderson
He cannot appear this evening 
Action [?]
During the time Emma was engaged inspecting
the mirror- Selina [M?] a working medium
The following
4805 A spirit named Ms. Mary Matthews
wishes to write.
"I am the wife of Alfred Matthews of
[Leighton? - Buzzard?] and have been two
years my husband is very unkind to me
84
and will not allow me to have any of
my friends to stay with me, he says you
know him very well, but you never knew
me, I came from Dunstable my father
is a watch maker in that place, his
name is Mr. John Smithers, I am only
21 years of age and have one little boy.
Then the following
4806 My dear Miss [Seigh?]
As it is so long since I heard
from you I thought I would write to
know the reason, I thought you would
not have forgotten your old friend [?]
[?]. I am now living at [?]
in America, I [?] out about 3 years
ago as governess my father is dead
I often think of you my love and I
could not bear Chelsea after you left.
Lucy Cotes? wishes you to write to her
direct to her Miss Cotes 2 North Street 
[?] America
Then
[Lord Byron wishes to write a poem]
[Hark my angel see what a]
[beautiful Harmony has]
4807 Mr Anderson wishes Mr Hockley
to call him in the Crystal this evening
for he has got something to say to him
very particular can? be to do.
I said yes but when I called him (page  ) at 20' to 11 I
was informed he could not appear.
85
[Mars symbol] 18 Oct 1853 6. 30 PM.
Invoked the CA
The CA is here most magnificently dressed, the mantle
entirely composed of pearls on a ground of silver and
a diamond head dress, the robe is very like it only
plainer -- wings. There is reading under the CA
but I cannot make it out
Last Tuesday you mentioned that if it had not been
to late you had something to say. Can we receive
it now.
4808 Yet it will be so in 3 years
The first will be H
The second  C
The third R
but from the remarkable likeness it will
[be] be discovered

May I ask to what this communication alludes
Emma said Now theres a great deal of writing come
very close theres 10 lines but its not English or like
any thing I know
4809 I believe it to have been asked mentally

In what language was that question asked
4810 HINDOST----

Can you tell me the question in English
4811 I cannot make it plainer

May I ask if you know my name
4812 I know you but I do not know your
name

Are you my GS.
4813 I am

At this moment 5' past 7 a friend (S) knocked at the
door & altho I was only engaged three minutes the CA
vanished
86
1/4 past 7.  Invoked Evani.
Evani is here as before, as the Dove on the marble stand
I hope the CA is not offended at my leaving so abruptly
4814 He was not offended because he knew you could
not help it.
The CA will appear at 8 oclock

8 P.M.  Invoked the C.A.
Now theres 2 figures come, one is the C. A. the other a
white figure - quite a mist
Is that my late friend Elisha Hammet
4815 It is
I wish if it were possible that I could appear
in the presence of my wife, to give her consolation 
and advice

For consolation she must turn where only it can be obtained, any
advice you may wish I will communicate to her.
4816 The advice I can only communicate to herself

Are you happier now than when you last appeared
4817 I am encreasiing in happiness daily and I
am gradually losing my recollection of
 things which occurred  to me in life.
The moment the Soul left the Body. 
I recollected every action however minute
in my life - every word that I had spoken
passed through my [life] mind and the
time seemed as nothing between my birth
and my death.

Have you met in the Spirit World your late friend
& Landlord John Palmer of Donney Court
4818  I have  he is the same style as myself
8.25 Elisha Hammett is gone&  the CA is there
alone.
87
Will you ask any friend of Mr G Gilkes who has died
within the last 2 years to write this evening by one of our
mediums
4819 I will try and find them but as I am
perfectly ignorant of his having lost any
and if so in what sphere they are to be found
I cannot do so at present, I will as soon as
possible
Some other evening

May I ask if you are acquainted with the writings
known by Christians of all Sects as the Bible or Holy
Scriptures--ie the Old Testament.
4820 I am thoroughly acquainted with both Old
& New. -- I have promised you that I would
enable you to clearly understand them.
you told me that with my help you
intended to read the Bible through. I am
ready and willing with my help to make 
clear any passage you cannot understand

GG., do the spirits of deceased persons look forward to
any particular time of judgment.
4821 They do

 GG. will the judgment that is to take place be a general
judgment or a judgment of individuals only
4822 An open judgment in which every individual
will be judged according to their several
merits

In the New Testament the Apostle Paul & other apostles
hold up the 2nd coming of our Lord J.C. as a subject of
hope and great desire, do the spirits of deceased persons
have that [hope] object as a subject of hope & desire
4823 It does not mean that Jesus Christ will
appear actually on Earth as he did but at
88
the Judgment day when the earth and
all the planets are destroyed & pass away
& he shall sit on the right hand of the
father almighty.

Here Emmas vision was very slow and indistinct and I
was obliged almost every sentence to request to have it made
plainer & she could not see the end of this answer & 
[?] requested it might be made plainer
4824 If it were possible to make the writing
plainer I should have done so at first

do you know when Emma my seer cannot see plain
4825 I cannot, my answers are always the 
same.

GG read
May I request an explanation
4826 He did not leave the earth & ascend into 
Heaven as a man, when he made his
ascent into Heaven he was in the form
of an angel, and as an angel he will
come again, he will come before the view
of men as they will be then, not bodily
for all will be changed
He will come before the eyes of men
not amongst them

Are you cognizant of the Doctrines believed in by the
Mohammedans-- contained in their Koran.
4827 I am
Some parts of the Koran may be relied
upon as nearly as good as the Bible
Some part is objectionable
The chief part is Wrong.

May I ask how they were revealed, that is by what means
Mahomet became possessed of the writings he promulgated
89
4828 In a dark cavern he had natural visions
of Spirits without invokation
He states the Angel Gabriel gives most of the Communications
Is the name Gabriel - the name of an Order of Spirits
or of one spirit
4829 The Angel Gabriel appeared before the
Birth of Christ
There was another a female spirit of
that name not so high but of more
knowledge that appeared to him.
[?] wishes to know if his GS will appear this evening
4830 I will leave and he will appear
9h15PM Invoked Osmond
He is here, all white, white wings and dress
Will you show etc.
4831 I
AA
Please to tell me your name 
4832 Osmond
Are you the GS of Mr. G. G.
4833 I am
GG? as several weeks have elapsed since I was here
I should like to ask if you have any Command to
give me upon my subject
4834 I have not
Art thou acquainted with what takes place daily in my
family - on Several Occupations - 
4835 Only with yourself
has another spirit the guardianship of my wife
4836 Yes
Cannot thou inform me the name of that spirit
4837 I will [?] and do so
90
Is thy knowledge of my affairs limited to myself
does it extend to my friends and connections
4838 It is limited to yourself only
Will thou kindly exercise peculiar care over me for the
next 3 months, I have reasons for asking this
4839 I know, and have intended to do so
I am in some perplexity about a person in Brussels canst
thou give me some advice as to what course I should take
[?] is giving

Friday night I was coming out of the club
in St. James' Street, heard a terrible row a
little way down, it was between 12 and 1 o clock
I saw several people coming and stoop up
on one side to let the people pass, but
found it to be a couple of policemen leading
a woman to the station house as drunk
and disorderly and who should it be but Mrs.
Powell. I haven't heard of since and don't
mean to it.
May I ask you a question Mr. A seriously
4843 If you think I have not been telling the
truth, it would be [?]

Selina had commenced as a writing medium invoke as follows
4856 "A spirit names Lord Stanhope wishes to write.
I have arrived in Portugal, and am very
93
4857 much engaged with spirit rapping it is
very much practiced here, on last Tuesday
evening you told me you wanted to write
to me to tell me how very rapidly you were
getting on with your writing for it appears
your seer has become an excellent one.
I will write to you very soon.
Then-
A spirit named Lord Mahon? wishes to
write to ask Mr. Hockley a few questions

4858 Lord Stanhope my Father is a great
believer in the occult sciences and has a 
great yearning after the spirit rapping
Can you persuade him to give it up, for
I know it hurts him both n mind
and body. he is now gone to Portugal
for the purpose of finding out something
fresh about it I suppose. he told me
he was going for the benefit of his health
but I don't believe him, has he not
been down to Croyden to see you on this

Invoked the C.A.
Upon invoking [?] children  very small but very lovely

[illegible?] and after waiting an hour the C A left and
95
Invoked Evain but we had no vision, Emma
then sat down to write as a Medium but her hand
remained perfectly still

and driness of the eyes all day
There then appeared in the mirror, a pathway and 2 white
pillars a path on each side of the pillars, then 3 large
white birds with their wings open, much larger birds
than Evani- I see a figure coming near the gate

the outlines feet, arms, dress quite plain, its getting
plainer the hair is turned straight back, its getting

How are you getting on in Arabia
4881 I am getting on very well and am now

How far is that from Mecca, Medina, or Aden
4882 About 300 miles, London is Small
compared to it. Its a great place for
these sort of things, how are you getting
on you are very tiresome to me sometimes
4883 Can you tell me the Latitude and Longitude of the place
Oh yes by a great deal of trouble
It would take more time than I can spare
now, on next Tuesday Evening I shall have
more time, for I am now engaged with a
Lady and you are well aware it is not very
pleasant to be detained when such is the
case. So you will excuse
Pray what is the young lady's name

Selina as Writing Medium
Invoked the CA
Can we with safety write this Evening

[Mars symbol] Nov 22.   7 PM.   CA Mirror
Invoked the CA
The CA appeared in white with wings & crown with a
black     with the long ends hanging down to the
Bottom of the dress with a silver band all round the
black.
When will it be convenient for Napoleon to appear as
promised
4885
he will appear when Called
Do you wish Mr P. or Mr G to be present
4886
No
I have been rewriting the Visions Seen in the Crystal
and about 12 months ago several Spirits, Hunder
Low Orion + others said "I hated Emma." Can you
tell me what they alluded to
4887
No answer
Are the white black + colored races of Men all descended
from the same Stock & origin
4888
They are.
It is believed by many that the Millenium as
[88]
99
Predicted in Scripture is now on the eve of its Commt.
Is that so
4889 It is that has caused so great a commtn
in the atmosphere.
You were pleased to tell me You wd. give me the reason
of your not wishing to be called some few weeks since
Is it agreeable for you to do so now
4890 We were receiving spirits from different
planets, some who have remained in
the planets for a great length of period
have passed through the atmosphere
and have entered the spheres
The moon & the Sun have delivered
up a great number, a great many evil
spirits have left the Earth, a great
many wandering spirits have been sent
with Orion into Jupiter. The Guardian
Spirits of a great many
Some Spirits of a higher order has the
guardianship of several persons.
Do the spirits of mortals who die on this earth go to
[Mars symbol] or [Mercury symbol]
4891 They do
Can you give me any idea that I can understand
according to our Measure of Space how far the
spirit atmosphere extends and the extent of the
[?] & 2nd Sphere & so on.
4892 I have no idea of space
Can you tell me why we have such silly correspondce.
[?] means of the atmospheric spirits
4893 I cannot control the atmospheric spirits
of living persons
100
May I ask if you appeared to Mrs. Charlotte Lea in the 
Green Crystal
4894 I did not I dislike the green crystal very much
I do not like appearing unless some one is
present who can see me and understanding the
reading then of course I should have no objn.

Can you tell me the meaning of Scripture calling spirits
Thrones Powers Dominations Principalities &c.
4895 (The answer came but Emma could not see it [very]
to decipher it)

May I request the ansr. to be made plainer
4896 The answers of those questions which you 
cannot see plainly may be deferred to
another evening, other questions may be tried
as the answers to them may be legible

Last year a spirit who called itself the NL of my seer Emma
appeared & gave us very valuable infn. Did she do that by
her own knowledge or was it the spirit of the crystal that ansd.
4897 By her own knowledge, by accompanying
Constantine thro' the atmosphere & mingling with
spirits who visit the atmosphere.

Why may I ask did not my own A.S. give me any rational
answer or information was he unable
4898 No, he could have given you as much infn.
as he chose

Will you cause him to appear some evening & conduct himself
rationally
4989 he shall do so

You kindly expressed a wish to prove to Mr Pill and Mr Gilkes
your reliable apparition by some means, we in our finite &
corporeal state propose a test. Which is perhaps opposed to
the spirit world laws. - as taking paper off of the table or out
of their hands, but I think if you were to answer their
101
Mental questions, it would assuredly prove it - can you do so
to them as you have to me.
4899 I must know them more, I must mingle 
with them before I can see their mind at first
they appear to me veiled, partly hid by their 
Corporeal being, but so that reserve lessens
there's a link formed between us and we are
invited, I can reveal more to them & consequently
know more.
Can Semirus or Osmond their respective GS do so
4900 I will ask them
Mr P. & Mr. G. are those whom I most desire to convince
4901 They shall be convinced, but not in that way
I perceive Mr. Owen still believes it to be the spirit of the late
D. of Kent who raps to his questions, I have not written to him
on the subject - deferring doing so will you give me leave
4902 As Mr. Owen has not much longer to live on
this Earth it would be advisable that you write
soon. It would be advisable for you to write
to him as soon as possible after the 8th of Dec.
Is there information on that subject you wish to favor me with
4903 I will tell you before that time
As to Mr Dresser
4904 I have not
As to the Palingenesia
4905 It cannot be done, it has been done but not
in that way
I will tell you how it is done
I should be very sorry to see you perform it
Where it only Chymical Experiment there
could be no possible sin in that
Next Tuesday evening I will tell you how
it is done, and also what you shall say to
102
Mr Owen on that evening on any other evg.
excepting that one when Mr. Dresser or any
other gentn. is present that you wish.

On the 11h Oct. you informed me that Count Cagliostro
had been thrice on earth., when did he first appear
4906  First as Edward Grantley Friar of [Telbon?]
   He next lived in 1500.
As my sees tonight indistinctly may I again ask
that question at a future time
4907   I will
My seer seeing so imperfectly we ended action 25' to 9

1/4 to 9 PM Japan Crystal
      Called Mr Anderson
He is here in plain black clothes,   a great coat on
Good Evg. Mr Anderson  I hope you are well
4908 I am very well thank you
Have you met with any thing new in the Spirit World
4909 I have not long returned from Scotland
Have you any Idea whether Prince Albert has got a crystal
4910 he has one among his collection of [crystals]
minerals but he does not use it as a divining
Crystal at least not that I am aware of
Selina wishes to know if you married the old lady you
told us about, after all.
4911 No, I didn't marry her now dont mention it
hope you are satisfied Miss 
Prince Albert knows the crystal was used
by the antients, but he would not have the
slightest idea of invoking it for the purpose
of divining
Many persons of high Rank, as Earl Stanhope, the
Marchioness of Camden, the Countess of [Zesland?] possess
crystals.
There is no Charlotte street Berkeley Square
+ 15 Charles St Berkeley Square is
Sen Sir John Stanbery K.L.H. -

4912 Yes I know that but they are people
that very seldom visit long
Do you know if Elizabeth [Squinnell?] is dead or alive
4913 She is dead
Do you know when she died
4914 Sometime in the beginning of Autumn I
think - The early part of Septr.
I think I'm not sure though
I hear[e] the Queen of Portugals dead
4915 Good job too
How's worthy Father Jeremiah
Have you got [zeno?] now
4916 Why,
15 Charlotte St Berkeley Square, he's dining
at it all day long
Do you mean W H as we call him
There he's looked round & laughed at you
4917 I know people don't generally guess
what they know
Have you been down to Brighton by the 5 PM train lately
4918 No I've not, I don't generally travel
in the dark that way, go down the other
way for 2 or 3 hours
How's Mrs. Powell
4919 Don't know, seen nothing of her lately
How's Miss Green and her 2 nieces
4920 They are at Berwick upon Tweed, the
old lady thinks she won't trust them

Did one of them run away
4921 Yes
Has she taken her back then
4922 Oh yes they found out where she was

You are not very chatty this evening is it the cold

Do I ever appear in your crystal and [?] you [?]
4926 No never, do I
No.
4927 My sisters [?] a knife in her knee
I am very sorry indeed to hear that
May I ask you a question seriously
4928 Well
Are you aware that you formerly used to visit us in the
Crystal as at the present and also 12 years later
4929 No did I
Yes we have often seen you as of 1864 [?] your [?] it
Whiskers slightly tinged with [?]
4930 I had not the slightest idea of it then
Do you remember relating to me the singular apparition
You saw in [Germany?]
4931 Yes certainly I do, I related that to you
when you appeared in my Crystal
Do you remember telling me if your vision of Lady [?]
4932 Certainly I do.
We have seen you several times in company with your son
I heard a very curious and interesting [?] between you.
4933 Yes I am partly aware of that
Not my son if you please
Yes your son, he called you "Pa" and that was as of 1864.
4934 The child that was speaking to me and
looking into the Crystal with me one
evening when I saw you was Mrs. Powells
There is a Queens Road —  - St. John's Wood &
Queens Terrace       DO
105
The child I allude to is is a child of yours, about 6 years old in 
1864 & consequently will not be born this 6 years nearly.
4935  I don't know  any thing about that.
Adelaide Powell is a very beautiful Child

It is indeed strange how we have a vision of you & your
Son in 1864. 
4936   I dont understand how you can have done
So.  do you.

No, that made me ask you the question, have you any
friend now of the name of Hamilton
4937  I know a Gentlemen of that name.

Is he tall & very light har
4938 No he's carrotty, or rather yellow hair

Has that Mr Hamilton got a brother.  
4939 Yes
This one is an officer in the Army. I have
only met him 3 times in Berkley Square &
then it was at a large party, and I had
not much opportunity of seeing him, the 
Brother's name is George Hamilton

do you know where Lady [Lerslace] was when she died. 
(Now hes buttoned his coat & playing with his watch chain
What time is it with you?

St. Johns Wood

Where abouts is Charlotte St Berkley Square
4942 I suppose you have got Directory haven't you
106
Yes but why can't you tell me 
4943 it leaves out of the Square -- strange that
I have seen you there & yet you dont
know the place

I never was in any house near Berkeley Square
4944 I shall be there on Friday evening the
whole of the evening.

Is it a club house or gaming house
4945 I am certain I saw Lord Stanley there

But what has Lord Stanley got to do with Fred Hockley.
4946 Then what have I got to do with Mr 
Anderson, You call yourself Mr Hockley
and I am bound to take it so, but there
is really a most wonderful likeness, I
suppose I may wish you good evening
now.

do you remember seeing me putting up a Bedstead
do you think Lord Stanley would do that eh.
4947 He wouldnt have done it if he had been 
at home, I don't know where else he
might have been
Good evening
he's gone. 1/4 to 10

4948 Called W.H.
"Mr Hamilton cannot appear this evening"
Selina took the crystal which became clouded & she saw
a black spot come, then another & then a head, & handing
it to Emma, it proved to be Mr Anderson

I will go and fetch young Powell. You 
will see if its like the Gentleman you
mentioned.

I think the boy is very like the Pa
4954 Mrs. P. Where did you see him Mr. Hockley
Often in my crystal
4955 Mrs. P. I am sure the boy's not like his father
for he is very fair
Well I think he's very like his Pa. Mr. A
Mr. A
4956 Lord bless me, if you think its mine
I am not ashamed of it, I don't wish
to contradict you about it.
We shant quarrel, perhaps you are only
jealous, I wonder when Powell will be
back or whether he ever will be back

May I &c.
4957 I will answer your questions
You were kind enough to say you will tell me what to say
to Mr. Owen
4958 I wish you to ask him if it would be
agreeable for him to appoint an interview
with you
You might tell him more than you will
be able to do in writing
If he should appoint any other evening than a Tuesday
will you kindly appear
4959 I would do so
Can you furnish me with my proof that I might give 
him, that my writing to him is the result of spiritual
advice
4960 I cannot do that because I cannot mix
with evil spirits
May I ask what you wish to be the tenor of my letter
4961 Ask him to try exorcism on those spirits 
who call themselves the Duke of Kent and
Benjn Franklin.
Tell him that you have written by
my wish and that his system of the
Elevation of Society will never take place
------------- in England but it will
do so in America. Should he survive
the 8th of next June he will live to see
the time when America prospers under
his Social System of Education

the formula & spiritual signs names &c
for performing the palingesia of plants but

the bid of evil spirits. I of course cannot
insert it here = See my.

my papers, may I ask if you have also a seal.
4962 I have

May I ask you to give it me that I may have it engraved
upon what metal should it be engraven
4963 Silver would be best

Is there any name I should have put on the other side
4964 There is not

Is there any particular time on which it should be
engraven.
4965 No

I have for 12 years worn this Talisman [Jupiter symbol] When I get
yours engraved shall I continue to wear it.
4966 Yes continue to wear that for it is of great
service

Shall I have one engraved for my seer or will you give her one
4967 Your having one will be quite sufficient

Emma here requested the room to be darkened and upon
putting out the candles the mirror (to her) became
dazzlingly bright and behind the CA she perceived
a great number of spirits passing backwards & forwards
and even through each other, a spirit appearing to go 
completely through another & appear on the other side
Will it be convenient for us to see Napoleon

4969 Napoleon

The CA informed me you would appear one evening to
vindicate your character from the aspersions thrown
upon it -- is it agreeable to you now to do so.
Here a great quantity of reading came apparently
in his autograph -- which remained quite unreadable
by my seer she could not make out one word altho'

Selina then took the crystal and a dark object came

in close under the silver rim at the top but she could not
discern what it was, upon handing it to Emma the Crystal
remained to her quite clear & upon Selina taking it she
found the object gone, afterwards some black spots
came in great numbers but Selina could not make
them out.
After some time Selina saw a lady in a
large black mantle light bonnet and very light dress
and someone with her- Selina saw the back of the

Invoked the C.A.
I made some time since a mirror as near as I could

4971 Yes
When used will it be best for me to call on you First
for a vision

Why do angels and spirits appear with wings as
being immaterial they appear useless
4973 The different bands of angels are known by
their wings
Those spirits who are not angels have no
wings
I will take an early opportunity of availing myself of
your promise to explain the scriptures to me
4974 There are very many parts I wish to explain
In Genesis it is stated that the world was created
in 6 days - to what period of time or duration do those
days allude
4975 From Sunrise until Sunset
At what period did those [?] animals whose fossil remains 
we now call Mastodon Megatherium
112
exist did they live before Adam
4976 They did they existed before the earth was
made. The world was only made shapeable
and fit for habitation ----------------- it existed
before then in a very different shape and manner
There animals existed when it was in that
state ---------
But when Creation began and the world
was made out of an unshapeable mass
these animals were removed with the earth
and have so remained until discovered by
mortals
But these Mastodons and other monsters must have had
land and earth to walk upon.
4977 There was hard Earth, rocks water but no
vegetation then food consisted of smaller
animals & young -----
But we find such vast traces of vegetable matter which
must have existed many thousand years past. At our
coalfields, fossil ferns palms & pine.
4978 Vegetation began with mankind
Did all mankind spring from one pair
4979 That question has been answered before
In place the celebrated astronomer raised an hypothesis
that this earth had first existed in a gaseous state
at an immense orbit and that as it assumed a more spherical
form & became more solid, its orbit became as at present
nearly circular - was that so
4980 No it was not
Was the present sun moon etc. created at the same time
as mankind
4981 The moon & stars have been created [?]
considerable time time & were fixed at the creation 
of the world
Does the [Sun symbol] revolve round the Earth or the [Earth symbol] round the [Sun symbol]
4982 The Earth revolves round the sun
As so many vain hypotheses have been raised by mortals
can you tell me if the Earth is void or solid at the centre
113
4983 Stone 
Are there any other planets besides [symbols for Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars] the asteroids
[symbols for Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune]
4984 Yes there one undiscovered beyond their orbits.

This has been a widespread belief that the destinies of 
mortals are prefigured by the planetary Aspects at Birth
is that so.
4985 Yes it is

Is there any Sin in practising Astrology.
4986 There is not the least.
The only danger that exists is in using
Magic that requires the aid, or brings
you in any way to desire the assistance & 
power of Evil Spirits

Can you inform me if Mr W Cox whose letters I now hold
in my hand is alive
4987 I cannot

Can you tell me if the fixed stars we see are merely
stars -- or if they are Suns of other systems similar
to our own.
4988 They are fixed stars mostly inhabited by 
spirits.

Is the Sun which we see from this Earth the centre of
the whole system or does our Solar System revolve round
Some central Sun. 
4989 This is the only world and that is the 
only Sun, the whole of the Stars are
Numbered, and that number Surrounds
this world.
Beyond that is the 6th & 7th sphere

Can you tell me the relative size of that as yet
undiscovered planet which lies next beyond the Orbit
of [Neptune symbol]
4990 It is nearest in size to [Mars symbol]

huge most beautifully with a gentleman and in
buckskin breeches &  great boots up above the knees
and open behind - with light colored coat [?]
with gold across [?], a [??] hat
with feathers all round it, little white feathers round
the black hat - a very fine skin. - sandy [?] whiskers
& moustache [?], and very light hair, [?] hues [?]
gentleman in the same style only buff colored boots
& gloves, and the boots hung about the legs, [?]
fit [?] light, and only a single feather. and a laced
collar around his lined coat - [?] down, a great deal of
gold.
Now the first one has fringed [?] round and
he has got a white band across which goes under
his [?] .--
Theres 5 or 6 Gentlemen riding behind
They are all in dark brown coats.  It seems like paper
lace round his neck - the horses are black, gray
some white but no so white as the first ones.  They
are riding so fast [?] go so slow.  Theres  [?] another
party [?]  Keeps away from this party, [?]  are dressed
different  They are mostly on black horses 3 are on
115
brown horses, they have hats like the others but no
feathers & red frocks girdled round the middle that
dont reach the knees. they have all buff colored
boots & spurs they are dressed something like the
Wardens in the Tower only the boots.

They are going straight out, now theres
lots of trees come, such beautiful clumps of Trees
& roads between and the ground has changed to green
its all green only in some places rugged, it looks
like a forest here and there are trees lying on the ground
-- it looks so pretty -- I can see under the other
Trees another party -- They are a lot of people
on horseback, they are so small I cant distinguish
them --

Now the others have joined them, they
have turned round and all coming back together they
are getting nearer. they are laughing & seem so
gay, I think one is a Lady - the Gentleman thats
coming back is on one side, there are 3 by themselves
coming first, I think the middle one's a Lady theres
double the number behind to what went. they are
dressed so gay now they are coming nearer it is a 
lady and she has a hat on, theres a good many
ladies behind--

The lady has a black hat turned up on
both sides and one large white feather tipped with
pink, she has a claret colored velvet habit on
which almost touches the ground, a velvet saddle cloth
her riding habit opens all the way down the front
and a dress that looks like white kid, and gloves
up to the elbow, theres a long white veil hangs behind
the hat--

The horses come back much slower the
Gentleman on the other side seems only about 18
no beard nor whiskers, such a careless looking fellow
the Lady's shoes are white -- theres two on foot, one
one on each side the gentleman they are dressed like
those on horseback only they are slighter & younger
& have a great deal of gold about them, both the
gentlemen have Swords

The very young one look's like a boy the Ladies
and gentlemen behind laugh so much & are so merry
The lady in front dont laugh much, she is a curious
looking woman, her hair is turned right up under
her hat She has very large earrings blue eyes but 
very black eyebrows very dark skin, grey eyes, very
beautiful teeth & nice upper lip but the lower lip is
very thick, and so is the Gentleman's lip with the
whiskers -- very thick. Theres a great likeness only
one is fair, the other dark.. Their eyes & mouths are 
very much alike --

The young one looks so careless & good
humored -- he rides on a little distance & then pulls
up and turns round & says something, and the
others laugh at him -- and he's up to all sorts of
antics with one of the dogs, seeing how high the 
dog can jump to the end of his whip -- the light
makes his dress a beautiful color.

Now I am losing sight of the first ones
they are going out, they are gone dear me what a 
lot of Ladies & Gentlemen 2 and 3 -- & 3. & then a lot
and now there a great many on foot in amongst
them, and behind all these I see at a distance
about as many more, -- now they are all gone
its still light --

Now all the Green's changed into boards
like oak boards of a floor, I can see the seams all
across where the boards join now its coming quite
square and round the sides are horns of dead stags
& animals laying crossway & bows & arrows. and right
at the further end theres a Stand and a coat of arms
116
and on each side 2 flags crossed and above that
a flat sideboard, and on the top of that something
like a beautiful gold chased cup, its a vase and
two swords on each side crossed, and on the wall
at the back theres a stags horns and the front of
its head -- and on each side of the stags head are
like steel gloves with little bars of steel and on
the side 4 helmets very different shaped. 2 on each
side and coming upon each side is a window &
very nice curtains, they are deep windows with
crimson seats in them little tiny pa[i]nes of glass
and between the windows theres beautiful tapestry
The tapestry is in 4 sections & different views in
each theres so many things I cant tell you what
they all are -- Now theres come a long table down
the centre -- the tables oak no cloth on -- theres
a lot of those beautiful gold cups all down the
table and small ones & silver plates & such great
joints of meat they look like roast geese 3 or 4 of
them and then there comes a dish of meat looks
brown all over alike I dont know what it is.

Now theres the Ladies and Gentlemen
all sitting round. they do look so pretty, they
are all eating and drinking. They are the forest
party. the better sort are up above and the others
down here. - they dont talk to the others. now
they are fading all the color's going I cant see them

My sister in law expects in a few week[ly] to be confined of

I have written to Robert Owen the Philanthropist as
directed by you & he has answered me very courteously
thanking me for the information but still expressing
his entire belief in his spiritual communicants being the
souls of the deceased friends they represent themselves '

5003 I am gratified to know that you have done
all you possibly can to enlighten him
The issue of course is in the hands
of GOD by his grace I hope still to
convince him of his error. I will know
from his guardian spirit the best way
of satisfying him.

When will you give me any further information
concerning him.

Selina took the Evani mirror & shortly from a face
a mans face sideways -- very white thick hair --
rather dark face -- white neckerchief -- in a few minutes
the face turned round & showed rather a bald or
very high forehead, now I see a part of the black
coat collar.  he seems leaning back on something
white he looks as though muffled up in a large
white comforter. I can see his hand holding it
121
he looks very old, now he has got spectacles
on which seem to glisten as though he 
was sitting near a great light. now he
has turned round towards you.
Now hes turned round sideways &
seems as though holding a handkf

the ear. now the Hdf's gone and he is
full face again
hes turned his back towards you
now hes placed the pocket Hdf again to

The CA's here in white with wings

Is it agreeable for me to give you the further inf.n
concerning Robert Owen promised last Tuesday
evening if you have obtained it from his G.S.
5008 
I have obtained it and as he wished
to know the name of the spirit you
communicate with [him] give him mine__
perhaps by that means he will be able
to find out that I am not one of the
evil spirits he has been specially
guarded against
His Guardian Spirit makes it
known to me that it will not be
advisable to write to him for a short time

I will write to him when you advise
5009 In twenty days

May I ask the name of his GS.

The Rev. Mr Godfrey a minister of the Church of
England Has written 2 pamphlets on table moving
which appear to me extremely silly amongst the
questions to a spirit who answered by tipping the table
and who had informed them he was in Hell -- he asked
the spirit if he had ever seen [Dives?] to which the 
spirit replied Yes. -- Is not that a false assertion

5011 It is 
Hell is not a place of torment as supposed 
by many  -- It is a state of being -- in
which those persons exist who leave
this world and go to Jupiter.
The persons there know every thing
that takes place, every thing they have
done while on it. and have the misery
and uncertainty of knowing if they
shall have further punishment, but
still at the same time they know the 
blessing and happiness good spirits and
angels enjoy

Your kind answer has precluded the necessity of 
another question which he propounded as to the Fire & 
Brimstone [& treacle] nature of hell torments
5012 I cannot understand that a man of
good understanding and enlightened
mind can read the Bible through and
so perfectly transform it as many have
done and are doing now.

It has long been my opinion that the cause of our
now [twisting?] so ready & so increased a communion
with spirits -- is thro the practice of animal magnetism
having seduced so many persons clairvoyant & exstatic
is that the case
5013 Animal Magnetism is a great link
between the spiritual & the mortal world
but there is another which bonds it stronger
123
May I ask what that power is
5014 The approach of the Millenium

May I ask what event will foreshow its approach
5015 Religious Liberty

When the Millenium is attended to by Jesus & his
apostles it is spoken of as tho, then at hand even
in the lifetime of those existing, can you explain to
me the discrepancy -- if its being so long deferred
The answer came very slowly & imperfectly indeed it had
done so all the action
5016 Before the -------------------------------------

May I request to know the cause of this imperfect ansr.
5017 It arises from my inability to come
close enough
When the silver signet is made I shall
then be able to converse freely.

Is the pattern I have here made correct or will
you please to show my seer the drawing again
5018 That is quite correct except in size.

how large shall I nave it made
The CA shook his head and the size appeared in the
mirror close to the front so that Emma measured
it precisely
I thank you I will get it in hand tomorrow
Is there any other name or character which it is 
advisable to engrave on the back.
5019 No. If you would wish to have any
other talisman it would be perfectly
right to have it on the other side

I do not wish to have any other talisman, but one
which you might please to give me that would be 
of service to me or my seer
5020 I could give you one against any thing
you wish most

May I ask by whom the apocalypse in the New Test
was written
5021 The last time I appeared you asked me
124

9 20" P.M. The Evani Glass
9.30 Called R. F. Burton
Now its light I see some sand, all sand
now I see some camels one is laying down the other
two standing up theres a black boy with a tremendous
rough wig, he looks like a negro laying down theres 
a tall dark man with a black beard & moustachios
and no hair -- he's quite clean shaved. he looks so
funny he's got some sort of a white dress & trousers
on and something round his waist loosely tied at
the side and something like a knife but no sheath
stuck in something coming from the girdle, it hangs
I quite recognize the correctness of this vision -- the old
grey man, the negro little boy and the quarrel about the
pipe: this is easily ascertained by a reference to my
"Pilgrimage."
Richd. F. Burton

Mr. Burton entered this attestation [30h June 1]
[Venus symbol] die 5h July 1861

The circumstance related took place 4 Septr. 1853
See Pilgrimage Vol. III p.108.
125
from the girdle, he looks quite white against the
black boy -- he's got a head of hair, theres no mistake
about that -- its getting plain theres sand coming
behind them, and clump of trees more like dried
thyme -- theres tents they are very low not peaked
they look as though you would be obliged to creep in
The tree if it is a tree looks more like a bunch of
dried thyme sticking up above the tent
New theres two or three dressed like the
other who are lying flat down upon their faces
theres one smoking he's standing up, none of them
have any hair the one standing up is dressed in
yellow and white striped dress & rather a greyish
blue round the bottom, they are comical looking
little figures -- now theres one gone up to the first
I don't think he's Mr Burton though he has such
black hair and eyes  the others is a nasty lookiing
old man, his beard is grey he does show his
teeth so -- hes all action he looks like a monkey
going to eat him. it is Mr Burton -- the old
many keeps on spitting -- he looks so spiteful -- 
Mr Burton only smiles.
Now the boys jumped up, I don't 
know hardly what shape he is, I never saw
such a droll boy -- he looks almost a dwarf
the one[s] that is smoking would be good looking
if he had some hair -- the black boy's gone up to 
him and laid hold of his pipe and took it
out of his mouth now they seem quarrelling
theres two or three more round them
Now there's such a beautiful horse
come up and a man with a turban the side of
it, hes the only one with a turban on.
They all seem quarrelling -- The old man seems
exactly as though he was going to eat the other
he has grey beard and moustachios and wide mouth
but still white teeth for an old man
Now its going it's all gone 10' to 10 P.M.
126
5' to 10 PM Invoked Evani    Evani Glass
Now there the outline of a ladys face come
and a gentleman too -- the gentleman has a very fair
skin -- no whiskers -- no hair about the face -- his hat
off -- very smooth where the hat goes and then comes
full out -- rather full face hazel eyes -- the hair is very
light brown -- white cravat. - collar -- black frock coat
waistcoat and black trousers -- Wellington boots. he's 
very nice looking
The lady is a droll looking person
with black hair, brought entirely off the forehead
which is very prominent and dark -- yellowey-black
eyes a nice shaped nose very thin face her neck is
bent forward -- very white and I think a wedding
ring on. -- shes very handsome & yet not pretty
She is nearly as tall as him -- it is a wedding ring
he has a ring on. he's younger than her, she has
 a roll of black velvet & lace round her nob of hair

I am glad to hear you are so well & hope you will remain so
5030 thank you I am sure I wish you the same

how is it you have not come into our crystal lately
when I've called you.
5031 I have been very much engaged lately I looked
in my crystal last Friday evening and had
a friend of yours in.
127
Who was that
5032 a Mrs. Lea

And pray what did that young lady want
5033 She told me a little -- that if I believed
it -- but there I've done -- I am not
going to say any thing.

Whilst inspecting we were eating some cake & Mr A said
5034 What not a bit for me

Emma here offered him some,
5035 No thank'y I'll have a kiss instead
This lady this friend of yours told me
she had the pleasure of your company
very frequently -- sometimes once a week
-- rather a fat one -- 

Have you had any thing curious in the crystal lately
5036 Yes a great many strange things
Prin
I here drank some spirits & water & he sd.
5037 At it again then -- drink drink drink
You might let me take a glass with
you

Some day I hope we shall have that pleasure
I have found out the secret of the palingesia of
plants its done by --
5038 Yes I suppose

do you think its true about Prince A being a Russianite
5039 O yes, he'l have cause to repent shortly.

7 PM. CA Miror
Invoked the C.A.
have you any further information in reference to Mr
Owen the philanthropist
5042 do not write before the day I last named
and give him my name that he may
have the opportunity of calling me
as he wished

As Mr Owen only evokes rapping or writing spirits
in which of those ways may I ask do you intend 
to answer him.
5043 I would cause another to write

10' past 7
To See Henry Richards [Ely?] decd.
Now a mist or spirit form has appeared
5044 He has lost his mortal form & with
it all recollection of [his] earthly things.

In what sphere then is he in
5045 In the 2nd sphere.

May I ask what is the occupations of the 
souls of deceased mortals when they attain
the 2nd sphere.
5046 The meeting of friends, music harmony
the visiting of angels, preparing for
a better state, and spiritual communion

You mentioned the meeting of friends may I ask
an explanation
5047 Those in the same sphere

Your Son A.A. entertains the belief that at death
the soul lies dormant in the grave. -- or elsewhere
until the Judgment day -- may I ask your belief
5048 the moment a spirit leaves the body
if it is a good spirit, it is conducted by
its Guardian into the atmosphere

have you in any way an objection to being called with
our Mirror or Crystals.
129
5049 No not in the Least

Is my brother Henry in the same sphere with you
5050 he has left me for the 3rd sphere and is
praying that I may join him.

truss of hay each side -- there looks like some gravel
round the shop, but all the rest is very rough, its
not a very nice looking house, it goes upon a peak
behind at a long distance are some hills, they are
very rough, they look like gold. like the sun
setting behind them. -- they are mountains and
this house is in a hollow. theres pieces of wood
like poles and rough pieces of wood sticking out
of the houses some sheep running about, they dont
do on the gravel its getting plainer. theres a little
white cow in the window -- it has a moveable head. 
Theres a tent in the field a little lines down 
behind the house it goes down there and then up

Evani Glass
Called Lt RF Burton
8' to 9. Heres Mr Anderson dressed in black
How do you do this evening
5052 O we had an escape of gas last night &
I am nearly suffocated

How did that happen
5053 One of the small pipes burst which goes
from the drawing room to my bedroom

How is it you came into our Evani Glass so readily
5054 because I understood you wished me

We are going to the Lyceum again
5055 I haven't been there since I went to
see you
I went to the Victoria the other night

What have they got a Ballet there
5056 Yes and pretty fair too

I've not been there for this 30 years nearly
5057 Oh its worth your eighteen pence
131
Do you remember the mirror you advised me to
make like yours
5058 Yes they told me I had done mine
wrong but they never told me how to 
alter it, but I can see things very nicely
in it

Why I told you how to alter it, we use ours and see
very well
5059 Its preferable to the crystal in many 
respects and if it were more generally 
known would I have not doubt be used
by a great many more  can see see in it
I am very certain of that, but I am
very careful of letting people see mine
I had enough of that with my friend

How so
5060 Oh a frightful vision appeared through
it and I never used it since

May I ask the nature of the vision
Emma remarked here some reading come but I
cannot make it out
\Will you please to come into our crystal
5061 Certainly I will

The Japan Crystal
He is here
What was the nature of the vision
5062 A dark cloud seemed to pass entirely 
over the top of the mirror, at least it
seemed as though I could see for miles
and over the whole space was hanging
this terrible black cloud
When suddenly the cloud seemed 
to burst in a number of places and
streams of blood to rush through the 
clouds to the earth beneath, as each
stream descended it instantly formed 
into the most hideous appearance of 
132
5062 evil spirits one appeared as numerous eyes 
And with a very wide face without any portion 
of the head, another with horrible black horns 
in fact all the most frightful things 
you could possibly imagine. 

This was bad enough but fancy 
my amazement when each separate figure
formed into the different features of a face
the whole being united and fixed was the
exact features of the person who had inspected
the Mirror the last time I used it.

The face itself appeared horror stricken
as though the very breath of life had been
suspended in terror, the eyes were bloodshot
and started forth and the mouth naturally
rather large was drawn back as though
a person was grasped tight by the back
of the neck, and every moment strang.n
was taking place, and instead of the 
skin appearing smooth and clear it was 
in deep ridges as though it had been actually
chopped across and across in either way
So large and deep were the cuts in the 
face that I could the bones underneath
perfectly distinct which were black,

Shocked as I was at the sight
I continued looking and for about four
minutes it remained unchanged. When
Suddenly without changing its position
the whole seemed to crumble into dust
and from the dust again sprang the same
face but perfectly changed  the skin
this time was perfectly like a moles
so smooth and soft.  -- it was black 
all that could be seen of the eyes was
the white, no eyelashes, no hair no
eyebrows, the mouth was wide open
133
5062

but this time round & toothless the chin
was very sharp and from it projected
two horns hanging downwards they were
green -- other hideous things were forming
round it when I could look no longer
I covered over a silk handkf over the
front of the Mirror and discharged it
three times -- 

Two or three persons were in the room 
with me who perhaps noticed my alarmed 
appearance - who asked me  what it was 
I did not answer them then, but took
the mirror and brought it out of the
room.

I put it carefully in its place
locked it and have not since opened it
I returned to the room told my friends
what had happened, when we all
immediately recollected that the last
person who had inspected it, and the
person whom I had seen, a very careless
& dissipated young man had said when
looking it it

"Rise devils to my Aid & show thy
proffered gifts."

We expostulated with him on the lightness
of his conduct pointed out to him the
seriousness of the matter, and I indeed
was very angry that one who I had
taken a great deal of pains to instruct
so very imprudent -- but however he saw
the vision that was asked for quite 
distinctly -- and some other things -- 

After sitting there about half
an hour he suddenly jumped up drank
off a glass or two of wine that stood on 
the table and making a very childish
134
excuse for leaving us so early & left but
his manners seemed altogether changed
from when he began. -- I thought he was 
annoyed at our being angry with him
and called the next morning to se him
one thing after another happened
and I could not get there before 3 or
4 oclock when I arrived at his house he 
was not at home -- I left my card of 
course thinking that was as good as 
seeing him -- I did not see him after 
that until the vision -- I have told you 
nor have I seen him since

I thank you - that was indeed a curious event &
deserves a serious consideration
5063 A friend of mine has promised me 
the narrative of a vision that he himself 
took down as it was described by a
seer in the South of Italy - you shall 
have a copy of it on my receiving it if
you wish I was told it was very 
interesting

I shall indeed be gratified by receiving it
5064 I shall be sure to have it before next 
Tuesday. because I saw him on Friday
night. and and he told me he would [?] 
it out on Sunday morning,. but I 
suppose I am detaining you

No not if it is convenient to you to stay.
I then told him of the communication as to the
palingenesia of plants being performed by evil spirits
& then seals
Have you ever done it so
5065 No I have not

I am also promised a seal to make our visions
135
more Easily Seen & Read
5066 that will indeed be very agreeable but from
seeing myself I can of course present
and employ means of rendering them
plainer and more distinct which others could not do.

Had you not better ask your GS to give you his 
seal for the same purpose.
5067 I will do so , I should very much
like to have my GS changed for many
many reasons. could it be accomplished 

I will ask the CA the best means of doing so
& getting a good & truthful spirit appointed
5068 I should indeed be very grateful
have you found any change since the
CA became your guardian angel -- I mean
could hope to do so

I told him the results.
5069 but have you found any beneficial results
to yourself through it.

I have every reason to feel satisfied with the
change and to be thankful for it
5070 That of course is sufficient

Is C.A.W.L. you Guardian Spirit
5071 Yes I have of late been very unfortunate
in my choice of friends --
A very near relation that I was extremely
fond of and who was up to that period
very fond of me, he was an old man --

The response here came indistinct & Mr A said
5072 As it appears impossible for me to give 
my answers plain I will appear next
Tuesday evening & bring you what I 
promised
hes gone
6'past 10 PM.

May I ask Do you belong to an order of Spirits different

       5083   Yes I do

WGD Can you give me any information respecting my Son
  5084         He is quite safe + Well but not very comfortable

When will he return
5085 In 3 years

Will you request him to appear in one of my crystals
5086 Spirits dislike passing over water

Will you as his GS assist Mr Dresser to develop the seeing
faculty in one of his family
5087 I will but it will never be developed sufficiently
for him to obtain correct answers.

WGD Did you know Mr [?] Laschallas when he was 
alive
5088 No

FH Will he appear in the ES crystal if I call him
5089 If the spirit of the crystal will permit
him to appear

[WG]D Would there be any harm in calling him
5090 there would not

FH What order of Spirits did you belong to when you
last appeared
5091 It is sufficient that I belong to a superior
order.

WGD is your power to protect me thereby encreased
5092 Yes

WGD do you know of any evil impending over me at
present.
5093 I know the whole of the future but without
the permission of a power which is all-
supreme I am not at liberty to tell you

I made Mr Dresser a short time since a Magic Mirror
& consecrated it to you will he be able to develope the
faculty of seeing in it.
5094 No he will not.

138

10' to 8. It is still thick here is yourself of course.
Are you my GS.
5095 Yees

Why have you thus come uncalled.
5096 I have wanted to come for some time I came
to say that I do not like the CA for GS.
he exercises too much control over me.
I cant say what I wish now
He will not let me communicate with persons
I wish because you said I made myself
ridiculous

I am afraid you have made me ridiculous by your
appearing in other persons crystals & acting as absurdly
as you do in mine
5097 I shall not do so any more.

Then now depart, mend your manners, & do not grieve
at being under proper control
5098 I do not grieve.

Do you in that state understand how the Palingenesia
of plants is performed.
5099 Yes, I knew it when he told you. but he
will not let me practise it.

Do you know in the spirit state any thing more of
magic than I do in the body. 
5100 No all of my knowledge is of no use now.

Why so
5101 It would be if you changed your Guardian
Spirit -- Orion would be very kind to me then.

[Why so] Upon my giving him some needful advice
he began to leave
Are you obliged to leave
5102 Yes I must.

entering + he disappeared directly + instantly appeared
outside the crystal quite  distinct + plain he then
began throwing what appeared to be pebbles at the
crystal and tho he remained outside the pebbles
appeared to fall in and he then threw a piece of
paper which fell outside he immediately stood up
on tip toe to throw it in he had a most droll
appearance
      The crystal remained most beautifully
clear but which ever way it was turned he remained
looking into it Emma put the crystal down a
little time but on taking it up he was still blue
and I then said now young [?] I wish you'd
[?] but he still looked in as solid as usuall
and we were obliged to leave off

Emma remained quite still - but Selinas hand was much
moved but she only made straight lines oblique perpend.r

whilst waiting to witness Selina - Emmas hand made the
opposite drawing resembling a coffin & mans head under. I then
wrote the question "do you wish any more questions answered." &

I am about to obtain ever lasting happiness-the purity of
the spirit will be separated from its greatest curse rembrance

Always near thee ever round thee

evening
CA

Will the CA inform us if Emma will be a writing medium this
evening

he will answer questions

Will the C A please to inform us why Semirus formerly said
he was an angel of the sun -- & last Sunday said he was 
an angel of the IAA order

Since that time he has been progressing towards happiness and
otherwich a highr gegree one month is time enough to raise them from one
sphere to another as estimated by mortals

May I ask if spirits of the AA order are higher in knowledge 
& happiness than spirits of the sun

they are
will the C.A be pleased to inform me if Omo is
now, or will this Evening guide Selinas hand
he cannot!
may I ask the CA to inform me what spirit is now
causing her to write
OSMOND he formerly, liveth on this earth and as a spirit
of water which accounts for his simpathy
Is this Osmond. the Guardian Spirit of Mr Gilbert Gilke
no
Can you inform me the name of Mr Gilbert Gilkes
Guardian spirit
Osmond angel of hades +
Have the names of Spirits any particular meaning or 
signification
yes the same as mortals +
Will the Crowned Angel inform me by what means or cause
Emma wrote the letter which came for Mr A Powell of
mortals before their birth have one particular
name assignest them could it be [?]
aright they would express mans destiny such
hapiness or mercy*
That would tend to induce the Belief that man
is predestined to be either good or bad from his birth
It is not so *
Then I presume the name foreshows only his world
prosperity or misfortune
153
you are right [?] yourself *
Will the CA be pleased to make the last answer plainer
his spiritual happiness is left for himself to inform
or destroy [?]
Will the Crowned Angel without being offended allow me
to ask him to write an answer in a language which
I & Emma do not understand.
If to convince unbelievers I will not if you
cannot understand it why wird it [?]
I thank you
I perceive the answers [?] are erroneously spelt
as Emma would have spelt the words -- this which
happens also to others appears to me & others unaccountable will
you oblige me by explaining it
he cannot form his [?]into words much
he cannot form his words into right leters

would be able to use many formulas that you have at present great scruples about on account of thear being what 
you an your over refined feelings call evil spirits but which in thruth are not worse than many you communicate
with in your everyday life I cannot help thinking that you might in some degree consult
the the wishes of your double or other self I have had many long and interesting inter[??]

wish and readyness to attach himself to you as soon as possible  your present guardian
spirit is so particular as to my behavour and conduct in general  - I wish you to promise before

[Mars symbol] die 2nd May 1854 Continued. The C.A Mirror
 Having finished the Gospel of St. Matthew P.
and not having any more scriptural questions to propose I 
wish to ask why as you ment last Tuesday, that you 
Could not stay long "Tomorrow prevents therf" ..You 
Could not stay as you wished
(No answer)
I cannot contemplate without great horror the thoughts
that in the 19th Century of Christianity nations sh.d be plunged
in War so many thousands, Men Women & Children, lose
their lives in every conceivable degree of Sin,.. & the misery
& sorrow of the widows & orphans occasioned thereby, at
the Will of a despotic Sovereign - would it not be 
better, that the Emperor Nicholas, as any other
miscreant ocasioning an unjust or aggressive War
2
should by a fit of apoplexy be stopped at the very
commencement of their atrocities--1/2 a dozen examples
would doubtless suffice -- & surely that would be better
than so many thousands butchering one another.
582
5925
It would not, all those who die in or
through the War, who are innocent of the
cause only suffer for a moment thro the
loss of them & as many of them who die
      they are removed to a state of 
happiness and the world is lessened of
a too greatly increasing population -- 
whereas if the head & Chief was to die
suddenly while contemplating the
aggression of which he was the cause
he would be everlastingly lost and the
world in no way the better
You look upon death as a horrible
Event depriving men of their happiness
I look upon it as the greatest blessing 
to man.  that of throwing off all
Earthly matter & entering unalloyed
everlasting bliss.
But those who are Engaged in War are thereby rendered
unfit to face their Maker, take Badajoz for instance
5926    583  It is not so

The world is large Enough for all had they not 
better be cultivating the Steppes of Asia, the Wilds
of America or the plains of Australia
5927    584  There is room enough for them to
live in but there is not money enough
to keep them when one class has the money
3
the other must suffer for it.
during the late War Te deums were sung by opposing
Nations for the same battle — & [are] priests are still ready
& willing at the bidding of their governments to hoodwink
the populace in the same manner during this War, is
not that a Crime
5928   585 It is very sinful

May I ask your view & opinion of the day of "fasting
& humiliation" as it was termed which took place
last Wednesday here in England
5929 586 No answer

did you think it right & proper
5930 " No answer.

May I ask why atmospheric spirits of my friends
[should] among me by their presence, when they w.d
not do so upon any account in the body.
5931 587 I will answer that at another time
5932 588 I wish you to understand before I leave
this mirror that nothing causes me
so much displeasure - or nothing is more
likely to prevent good visions from appear.g
than money or presents between people
for the use and instruction of spiritual
matters.      and the article of dress
or ornament wears heavily upon the
person who receives it as a recompense
for such spiritual information

I explained &c
5933 589 I know that you have not received
yourself any thing, I am not alluding
4
to that, but that you have given it &
altho ostensibly for another purpose it is
only for that.

I again explained my intent I hoped it would not come
as my displeasure-
5934 590  Not anger his grief, for in doing that you
have been undoing what I have so long
been trying to induce, unlimited confidence 
between myself and You.
I explained.
5935  591  You entirely misunderstand me. 
5936 592   Yes I will do so, but do not do it again
                  It is for your own sake, that I ask it
                  let everything  no matter great while the 
                  Value it is the same pass between you.

                                Invoked Constantine
                               No Vision

  He immediately appeared in Uniform. Blue trousers

How are you getting on at Malta.
5939
Quite well thank you, I hope we shall
not stay here much longer now, nothing to
do and such a lot of idle young men
together. They lead me so much into
mischief.
You saw Miss Green the other evening
after I left didn’t you, what did the old 
Virgin say.

No, but seriously— (here he put a grave face 
on) since I have been at Malta I have
tried several times to see if the faculty of
seeing was entirely gone. For that
purpose I got a common looking glass
I summoned a spirit that informed
me, another was at the same time who was
nearly connected with me, in your
mirror from his saying that of course
I asked him what he was  telling you

And what did he say
5940
After great difficulty he made himself
understood to say that you was then
asking questions concerning ceremonies
of Baptism consecrating marriages & Burials as now
performed in the Church of England.

That is true I was doing so
5941
that was of course all new to me being
a Roman Catholic in Religion, & when in
England never attending the Church
of England, after some remarks I asked
6
that was his opinion if those ceremonies
as performed in the Church of England x
he said that none of them was
necessary. Now I don't think that
agrees with my kind of Religions feeling
of whatever sect.  that no ceremony is
necessary either for Baptism(Confirmatn
I believe to be perfectly superfluous)
Marriage & Burial what is your opinion
I told him my opinion that "Justification by Baptism"
was an Error
5942  Our priests strongly uphold that
           and on marriage I was told that was
          perfectly unnecessary.
So it is as a religious rite- the English Law has
Established it now as a civil law.- The Society of Friends
do not use either Baptism or Marriage as a religious
rite. 
                               do they not- but if no ceremony at 
                5943       all is to consecrate a marriage It
                              does entirely away with all morality
                                         Roman Catholics do not treat it 
                                     in that light- 
Yet it is much easier to get divorced in Roman Catholic 
Countries than in England
5944                    Ok Yes
                            Why he can jump out of Purgatory
                            for a Sovereign any time.
Yes but you do not, can not believe that priestly juggle
no, but it is frightful to think him
5945 Many of the lower orders do in Spain
7
Have you lost your troublesome Phantom Visitors yet
5946  Yes at present I have.
Will you come in next Tuesday
5947  I don't suppose you will have time then 
but if I I have I will call if agreeable
5948  Quite so

Invoked the C A.
1/4 to 8. PM.  He's here as usual.
May I ask if it will be agreeable for you to favor me with
the remainder of the Information as to these spiritual
apparitions
5949  593  I will have you any other questions
not this Evening and I beg to receive the continuation in 
reference to these Spiritual Apparitions

5950  594  Before the Earth was made about 2000
Angels were created [they were] made in the 
image of their [Creator] Maker.  There was no
distinction between them, [and] they were 
Angels of the Highest Order

When the Earth was made and the
first man, it was the intention of the 
Divine Master that these Angels should
have the Guardianship of those upon earth
and the whole generation of their offspring

One of these Angels was expelled 
from the highest order for his endeavors
8
594 to create in the minds of the others a desire
5950 to become the rulers entirely of the earth, in
this he succeeded partially with some but
over the majority of them he had no influence

He was degraded for this, but in no 
other way punished -- he then blasphemed
The most High and cursed the human
race., for this he was banned out of the 
spheres and left to dwell upon earth
It was thro' him that the orders of Angels
were divided, the Holiest were those who
would not hearken unto him., These then 
constituted the seven spheres.  

The second agreed with him a
little, the 3rd more so, they all agreed 
more & more with him until they came
to the first, and they agreed with him
at that time almost entirely

At this time no place of punishment
was made, but Eve being then created
and living with Adam in the Garden
of [Eden].  Paradise, He thought he could
not make his revenge on those who had
expelled him than by making her eat
 the for[e]bidden fruit.

For that he was banned into the
boundless space in which the world
was a [?].

Once being there he soon created
monsters in the waters under the earth
he then had no companions in the
A 
Cain, Dr Pye Smith in his Scripture Testimony I 231-233 
"presents the argument in the following pointed [?]"
Dr Eadie (in p 80 [?] Cyc.) gives this pointed [?]
but it more resembles "The Adam & Eve of Milton" than 
[any] Moses.--
The Burthen is that the Exclamation 
by Eve "I have gotten a man from the Lord" had 
reference to the promise of a coming Redeemer in 
Mans nature to save our guilty race, and that 
Eve supposed in this first birth the promise was 
fulfilled.

"It is a poor, mean, and narrow conception of 
the Damned which Drexelius hath laid down

5950   Human form and so be continued 
planning new modes of destruction until 
the birth of Christ.

The reading has become difficult to Emma

1704   By that time many had died upon 
the earth, and Cain who the earliest that
he had induced to Commit Sin, and
had received their souls into his own 
hands. A
   At the time of the Birth he had 
on his dominions about 300 souls for 
some time after that period they
increased very rapidly so that up to the
year Seventeen hundred and four there
were 15000 Souls with him, but 
since that time Religion has gradually
become more prevalent, not so many
mortal Crimes have been committed
and what have been done, have in a 
great many cases been repented of
so that at the present time there
is not more than 1675 souls in
Punishment   Considering the many who
have died happily and have attained
perfect as partial happiness, the 
number is not many
[*note B*]  Very different from what is supposed
by many very learned clergy.
   The number of angels from the 
Creation of the World down to the Birth
of Christ and continually increased

[*All numbers in spiritual
communication are to be recorded
with diffidence = in no other
way to spirits - So much differ
with each other & themselves

and [papers?] ]have?] [always?] [?] differently
in being read.*]
by many very good men who left the 
Earth and at the time of the Birth the 
number in the whole of the Seven Spheres 
was 5500. But if there the Heavenly Host 
was 1500, the Remaining Spirits of the 
Mortals who had inhabited the earth were either [passed?] the state of Bless [?]

then who were not [?] angels grew
in the atmosphere awaiting [Protection?]
all those 5000 angels [?] the Guardian
spirits of [?] upon faith [?]
the population increased the number of
angels increased also from those who died. 

      Since the Birth of Chid the
number of angels has increased that at
the present time there is about half the number of angels as there are  [?] upon Earth.

And upon requesting the C A [?] render the response 
plainer. The mirror appeared thus
595  [drawing]  I cannot understand
5951 [drawing] why you have so much
[drawing] difficulty in knowing
[drawing] what I say.
I explained I requested his aid in making it plainer
596 I will do so
It is some one so strongly wishing to
5952 see you, that prevents its being plainer
Before I continue my explanation
have you any question to ask on what
I have said - if you have I will ansr.
them now and then proceed.
I [?] thanks and declined
The C A proceded
597  The [?] [?] was the first means
of divining by the Crystal, Its origin
was Semi-Divine from this all other
modes of Divining arose. - [that in the
first place] give [gave] man a desire to obtain
knowledge unknown to others, 
as [people] mentors increased in knowledge [?] [that]
became more frequently used [and is the
best mode of arriving - it] & is the best
means by which any spiritual knowledge 
can be gained

This so closely connected with 
the Spiritual World that any one using
that with the give of second sight can
5953       12
597 see thro that into the spirit World, the
spirits do not actually appear in that
nor the atmospheric spirits, but you
through that look in at and converse
with them, while moving thro' their own
[*check mark*] sphere. - [It is] in the same way that you
make a window in a house to look into
the street -- You shll stay in your room
but if you wish to converse with any one
in the street you would speak. [How??]
courtesy would oblige them to answer
that is the way with the Atmospheric
spirits

Wherever [With the] Guardian spirits & spirits
of [a][the] higher orders [it is rather different
wherever they] move in the spiritual
World the air that surrounds them
is cleared of every thing in any degree
more gross than themselves

Thus if an atmospheric spirit
meet a Heavenly spirit the atmospheric
spirit yields to the pressure of the air
that surrounds the other [spirit] [?]
to let him pass.  in this way he visits
the atmosphere, the spheres lower than
his own. & the Earth. Without once coming
in contact with those below him. unless
he wishes it - so that when he is called
on to converse with the person who calls
him - the callers thoughts or rather
will immediately reaches him the appears

5953        13
598  [sending] separating before him all influence less
angelical than his own. whether bodily
or spiritual

Guardian Spirits and Angels 
of the highest degree are only seen in the 
[?] [?], the Crystal, & then in the Glass
[and the Globular Vessel of Water].

The other modes of divining with
by circle work - or by [?and] - is by ink
or indeed any other way is only for 
the purpose of seeing dead persons
atmospheric spirits, [and ?] wandering spirits
& [?] spirits --

Unless [a] persons study long and 
earnestly the different ways of developing
the [?] [?] with human 
reason for [their] his guide, with truth and
good intentions, the benefit of their own
body & soul and next to that the good of 
others they never can arrive at any degree
of perfection in divining

They never can place reliance
upon it and they never can arrive at
the Truth. - If any one wishes to begin
this study I would give them a few
directions - 

I [?] thanks &c.

599 I will - to yourself they are now
useless, but the may be a guide to
5954 others who are just starting

This is in Vol 4 of the draft at the end of the Vol.
600                                                                                                                                                                        14
5954 Having first procured a good clear
stone or medium. one that no spirit has been called
in before - and, supposing he could not see
himself, a Seer.  He must determine
[not] to use it for no bad purpose, I
do not say determine to use it only for
good purposes .  because many frivolous
[?fling] things might occur that would
induce him to use it on many occasions
for the knowledge of things appertaining
to the Flesh. but having determined now to use 
it for [no] any bad or unholy purpose. He
should dedicate it first with
a fervent prayer to God.

5955  Do not make use of a Mediator
but firmly yet humbly trust that 
God will put you in possession of a 
GS. that will put you in power as show
you the visions you may hereafter wish

Having done this inspect the 
Crystal and before asking to see any
vision ask the name of your GS.  
And having done this ask to see him 
and ask him to give you any advice 
he may think fit.  in using it ask 
him to name the days that he will appear
& also the ones on which you may see other
visions ask him to become the GS 
of your Crystal to prevent any Evil Spirit
from appearing and to give you timely
15
600
5955 Notice of any thing about to happen to
you that you may prevent it or that he 
may prevent it for you. This done
discharge him [by].      he should
not be kept more than half an hour
at the first meeting.
When you invoke him the next
time you know the invocation & discharge
ex 3 times before you ask him any
questions if at those 3 times he does
not vanish you may perfectly rely 
upon [you] him.
After the first time you may keep
him as long[s] as it suits your & his
Convenience. If he wishes to leave he can
go without a discharge but be careful
that you always use a discharge After
having finished of a night.
On invoking any atmosphc. spirit or the
Spirit of any inferior degree such as 
those of the [sun symbol] & [moon symbol]  _ the atmospheric
Spirits of living as well as dead people
always use the term "If convenient or
Agreeable". or at your pleasure. But more
particularly of a living person. _ to a
Spirit of a higher order or your GS,. it 
is not necessary.
But above all do not use it
in any way. Or make it directly or
Indirectly an object, for the gaining
of money It may appear to go on
16
600
5953  very smoothly for a few times you may have
the information and the visions you wish
for but for in the end the consequences are 
lamentable - and the come sooner or later

When you have got used to a Crystal, feel 
confidence in it and assured in many ways 
of the Truth of it, then you can [either use] use a 
mirror [?] [or a bottle of water.  The mirror is a
great deal] [?] the best.  a very great deal the
best. [for water however pure always
contains an animal substance].

The mirror you use the same as a
Crystal but from seeing visions so large and
lifelike and from the size of the hole which
is made by that in the Spiritual [World]
Wall it enables you to come more closely
in contact with the spirits you address

of all modes of divining this is
the easiest and the best.  [the trouble is not
great the expense is still less so], the
information is given slowly at first but
gradually more and more until you reach
the grand heights of all human knowledge
upon spiritual matters.  Until you know
as much as the human mind can in
any way comprehend of what passes
beyond its own world

By the allegorical picture of the
city of human habitations & the wall that
surrounds it I meant the world and 
its inhabitants

17
600 The space above it the atmosphere
5955 the walls that surround it, the bounds
of human knowledge unassisted by 
spiritual aid, and the holes in those
walls which so few could reach., the way
of attaining the [?] and the only true
Method of Divining -

When there you are still liable to
great error unless helped and directed by
your Guardian Spirit -

The water that surrounds that wall
is what is termed by men Hell, the space
above is the atmosphere, and the seven
that tower above that the spheres of
1926    26  happiness. _ .

On next Tuesday Evening I hope to continue my
questions from the scriptures
601   Do so, I shall be happy to answer them
5956  I wish you to ask any question that
may arise from what I have said
now or before if you think it necessary.

As to, the Formula, [?].  Vol.
602  I will give it you but not this Evening
there is on of your friends that I do 
5957 not wish to know it - Mr  [?]

My wish for many things to be kept
from him does not arise from any derision
that I have for him, but he is so likely
to put it to a wrong use.

I know a gentleman Mr. J C. of Birmingham


The Number of the Damned - see page 9. 
It is a poor, mean, narrow, conception of the numbers
of the Damned which Drexelius hath laid down 
he supposed them to be an hundred thousand millions
of men -– but alas how infinitely short is that 
computation to those multitudes who as many are 
set in opposition by Christ to the few saints, which 
yet no man can remember? 
Revd Tobias Swinden Enquiry page 92  
 
The Merciful Tobias waxeth exceeding [?oth] with Origen for holding
the Heterodox and unsound opinion 
"That wicked men and even devils, after they have
page. 277 suffered a sharp and continued torment for their 
Sins, shall, some at one time and some at 
another, sooner or later, according to the greater or 
less depravity of their wills be reconciled to God  
and finally saved". 
 
Nay he is most satisfied with those "who affirm not that wicked
men will be saved, but that they shall be reduced 
page. 277 to their first nothing, or that there will be an other
 extinction of their Being." 
 
No says the humane Tobias,  punishment & then anihilation 
is not enough – 
The Mercy of God; which tho infinite as

who has expressed a wish to be present at our evenings
discourse. For he is a  gentleman for whom I have reasons
to entertain the greatest respect.  Will you please to 
appear on the evening that may suit his convenience

603  5958  Certainly I will appear and give you
all the information in my power but
it will be best that Mr. G I [?] should 
not be present at the same time 

May I ask if I am correct on the number of lapsed 
souls (   ) stated by you to be in what Christians 
term Hell.  Seeing that clergymen, with [a] modest ideas 
of their own perfections, are continually dooming in 
pulpit & in print - all who differ from their [?] 
[?] to eternal destruction - & even considers - [Duxelelius' ?]
estimate of lapsed souls at 100,000 millions  a poor 
& pitiful estimate.

604  5957  That is the number
It is not reasonable to suppose that 
the Almighty in His great mercy and 
clemency and loving kindness to 
ALL mankind would allow those to 
be punished who had sinned

It is those who [immediately rush] 
madly rush into sin knowing it to 
be such and commit crime after crime 
and will not hear of the atonement 
repentance but trusts in his own 
might and greatness.  He is perfectly 
careless whether he is saved or punished 

It is for those who on the very 
gallows at the point of death for
[?] exclaim "Now for the grand secret
that no mercy is shown for the
[?] by [?] such as those
would not show himself just to thou
who had been murdered by their hand
He avenges himself and and the friends
of those who are murdered or those who
are really guilty by lasting punishment.
For altho ? of great mercy He
is a God of justice as well and before
acting, he ? weighs the consequences
both for one person and the ? at
large.
A few weeks since 3 men were hung in Ireland for 
the murder of a Protestant. ? the place of execution
they conducted themselves as tho' martyrs for a holy
[?][?]the [multitude?] under the superstitious [?]
of their priests appeared to [?] them as such also.
These men by their priests were induced to believe
that they were some of the heavenly [?] and for their
murderous outrage.
605 It was not their fault poor things
they fervently believed they were doing right 
because those high in religion persuaded 
them to it, and they died without a 
[pang?] because they believe their priests
had the power of keeping them out of 
[?][?]
When whom then will the punishment for
their atrocity fall.
5961 606 Upon the [instigator?] and the [?]


20
of the crime[s] in such a case as that and
those who are killed hurredly & unprepared
are held guiltless

It is looked upon the same as
tho it was an accident which had deprived
them of life

May I ask how long the atrocities of this [?] are
to be a curse upon mankind.

5962  607  It will continue in a degree until
the millenium commences

May we see Mr Anderson this evening after you leave

5963  608  You can if he will appear,
Did he not give you directions for raising
spirits from [?] encircled by water

he did and thought there was no harm in doing
it but thanks to your information, I think it can
only be done by evil spirits

5964  609  He knew they were not good ones.

I did not intend to use it without your sanction
but I often regret that I have no means of giving
[?] demonstration to my friends of the birth of
these spiritual apparitions

5965  610  There are many thousands of persons
who unless they are actually frightened
by a thing will not believe it.

Mr Anderson from being abroad and
with people who practice these things
so long knows almost every means
good and bad. by which spirits may
be raised, called or felt, by a human
person. but he now has been so many

21
times frightened & disturbed by spiritual
visions that he very much wished a little
time ago to lose his power & discontinue the
study and now he has lost it. he wishes
more than any thing else to have it back 
again.

He told Evani the dove angel a
few nights ago, since he has lost all power
of vision except the crystal, but that was not
enough, he was afraid something might
happen he shouldn't know any thing abt.
The CA's gone.  25 to 11 PM.

Called Mr. Anderson

Are you at Gallipoli or Constantinople yet

5967 If he had done it 6 weeks ago I should
have thought it a good deal better I wish
I was at home

Why so
5968 A good many reasons

Autumn comes on I shall come home.

They have not. Man was Created Body

May I ask if at the Birth of Every Child that comes

When Mortals attain the 3rd & 4th Sphere is there any
danger of losing that that happy estate

629
5992   There is not.

[*GIT?*] May I ask where Mr. T is

630
5993   he is with his wife

[*GIT?*]  Do they in the Spirit State know that they once
lived together upon Earth

631
5994  They are Companions, they have
Affection for each other,   but they do

There is no reason why I should not, but I cannot explain to you that state of being which [?] corporeal beings must be as nothing. 
Can you tell me the name of a friend of M. D. Calely deceased and where he now is
[*633*] M.D. GS would be more likely to tell [*5996*] him from his recent death and not having entered the first sphere. I cannot have any acquaintance with him.

By what means were the cures I alluded to performed

6000  637  It was not prayer alone

Will you inform me what other means were used

6001  638  I will tell you another evening

The C A's gone
20' to 10 PM.   Called Frederick Hockley
You are here clothed as at present
Are you my Ay. Spirit


6002  [639] Yes I am

Why did you wish to come in so earnestly this evening


6003  [640]  I came to know if you would call me
oftener, If I would give you information
consistent with the C A's

In what does your knowledge consist different to mine


6004  [641]  I do not know things unconnected with
yourself any more than you do. I act over
again your actions upon earth - Your
knowledge is my knowledge, at the same
time I know that which takes place immed'ly
around me in the atmospheric world

Do you know any Magical formulas which I do not
know Corporeally.


6005  [642]  No

As my knowledge increases does yours also


6006  [643]  Yes

When I called Mr S. the other evening why did you
appear and annoy us so much.


6007  [644]  I could not help it

Do you in your state know the spirit Orion

6008  Yes
Is he a good or a bad spirit
[*6009*] He is [?] a good many on Earth but they do not see him, but atmospheric spirits do. 
Why did you wish him to be your GS when he is not a good spirit.
[*6010*] If he became my GS I should have [t?ea??h] and a good many other things I want you had.
But is he not an invl spirit
[*6011*] Yes I have that [?]
Have you lost a tooth lately
[*6012*] Who is nothing the frivolous question now 
It is not a frivolous question, but I wish you to answer that question seriously. 
[*6013*] When you lost that both the likeness existed no longer. 
When I had it replaced in my mouth was [?] who [?]
[*6014*] No it was not.
Will you inform me how high in your estimation is the atmosphere in which you live. 
[*6015*] I do not [?] to the full extent of the atmosphere, I live about 3000 feet above the Earth.
Do you happen to know how high the atmosphere is above the Earth.
[*6016*] I have never risen above my
the atmosphere joins the first sphere.
I have been taught that above our atmosphere is [?] be completely dark to our Vision
29
Dark to the human vision because the 
Spiritual light commences there. but in 
the light of spirits who dwell there it 
appears darkness to them.
You say you live about 3000 feet from the Earth 
how near do any other Atmospheric Spirits live 
6017 They live all on a level, that is the 
bottom is level to the whole extent but 
there are hills and mountains the same as
in the world and on them the houses 
and likenesses of those who dwell on Earth 
on mountains, so that we cannot be said 
to be on a level
Are none living nearer the Earth
6018 There are not
We have on Earth balloons which ascend more than 3000 
feet from the earth did you ever see one
6019 It is wrong to ascend in them because 
their coming among us causes a great 
disturbance and were it possible we would 
soon destroy them.
There are also mountains considerably more than 
3000 feet high on which persons dwell, such as 
[?] which is above the level of the sea are
they in the region of Atc. Spirits
6020 It is very high but not so high as that 
Are you sure that you have  correct idea of space 
6021 I have the same idea of space as you 
have and the same measure.
Do the Inhabitants of that hill at all interfere with
the Atmospheric World.
30
6022 No because that hill is just under the
same hill with us, but a balloon ascends
at random and disturbs the order of all
things

But you have often assisted 20 years ago in sending
up Mrs Graham in a balloon

6023 I was not my self disturbed but others
have been.

And the inhabitants of the spirit world see the balloon
that ascended

6024 Yes and the image of that balloon as 
it went out of the atmosphere as high
above their level as it was above those
on Earth. I have heard many say
disturbed those living on the height
of the hills the image of those below.

I was often promised an ascent, but something or other
always prevented it

6025 I am glad you did not go and I hope
you never will go

[*GJT]* [did] would you and your other self have met.
 
6026 No he would not for at the same time
I should be ascending he should still
keep at the same distance

Do you mean that the balloon is [?] fed as it
were into the atmosphere

6027 It is, the atmosphere still remains the 
same and when you ascend so your 
Atmosphere Spirit ascends at the 
same rate & when you fall they fall with 
you.
Its getting late I will go now

You kindly favored me with an explanation of the
Blasphemy ag't. the Holy Ghost, but a great number

The sin against the Holy Spirit is verse 30. plainly stated to be
ascribing the miracles of Christ and his apostles to demoniacal 
agency.            They who acted thus could never be corrected to
the Christian faith because they resisted the strongest possible
evidence.  They remained in the same forlorn state in which
Christianity found them; which is expressed by the phrase
"they should never have forgiveness."

Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than

of Unitarian Christians hold that the true rendering of
the word here translated [sin] punishment is Sin and that
the sin against the Holy Ghost is verse 30 plainly stated
to be "ascribing the miracles of Christ and his apostles to
demoniacal agency.

642 I explained to you the Blasphemy against
6033 the Holy Ghost and for that there is a 
punishment which I also described.

going to the house of Jairus whose daughter was said 
to be just deceased

which she would at some time awake

disciples of J. C. were found wanting

648  There are few very few who have suff'

But it is best that all should not
attain it, because som even with suff'
faith would ask for things that were

In the 32nd verse here recited "Neither the Son

Mark 13. v 32.
"But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, 
not the angels which are in heaven-- neither the Son
but the Father.

Ambrose cites Mss which omits the clause "neither the Son" and 
complains that it was introduced by the Asians -- but all
versions & Mss now extant retain it, and it is cited by early
writers -- it proves that Christ is not God because his knowledge
is limited -- nor can it be inferred from the climax that he is 
a superangelic being.

All the instruments by which divine providence
executes its purposes are called angels, and angels are
represented as ministers of Christ and subject to his orders
at the destruction of Jerusalem. -- Prophets are said to
do what they are commissioned to predict -- see Jer. 1. 10.

Thus Christ is said to have destroyed Jerusalem
and angels are represented as acting under him when
perhaps nothing more is intended than that Christ
predicted the event which God in the course of his providence
brought to pass.

Mark 14. 21.
Some would render the clause "Good were it for that man
if he had never been born" -- as

Good were it for him (viz Judas) if that man (viz the
Son of Man) had not been born--

the Douay Transn. is "It were better for him if that man 
had not been born--

that Christ is not God because his knowledge is

Some under this clause "Good were it for him

not been born."

May I ask your explanation of the passage.

653  6045
The verse itself is in the Original the
same as in the English copy.
But the verse itself is not entirely correct

654  6046
"It would not have been better for Judas
had he never been born."

Mark. 16 - 15. 16. 17
Will you favor me with your view of the meaning
of these verses

655  6046
The meaning is so plainly expressed 
there that to repeat it would be
unnecessary.

Mark. 16. 18.
"In my name" did Jesus mean his own name "Jesus"
or "In the name of God"

656  6048
In the name of God

Are we to understand that Baptism under all 
circumstances & in all ages & nations is absolutely
necessary to salvation
Baptism "An ordinance or religious rite which was in use
before our Saviours Ministry began-- Dr. Eadie
36
657
6049
It is not there meant Baptism by the 
Church -- It is meant the Regeneration in 
the next life.  

The words are "He that believeth [not] and is Baptized 
shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned" 
which induce us to believe that they are meant to take
place in conjunction in this life. 

658
6050
If he died in belief from this world and 
is then Baptized, that is born anew in 
the Spirit he is then ready for Salvation 
but should he die even in Belief without 
Regeneration he could not be saved.

In that individual passage in the Bible

Luke 3. 23.
"And Jesus himself began to be about 30 years of age, being 
(as was supposed.) The son of Joseph"
          Protestant Trans'n.
"And Jesus himself was beginning about the age of 30 
years, being as it was supposed, the son of Joseph
          Douay Trans'n.
"And Jesus himself began to be about 30 years of age being
(as was allowed by law) the son of Joseph.
          Unitarian Trans.
The latter is Mr Wakefields translation - Grotius observes
that this can only be used of one who has finished his
thirtieth year [?], [circiter?] may be understood of one who
is something more than 30 years of age. as well as of one
who is under that age.
          This was the age appointed by Law for the Levites to
enter upon their office Numbers 4. 3-47

Archbp. Newman renders it:
          "Jesus himself was about 30 years of age when he began
          his ministry".
D Campbell says
          "Now Jesus was himself about 30 years in Subjection"

Whichever of these versions may be approved it appears from
the uncommon accuracy with which Luke dates his
history that in the 15th year of the Reign of Tiberius our
Lord then entering upon his Ministry was no more than
30 years of age and therefore he must have been born
2 years and 9 months & probably 3 years & 9 months after
the death of Herod.

time of his mortal birth

It has been objected that in the 15th year of Tiberius
Our Lord then entering on his ministry was no
more than 30 years of age  he must have been born
at least 2 years & nine months after the death of
Herod

believe refers to an Event which had
occurred on that day between Christ and
his Apostles but which was not ment'd.

Blood as a sacrifice to the infernal objects of their worship
See More Newchim lib 3.

Rabbi Moses Ben Nachman (on Deut-12-23) says "they gathered
together blood for the Devils their Idol Gods and then
came themselves and ate of that blood with them as being the
devils guests and so were joined in Federal Society with
them and by this kind of Communion with devils they
were able to prophesy & foretel things to come.

influence upon Earth.
In what did the religious rites of zabianism consist
6112 719 Chiefly in paying homage and worship
things created by themselves. Which
they believed they invested with
Spiritual Power by shedding blood
for them and dyeing them with its
color.
Did not Sabeanism Chiefly consist in the
worship of the [sun] [moon] and constellations
6113 720 No it did not. Chiefly consist in that
they certainly worshipped the [sun] and [moon]
believing thru them by the blood which
Zabianism, Zabaism - Sabarnism or Sabaism consisted
in the worship of the Sun & Moon & of the other planetary bodies
and was the most unkind & widely spread of any of the forms
of Pagan Idolatry.  and appears to have been associated with
superstitious rites and ceremonies of a symbolic or incantatory
nature & not infrequently obscene revolting ranting with the
habits of the people by whom they were practiced.
    By the Jews these idolators were designated and their
superstitious practices condemned as " They ways of the Amorites"
    In subsequent ages where other modes of Idolatry
prevailed almost universally,  this more early practice was
denominated Zabianism most probably from the Hebrew
word [3 Hebrew letters here] (tzaba,a host) the Sun Moon & Stars being usually
called the Host of Heaven
                                see Pocockii Specimen Hist. Arab p. 139

Job vindicates himself from this kind of idolatry by the most
solemn asseverations -- Job. 31 v 26 - 28

Moses wrote the pentateuch to continue the knowledge of the
True God among the Israelites - in perusing it one must
never forget that Idolatry had become almost universal
and that Moses constantly endeavored to guard his people
from the contagion. - Many expressions therefore which otherwise
in a narrative so brief as that of Moses might appear unnecessary
were, at the time they were written of the utmost consequence
   Thus when in the account of the Creation Moses adds
"[He] made the stars also" - and"thus the Heavens were finished
and all the Host of them,"  he evidently meant to say to the
worshippers of the Tsabaoth, your Gods are inferior to
Jehovah, for they are the works of his hands."

neither being visible.
But I presume it is only the same class as rapping

Invoked the CA
He is here is white with purple Robes
I have acquired from Mr. Robert Owen, some questions, or rather
conclusions which he has arrived at and upon which he requests
your opinion, I do not wish to offer my own views
Mr. Owen wishes to know if he is right in coming to 
the following conclusions
1st That nothing can never produce something
6132 731 It is right all things are predestined
and one arises from another
2nd That therefore something has eternally existed
6133 732 It had, the world was created from a
Mass without shape and without form
3 That that something is the Elements of the [A?]
6134 733 It was Earth and Air nothing more
I mean that the Earth was created
out of something, and that something
was Earth and Air.
4th That these Elements possess inherent unchangeable
qualities
6135 734 He is right
5th That some [?] of the Almighty power of these
Combined Elements may be conjectured from observing
the extent of [M?] life and instinct, or mind in one
of the [M?] beings seen thro a glass of great
magnifying powers in a drop of water.
6136 735 He is right in that conclusion but not
in using the word mind.
56
6th That the agregate of these Elements constitute the
supreme mind or the Godhead.
6137 736 They do not
7 That then Elements their inherent unchangeable
qualities and their aggregate power or supreme mind
Coexist eternally
6138 737 They do not
8 That as nothing could have existed before them they
they are the great first cause of all things, and that as
nothing can exist after them, they are first and last
and everything
6139 738 They were first but after the end of the
world, they will not exist, they are not
necessary to a Heavenly existence.
9 That these Elements of the [?] their inherent
qualities and their aggregate power or Supreme mind
from the Trinity which [?] call Nature, the
Laws of Nature, and God.
6140 739 Altho without them Nature could not
exist, they do not form part of it
They are not the Laws of Nature neither
are they God.
10 That they are 3 in one and one in three separate
yet indivisible for they Eternally coexist.
6141 740 They are not United, and they have a separate
existence
11 That the inherent qualities of these Elements are the
Laws of Nature.
4142 741 Altho they are the most powerful of
all things when used by God. They are not 
the Laws of Nature.
57

12 Tha the Elements of the universe are matter & spirit
Matter when condensed to human appreciation by our 
senses, and spirit when too refined or etherialized to be
perceived by men except when mesmerized or out of their
Normal State.

742  
6143
The spirit of man can appreciate them
more fully when separated from the body

13 That God and Nature is Omnipotent and
Omniscient.

743  
6144
It is wrong for him to so closely connect
Nature [and] with God
Altho Nature is his work and He is 
the supreme ruler, He views it in the same
way that an artizan would view a
piece of elaborate machinery which he
had made, that would act under one 
principle until he chose that it should
be stopped.

14 & Omnipotent except that He cannot change the
Laws of Nature which would be to change his own
qualities which are unchangeable

744  
6145
As Nature and God are quite separate
so He can change it without changing
himself
They only exist in Unity because it 
is his will, and the most beautiful of
all things.

"The word was a God" -Unitarian  rendering - Jesus received a
commission as a prophet of the Most High & was [?]
with extraordinary miraculous powers, but in the Jewish
phraseology the were called Gods to whom the of God
came ([?] 10-35) so Moses is declared to a God to
pharoah (Exodus 7.1) Some translate the passage God
was the word - q.d. It was not so properly he that
spoke to Man as God that spoke to them by him

This word is applied to Christ four times by the Evangelist John

6205  Last Tuesday Evening you wished for a 
Vision in your Evani Glass.  I did not
leave early enough then.  this evening
you can have one.
   I shall be entirely gone by that time
You can then have one.
   I have nothing of importance to your

next Tuesday I will give you the answer

The C A's going.  20' past 9.
Called Mr. Anderson

Here is yourself  Come dressed as you usually are
I hope you are well, tho I presume you are in your
state much the same as I am in mine

6206  I am the same.

You mentioned that the At Spirits exist only 3000
feet above the Earths surface,  have you a correct idea &
measure of space & distance

6207  I have the same ideas of distance as you 
have  The atmosphere is not quite 70 miles

I do not
You seem to imagine because I am
rather different from yourself that I am
altogether supernatural.

No it is not that, but that I do not know.  nor can
I ascertain   how far you differ from myself except by
questioning you

6217
I suppose you want me to leave now.

We shall be very glad to see you next Tuesday

Evani Glass
Invoked Evani to show a vision

Heres Mr Dresser come - with his spectacles on and a
book in his hand,  a little book  he first looks at the
book and then at you  & then at the book
I remonstrated with him & begged him to leave

6219               
I shall stay her for an hour & a half

Emma then inspected the Mirror but he was there
before her. - & upon turning to the Evani glass he
was there instantly - I need an Vision to dismiss
him & we were obliged to give up inspecting -
72
 ♂︎ die  20 June 1854 -- C A Mirror
Invoked the C A.

The C A is here.  in white purple robes  wings, 6 min & c.  He
is looking towards you  (F. H.)
I explained the annoyance occasioned us by my friend
Mr W E Dressers atmospheric spirit app'g  in the mirror &
Evani glass

804
6220  It is a singular power that he has, the
more he visits you in the body, the more
you will be troubled by his At Spirit

I am sure Mr Dresser would do any thing to prevent
it, I could reasonably wish - can you not prevent his
appearing

805
6221  I cannot entirely prevent it

Is it convenient for you to give me the [?] inf'n as
to Mr Robert Owen and his app't to the Lords of the 
Treasury.

806
6222  He will not succeed in it

Have you any information or advice you wish me to
convey to him.

807
6223  does he intend visiting you

I have told him I should be most happy to see him
here but fear from his great age it might be irksome
for him to do so, I hope soon to have the pleasure
of seeing him in London.

808
6224  You will not visit him before the 5th 
July - before that time I shall have
some instructions to give you concerning
him - 

I thank you & will await your pleasure

John 5 verse 4
This verse is not in the Cambridge MS. one of the most
antient Greek versions now existant & is also by many
commentators deemed spurious -- was it in the original
Gospel of St. John

6225   809   It was not

John 6. v. 4
This verse altho in all the antient MSs. appears to have
been introduced & is deemed by Bishop Pearce & others
to be an interpretation -- chiefly because it is unconnected
with the Text & it does not appear that our Lord attended
this Passover.

6226  810   It was and he did attend the Passover

John 6 v 32. 33
Does the words "The True head of Heaven" here said
to be [?] signify the doctrine or the person of Christ

7227  811  The Body of Jesus

John 6 v 35
By the words "I am the bread of life" did Jesus hereby mean
his Doctrine which wold ensure Eternal life to all
who practically embrace it.

6228  812   Yes

John 6  v 38
did Jesus mean by "I am come down from Heaven"
that he was invested with a divine commission or this
real spiritual descent

6229  813  A Spiritual descent

John 6 43. 44
It appears here that the Jews understood Jesus to mean
that he had corporeally come down from Heaven,
The Unitarians contend that Jesus only alluded
John 6.46
                  "Not that any man hath seen the Father save
                    he which is of God, he hath seen the Father"
ie has known his will -- so verse 40 To see the son is to understand
    the Doctrine of Christ. --                                      [?] Gloss.
74
to his doctrine as having come down from Heaven
from your former responses I conclude, Jesus meant
he had spiritually come down from Heaven  will you
give me the Correct View

814
6230  That the spirit of the Father descended
unto the Earth and was born anew of
the Flesh.

John 6. 46
The Unitarians contend that the words "He hath
seen the Father" means "has Known his will" and
that at Verse 40 the meaning of "to see the Son"
is to understand his doctrine

815
6231  Only one had seen the Father, and that
was he himself who had left him.

John 6 verses 51 to 58
In the Translation of the Gospels put [?] by the Unitarians
appears the following Commentary
Our Lord perceived the mistake of his hearers, but not
desiring to retain them as his followers, he does not
correct it. but proceeds to use expressions [?] more
offensive to their feelings & prejudices; what he means to
inculcate is a practical reception of his Divine Doctrine
as the means of Securing everlasting life. -- this in allusion
to the descent of the manna ver 32.  33.  he first compares to
feeding upon New and Heavenly bread, he then describes it
as feeding upon himself.  verse 51, and more particularly
and offensively as even Eating his flesh & drinking his
blood, ver 53 - 57    this language which they either did
not, or would not understand.  so disgusted many of his

is the only useful sense & if it were possible for you to feed

6232  The Unitarian View is quite correct
That passage in St. John more than any

administered at the Sacrament is really
the body and blood of Christ.

                            was a lesson to mankind perhaps
                            unequalled by any in the bible
May I request your view of the Chapter as a whole
       823              Its simplicity and its beauty so truly
6239                   exemplified the Character and the

                            less Holy than himself.

                            those must have been who held her
                            up to public scorn when Jesus turning
                            to them said
                                  "He that is without sin first cast

833
6250 I have nothing this evening, but I

Then I will leave it at home for a while

Invoked the Dove Angel
Now the pillar is come. Now the Dove is there just

Are you still the protector of this (the Evani) Glass

835
6252  I am

Will you allow my Seer to have one of those visions
you were formerly kind enough to show her
79

836
6253  What vision do you wish to see

One of those beautiful Visions if the Spirit World wch 
my Seer used to see, any that you may please

837
6254   I will do so

Can you tell me any mode of Preventing any

6255   There is a way of dispelling them

Evani Glass
1/4 past 10   we requested a Vision in the Evani Glass which
immed'ly became thick -- & Mr Dresser appeared, dressed
as usual in black with spectacles on - & so plain & nat'l
that he app'd as tho he could be felt. I expostulated
with him for annoying me so. I begged of him to leave

6252 b "You will have more trouble with me
yet."

I exorcised & endeavored in Vain -- To dispel him, Emma
observed that when I thrust my finger at him he disapp'd
but immediately reappeared & when I thrust my [pen?] at
him it seemed to strike a press ag't his shoulder without
and so squeeze his back ag't the mirror of the Evani Glass
which Emma did not like to see.
Upon turning to the C A Mirror & requesting him to
be [censured?] there appeared

843 
6252 b  
Evani does not know any other over Mr. Dressers
 Atmospheric Spirit
6253 b The vision promised is waiting to 
appear--

I asked if there were no other means of dispelling him

844

Mr. Dressers  AS. still keeping in the [xx]  Evani Glass

observed he is still here -- & we left off.
81
♂︎die  27 June 1854.                   present Mr C Stuart
8.30 PM   Invoked the C A.
The C A is here as usual.
If in an emergency I call upon you on any Ev'g this week
will you oblige me by appearing

845
6255 b  I will if it cannot be delayed until next
Tuesday

Have you any Comm'n to make to me concerning M Rob't
Owen this ev'g. [or s]

846
6256 b I cannot give it you until you have rec'd
an answer to your letter.

My friend Mr Stuart is desirous of asking some questions
upon a point of doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church
will you favor us with a reply

847
6257 b  I will

May I ask if there is any Efficacy or beneficial tendency
to the souls of deceased persons - arising from prayers
offered up by Priests - relatives or friends of the deceased

848
6258 b  It is of use to them while remaining in
the atmosphere, afterwards it is not

May I ask in what way the prayer of the living
are of use to deceased souls whilst passing thru the
atmosphere.

849
6259  By unity of Feeling existing between
the souls of mortals and those deceased
before developing their spiritual form

My meaning is do the prayers of the living benefit
the souls of the deceased - thru' God direct or by Jesus 
Christ as a Mediator or the Virgin Mary as an
intercessor

850
8260  It does not. it quickens their progress
82
thru the atmosphere into a higher
spiritual state, but after that it is
of no use.

Is there a place of purgation - of punishment thru
which deceased mortals pass to be cleared from their
sins

851
6261   There is a state of purification, not
punishment in the atmosphere, those
persons who die on Earth, and do not go
directly into Evil ---   --   --   ----  --  -- -
when they have passed the atmosphere
they [have] progress[ed] some much slower
than others but none go back, and at
last they reach the Celestial Sphere where
they remain until the day of Judgmt
and there meet their reward. -----------
Those who depart in Evil remain in an
Evil state until that day and then meet
their [reward] punishment

While therefore the souls of those we love are undergoing
this state of purification, do our prayers benefit them
by exciting them to pray or does the almighty regard
the prayers of the living so that their passage thru the
purifying stage is rendered quicker.

852
6262  Jesus Christ & the Virgin Mary are both
Mediators with God, & the prayers of the 
living are made acceptable to them who
maketh them Acceptable to God.  and he
passes them more easily & quicker thru the
state of purification which fits them for a
higher Sphere.
83
I pray daily for the welfare of a dear departed wife may
I ask if my prayers are made acceptable [to God] and
tend to assist her in her passage thru the state of
purification

853
6263  Your prayers are useless now, she has
passed thru the atmosphere & ascended to
the 1st Sphere.

Will my prayers now - retard her advance, or is it
advisable that I should continue my prayers for her

854
6264 They neither retard nor progress her
She is beyond their power

Can Emma this Evening have a Vision of [?]
who now resides in South America

855
6265  Mr Dresser has occupied the Erani Glass
since last Tuesday Evening

I wish you could inform me how to dismiss him

856
6266 Mr Dresser has certainly an Evil Spirit
attached to him very lately.
I felt it when he was last here.

Shall I ask him to return my Crystal - & will you
inform me how he is to rid himself of So Vexatious an
Attack'

857
6267 I so not wish you at present to drop his
acquaintance -- It would have been best
had you [better] never known him,.  and when he
Returns the Crystal be careful that you
discharge it with a very strong will

Does Mr Stuart possess the faculty of Seeing in Crystals

858
6268  he does not

[?] any members of his Family possess it

859
6269  I cannot tell
84
I regret that my friend Mr Dresser, should annoy me
so much spiritually, as from his learning religious
feeling I had expected much.

860
6270  Religion & learning are too often the Cloak
for folly and wickedness

Shall we be able to see Mr.      if I call him

861
6271  You can of Course call him but I doubt
whether he would appear.

May I ask when he will Appear

862
6271  Next Tuesday week he will appear.

My friend will attend that evening -- Can you tell me
some method of dismissing Mr. Dresser Effectually as
I do not like to use the Formula given me by Erani

863
6273  Mr Dresser has so much power to remain
thru' being a freemason, in that way he
has more power to remain than you have
to dispel him

May I ask in what manner his being a member of 
a Society like the Freemasons gives him the power
of remaining against my Will

864
6274  All persons belonging to the Society of 
Freemasons are endowed with a Supernatural
Power of Will & mind, in which the will
is more effectual than the body

Your answer as to his being a Freemason giving him
a [?] natural power of will is to me [incomp?]
The Majority of their Lodges are mere song song & drinking
clubs & their Esoteric Secrets are Nil

865
6275  It does do so

I do not like to use the Formula given me by Erani

866
6276  It is the only method of dispelling him
effectually.


pointing to his own Seal attached to the MIrror
85
may I ask if you advise me to use that formula

[*867*] In extreme cases I certainly do, because after
it is used evil spirits can effectually be
dispelled by means of this Talisman
    But unless in extreme cases I object
[*6277*] to it very much   It is playing with
the terrible powers which a portal
possesses.

Can you favor me with new information that will
tend to relieve my friend Mr Stuart from the mental
& nervous afliction under which he labors.

[*6278*] [*868*] I can

Will you please to do so

[*6279*] [*869*] I would rather give it you first that you
might give it him

I will wait your pleasure.

[*6280*] [*870*] You can send him the instructions in a
day or two in a letter.

1/2 part 9  my friend Mr Stuart left. & the CA. left the M'r.

10 to 10. Invoked the C A
The C A is here
As to Mr Stuart's Nervousness.

[*891*] It is essentially necessary to his recovery
that he should abstain from all strong
drinks   I should wish you to make a
[*6281*] copy of the Talisman I gave you for
that purpose, and give it to him
  From abstaining from Spirituous
liquors for some time, he will find his
whole system cooled & invigorated
Dr Merton
86
 It is not so much the nervous system
that is deranged, as the blood which
constitutes the life - This will be
purified.
  You will make a Copy of this

When I have so made it will you Kindly Verify it

872
6282  I will do so, but when this is done a
great deal more remains to do himself
   Every one possesses the will if they
rightly use it, of soothing themselves
indeed of Mesmerising themselves. - he
must fix his mind entirely upon one
thing   some light  or frivolous thing
that would be entirely different from
what his mind was then engaged on
   Should this prove ineffectual
he should Consult a physician,  Dr
Elliotson  I sincerely believe to be the first
physician in the world, the very first. 

As to my being a [symbol]
873
6203  I have a great objection to you being
a fellow of a [symbol] Lodge unless you
could at once become a member of
that Sacred Society of which the Fathers
are now at Jerusalem.

But can you tell me in what manner I can become
a member of that particular Society

874
6204  It is not only folly but wickedness in
joining a Lodge of a society who have no
possible good, and a great deal of 
harm for their intentions
87
Can you tell me the name of the Society whose members
are now under, or in,                         at Jerusalem

875
6285  They are Followers of the Rosy cross

By what means can I become a B.R.C

[6286] 876
6286  The Society is in France and unless you went
there and were installed as a Brother you
could not possibly become one

Are the Lodges held in Paris or where else

877
6287  Much confidence as I may have in you
I do not feel at liberty to tell the Place
of their meeting unless you intend to
become one
   Napoleon the 1st Emperor of France was
a member of that Society.

Do the [?] M. C. study the Occult Sciences

878
[6]
6288  They do after an Interview with an invisible
Poser, which they have at stated Times
the Elders by turns travel to Jerusalem
   You have seen their Place of meeting
in the Crystal - It is in the                they
they return to the rest of the Society, with
the instructions they receive from the invisible
Agent. --  upon this they act.

I presume the members must be limited to the learned
and the wealthy.

879
6289  No the the Wealthy for Jean Jacques
Rousseau was one of its firmest Supporters
[*xx*]
6290  I will show you visions that will tend to
enlighten you but in the meantime I
hope you will not join the English Lodge
88
880
6291  I wish Mr. Dresser could be persuaded to
cease to become a member

I ret'd thanks & begged one of the Visions

881
6292  It is too late now

1/2 past 10.

882
6293   I wish to say something before I leave
If you receive a letter from [B???] M. be doubly
careful that you do not answer it before
you communicate with me -- Should you deem 
it necessary call me into this mirror when 
you receive that letter, I do not say that it
will actually arrive, but it is the intention
of parties for it to do so
   Your father is more comfortable 
now than he has been for some time
indeed he is so losing his faculties that
he is becoming almost invisible to either
grief or joy
   I regret to say that his wife's
eldest daughter is fast following in her
footsteps.

I ret'd thanks [?] - & asked if the C A had any fur Comm'n
to make

883
6294  I have not

The C A's gone  20' to 11 PM.


The last vision was on the 27.h June & a few days aftds.

of headache & low fever -- which lasted two or three weeks

Called Mr Anderson
heres Mr Dresser in black frock coat, grey trousers, black
waistcoat & hat -, no spectacles
I asked him why he came but could obtain no answer
& I determ'd to dismiss him by the spell - Selina
took the Crystal & saw a little man in it extremely small
upon handing it to Emma.  She said

heres Mr Andersons Cousin.  who appeared before., in black
with lightish waistct & no hat.
Are you Mr Andersons Cousin

6296  I am, You called Mr Anderson.

I hope Mr Anderson is quite well

6297  I trust that he is  but today, now
perhaps in the thickest of an engagement
if there was any thing particular -----
------

The reading appearing so indistinct I asked him if he
would appear in my Box Mirror

6298  If you wish it I would Certainly appear
but I think it is unnecessary.

When do you think Mr A will be able to appear

6299  he will appear  some time when [it] he is
able  it is his wish that I should appear
in his stead

The Box Mirror
he is here larger.  [?] plainer & I informed him why I
charged it -- remarked I believed he was not partial
to these occult studies


91

6300  I cannot say that I should not be
fond of it but educated amongst Catholics
and brought up in that religion I have
not had the chance of investigating
it.
My cousin has had nothing to do
whereas I from my 19th year have
followed a very ------ profession

I asked him to render the answers plainer

6301 The difficulty arises from my not
being able to speak[ly] thoroly English

will you oblige me by repeating some coupled
Epigram or line of some Spanish poet, it would
greatly interest & oblige me

No answers
he's going, gone,

Ada's Japan Crystal

1/4 past 8 PM. Called my own A Spirit
here you are in black (directly)
how do you do this evening

6302 I will appear in that in one minute

Box mirror
You are here.

6303 If I had been in your place I should
not have called any visions this
evening after the answer you received in 
the Mirror
92
Certainly I would not have done so had I thought
the C A would be offended

6304  He is not offended at any thing, but
of course after he said he would show
you the visions as usual after next
Tuesday Evening  he can of course have
nothing to do with those that appear
now.  they cannot be governed by him

I explained any reasons & my urgent wish not to
offend the C A. 

6305  You should not say offend, because
he forgives every thing the moment
that it is done, if he were ever offended
he must bear some resentment.

I am but a bad logician   I meant that I should
be sorry to do any thing that would displease
him.

6306  He does not even feel displeasure, he
feels grief.
Have you any thing else to say

Have you any means of knowing whether I
should go to Chepstow or not.

6307  Whether you will or not I cannot say
it is best for you not to do so
I should advise you to ask the C A's
Advice   he of course knows whether 
you will or not.

I have been much annoyed about S.H

6308  My advice seems useless
I could give you advice about something
Else.


☿die  2nd August & 3rd  4th.  5th.
     Mr Gilkes suffering from a severe attack of Tic or Neuralgia
on the left side of his face   which was much swollen was mesmerised
by me on ☿die for 3/4 of an hour without apparent relief and he
passed a sleepless night -- but on the 3rd Aug. I mes'd him for ab't
the same time & the pain entirely left him & the next [?] the
swelling had nearly subsided -
    Mr Gilkes did not show any tendency to sleep  indeed
we chatted nearly all the time  I was mes'ing him  on the
3rd & 4 nights I mes'd him as a finish & to relieve his attacks
of Spasmodic Asthma under which he has labored some
years.
    Mr. Gilkes had an Attack of Neuralgia about
3 months before which lasted several weeks & he tried the
Sea air & had a [second?] tooth pulled out without any relief.
93
What is it

6309  Neither to Mesmerise Mr Gilkes over
his friends.

Certainly I would not if it [was] is infamous either to
him or my self   Can you give me any Valid 
leason for not doing so

6310  I hope you will ask your G S. whether
you ought to do so or not.

I relived Mr Gilkes  I many say cured him of his
Attack of Neuralgia

6311  Ah.

I did it for pleasure or Vanity which you please
but certainly not for profit

6312  I didn't for a moment mean that
you would hurt yourself by what
you got from them.
   Then I hope you will drop it with
Mr Gilkes.

do you in the A.S. state believe in Astrology

6313  Yes

Can you tell me my Correct time of birth or the
exact degree ascending of the Horoscope
he's going
20' to 9 PM.

Whilst we were using the mirror  Selina inspected
The Japan Crystal & saw a little man holding out
his hand towards me but very small, afterwards
some reading but not decipherable - upon handing it
to Emma it appeared quite clear to her, but [?]

Informed him as to my having written to S.H. and also as
to Mesmerising Mr Gilkes

885
6314  You did right in both cases but I should
not advise you to try Mesmerism as a
common Remedy.

As to my accepting the offer to go to Chepstow.

886
6315  If you had the opportunity of going I
should not advise it

As to my finger (a kind of [?] on the middle Finger)

As to Emma's Health

6317  No answer

[?]S. has now been some weeks or months in England
& he has not written to me which under past Circumst'es
I think he ought in Courtesy to have done, even if it
had only been to say that he had no further interest
in the Subject, & consequently to decline any further
correspondence.  

888
6318  He is tired of a Subject which only had
interest in his eyes from [his] its novelty

Have you any communication to make to me relating
to Mr Robert Owens

889
6319  No Answer

May I ask this evening some questions relative to
the Book of Job

890
6320  Yes, From my not being able to 
Job 5 Chap. 13. verse "He taketh the wise in their own craftiness
and the counsel of the forward is carried headlong."
95
Communicate with you In some time it 
has partly destroyed that [?] which
is so necessary between us it prevents me 
for a short time from giving you answers
So long or so clear as I might wish
I will answer them now 
As to the Book of Job:
Is the Book of Job and the relations contained
therein to be deemed by us a fictitious Tale or Poem 
or is a real History Record of Facts, which took 
Place as therein stated
891 All contained in it is not true, it should
6321 rather be deemed as a Historical Novel
than as a sacred fact. 
In this book of Job which is the 18th book in our 
Protestant Bible is to us of unknown date through which 
very many conjectures have been formed concerning
it, May I ask you at what period [?]
or if the World as [Completed?] by the Jews did Job
Live or of whom was he the Contemporary. 
892 It is founded on the Sufferings and complaints
6322 of one person, the other parts are
exaggerated or altogether introduced
to set him in the Light of an example
It was written in the time of [Nimes?]
and made Holy [?] by him
When Paul in I Cor. 3-19 when quoting the book 
of Job says "For it is written "He taketh the wine in
their own craftiness" did he thereby mean to imply
that the Book of Job was a genuine and authentic composition 
of inspired authority.
Job 9 v 9 "Which maketh Arcturus Orion & Pleaides and the
chambers of the South"
Job 38. 31. Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleaides or
loose the bands of Orion?
38. 32 Canst though bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or
canst thou[g] guide Arcturus with his sons?

[*x x*] Emma here remarked
   "theres three little boys - white things, like little
children with wings which go off into shadow.

"Arcturus" Job. 38. 32. The name of a star or more probably a constellation
in the Northern Heavens. Some have supported [Jupiter symbol] and his satellites
were intended - others that this and other stars mentioned 
by Job were leading constellations of Spring & Autumn in the days
of the Patriarch          Dr Eadie

Pleaides - a cluster of stars in the neck or near the should of [Taurus symbol] appearing
about the Middle of April  they are associated with the return
of Spring the Season of "Sweet influences".          Dr [Jn?] Eadie

Orion     a constellation of about 80 stars seen in the Southern Hem'r.
about the middle of November & hence associated with cold &
frost - figuratively represented as bands which no human power
can dissolve                Ibid

Mazzaroth - supposed by some to mean the 12 Signs of the Zodiac
each of which is brought forth in its season by the wisdom
& power of God only - the Vulgate renders the term Lucifer
it is left in our version untranslated.          Ibid
96

893
6324  No he did not

May I ask to what Star or Constellation is now known
to us mortals did Job refer to as [?] & Chesel

894
6325  It is not a Star known amongst men, it
is [illustration] and known to us in the Spirit 
Languages -- xx
   Those spirits resident in Spheres up
to the highest communicate with each
other by signs the same as those
you have seen -
   If one wishes to express his sorrow
to another occasioned by a mortal, his
companion understands him by seeing
a man in tears - or his joy at the
unexpected fulfilment of a desired object
by a human being in his mortal form
entering Heaven.

Job. 1. v. 6. & 7
May I ask an explanation of this verse, am I to
view it as a fact or only as a poetical or figurative
description.

895
6326  It is only used figuratively  Evil is attracted
towards good in trying to pervert it, so
that altho Evil spirits are continually
watching the souls of men; they gather
more especially round any body of light
because the Holier a (body!) would be
the richer would be their harvest.  in
appropriating them to themselves, they are
not repulsed they are rather attracted by
goodness and Supernatural indeed must

97
that good be that could wholly [?]
them.

In this and many other passages of Scripture
when the hand is said to be used, is it to be
deemed as a figurative expression or implying that
there is an occult or magnetic force existing
in the hand.

896
6327  It means that all Power of obtaining
anything belongs to the hand, and
not only that but the hand has a 
Magical power more even than Speech.
If a blessing or a malediction [?] a strong
wish or a prayer is [?], it is effected
when the hand is extended - the right
hand I mean.  even when it would
not be when only uttered by the lips

If this is a record of real wants it is opposed to my
very limited comprehension of the Divine Goodness
that so many human beings should be thus [to]
so [?] up to Satan & so cruelly slaughtered
Burnt and crushed as here stated / of course I
do not make any reference as to the will of the
Almighty to do his pleasure with his creatures / even
as in chapter 2 verse 3 "without Cause"

897
6238  They were not it is inconsistent with
the Character of an all Merciful Judge
as taught in other parts.

Job
Is this a correct rendering of the Original, seeing there
could be no good to Job by cursing God& then dying .

898
6329  It was - & he believed that by cursing him
98
He would have revenge upon a power which
she did not believe to be Almighty 

From the Allusions made in this book I presume 
Job was a Gentile, certainly not a Jew.

899 
6330  No answer.

The whole of the          chapter is divided in the Protest't
Bible is attributed to Job, but as the verses from 11 to 
23 are in direct contradiction to all that Job has 
said before, some commentators consider that these 
verses were spoken by Zophar - seeing that Eliphaz
& Billdad had both spoken thrice.
May I ask of they were spoken by Job or [Elip] Zophar

900 
6331  By Job.

If these verses were spoken by Job are we not rather 
to consider them a summary of his friends opinions
and that he then at Verse 28 presents with his 
own opinions as a direct reply to it

901 
6332  Yes

The six chapters which intervene between Job's last
words and Gods appearance or Speech out of the 
worldwind is by many Hebrew Scholars, supposed 
not to be genuine but an interpolation of some
Jewish transcriber who wished to establish the Doctrine "of Virtue
always meeting its reward in this World"
Did they exist in the original or not.

902
6333  They did.

But we see in Every day life - Virtue [?] in the
most abject poverty.  whilst successful villainy [?]
not only riches but titles of Honor.

903
6334  Virtue has its reward so far, that poverty
or riches is as nothing to a man having


99
a clear conscience, the humble and honest
laborer who never has knowingly or
willingly injured any human being must
be more happy in his conscience and
satisfied with himself, and as he has
passed thru' life without pleasure, can
look forward to death without dread.

True there is some consolation in reflecting that 
    "[If] the poor Man May die & the Rich man Must"
But when men like the Bishop of D -- who by swindling 
the Ecclesiastical Commissioners in Eleven Years out of 
£72,000 more than he gave his word of Honor he w'd
take & thereby robbing his poorer brethren "is Enabled 
to leave a handsome fortune to each of his Children they
are able to live virtuously and die happily" whilst the Children
of the Right Rev'd Father in God's poorer brethren May be by
poverty, seduced crime and die--hopelessly -- Thus
the way that Vice not Virtue meets the reward

904
6335  One Mans Eternal damnation
is dearly bought with the riches
he leaves to his Children --

I exceedingly regret that any thing should have occurred
to sever the Unity between us  may I hope you will be
pleased to endeavor to restore it.

905
6336  It is restored in a very short time by
Communication have you any more questions

Can you tell me by what means I could ascertain
the meaning of the Inscriptions of Hieroglyphs of the
Antiquities lately found in Assyria

906
6337  A Spirit of the Sim would be able
101
Farm bailiff, Gamekeeper,  or Parkranger
that would be suitable for him.

But Mr B. would object to my leaving him,  & particularly
to go to a client.

909
6340   Will you ask him, indeed you cannot
tell the benefit that would come from it
Your own good should surely be studied
by you, before that of any other person.

But we have amongst mortals a law of Honor. & that is [?]
prevent my accepting the situation without Mr B's assent

910
6341  I shall be able to form other means more
in unison with your own feelings I trust
shortly.
   This evening I will say no more but
be convinced that throughout my only wish
has been to act for your temporal as well
as spiritual [benefit] welfare & safety

Will it be convenient to you to favor us with the prom'd
vision as to the S.F.R.C.

911
6342  You shall have a vision next Tuesday Evening
when I appear earlier.

6343  I shall not be able to do so this evening
I will give you all in due time

As to the Formula for [Cicses?].  (see page      )
102
last Tuesday evening you wished for a
Spiritual vision  I will give you that this
evening

I ret'd Thanks

913 
6344  At 10' past 9 the Vision will take place

Shall it be in this Mirror

914 
6345  Yes

As to the Formula (spirit raising from a [?])

915 
6346  I gave you that information once
I explained that I meant the animated figures not the
Palingenesis

916 
6347  No answer.

May I ask the nature & use of Comets, seeing their great
diversity some appearing without tails & others with Tails
like that of 1680.   100,000,000, of Miles in length, some
performing their circuit in 1200 days - 6 1/2 years - 2460 days
175 years - 575 years & others not in thousands of years

917 
6348  They are bodies of Substance, and they are
to indicate forthcoming events, they act as
messengers between the Sun & planets, as all
the planets are ruled by the Sun, that being
the Chief of them, and there existing no
immediate connection between theme if it is
necessary at times that a sign should 
be given to the World it appears as a Comet
but to the other planets it has a different 
meaning

But astronomers have calculated their returns and
divines deny their being Harbingers of Events

918 
6349  This World has many more ways of
being guided either right or wrong than
103
the other planets.  therefore it is necessary
that they should have a foreshadower of
events, and altho seen by the                  and
believed in by many of them it is not so
infinitely necessary as for the planets.

[?] astronomers have computed there are 7 million
of these bodies existing in our System  may I ask if
such a number is in any way correct.

919
6350  There is not a quarter of that number

Can you tell me my true time or the exact degree
Arising or Culminating at my birth

920
6351  No answer.  (the C A shook his head)

Have you any objection to my enquiring of a Spirit
of the Sun, as to the meaning of some of the Assyrian
Hieroglyphs & inscriptions

921
6352  I have not the least objection to give you 
the name of a Spirit of the Sun who would appear
   You would then be able to ask him 
questions concerning the Translation of the
Inscriptions
   But I should not advise you to call
him often afterwards or treat him as a
familiar spirit
   I do not with him to get on the
same footing or to hold the same place
in your esteem as myself
   For I am jealous of others even as a 
man.

I rel'd thanks & solicited his name

922
6353  his name is MOHAMED . ALI.
104
Is Mohamed Ali a spirit who ever lived on this
earth.

923
6354  No he did not, he went from one of
the planets into the Sun.

By what means did he have that name which is
so common among mortals in the East, has it any
connexion with Islamism or belief in the Koran

924
6355  It has

But these inscriptions are Several Centuries before
Christ, & still more before Mahomet, would he [be] able
to give me their correct meaning

925
6356  He would

Is there any occult or spiritual meaning in the
names of [Semirus?], Hunder Lorr, Hirschiel etc

926
6357  There is a meaning to each name which
is known to the spirit world

May I ask the meaning of the name Hunder. wh.
was formerly my Guardian Spirit

927
6358  HUNDER signifies a Spirit grown
old in adversity & Labor, as far as you
understand
   
To us it signifies (Emma here said
now theres some of those droll little figures or fairies
for tho they are more like little children than any
thing else they do not look human.  they appeared
to form a kind of ever chasing letters or words.)
Hunder who always appeared as an aged careworn
man informed me much to my surprise that he
was my G S.  in consequence of my possessing the little 
oval Crystal - which I have given to Lieut Burton - was
that really the case

928
6359  I have no doubt of it




105
Do you know if [Suat?] Burton has succeeded in
obtaining Visions by any Seer in my little Crystal or
the B K Mirror I made him.

929
6360  I have heard from one of the spirits
that Mr Burton is at the seat of War
or somewhere near it at the present time
and that he has not been very successful
with either his Crystal or Mirror

I am going to Seven Oaks for a day or two to see
Mr Robert Owen. -

930
6361  I shall be pleased if you do so
I should have much pleasure to
commune with Mr Owen himself
I wish you could see Lord Stanhope without
in any way appearing to seek him or
his favor, could he hear from yourself
Your success in these things are so much
greater than when he left England, he
would again turn his friend to them
with more eagerness than before.
   I have reason to think that you
will see him before long.

I did not seek his acquaintance in the first place
I think he has not used me courteously.  & therefore
cannot attempt to renew it.

931
6362  Is it convenient for the Vision I have
promised to appear or have you any
further questions.

We shall be but too happy to receive it
1/4 to 9 PM.
The C. A's lef & the mirror is clear

106
♂︎ die Sept'r 5th 1854
1/4 to 9 PM
The C. A Mirror

6303  The mirror is gradually darkening on the 
right side (facing E) & the C A is going, the other side
is light but its getting dark, the dark is coming
up into the light as tho mixing with it, now its
light all round a dark spot. - the dark spot is
facing me  its more square than round, it is 7
or 8 inches wide and ragged all round, now it is
changing getting dark brown or clay color,  now 
it is like the end of a square piece of earth with
gold or silver arcs in layers amongst it, such streaks
of light shining in it, on the top there is [mould?]
and sand, there appears something like thick
lime water oozing out between the layers of metal
and stone on the top of each layer, now there is
much more coming out and the top is crumbling
open & theres a lot working out at top, as it
comes up it forms into a persons head & face that
which comes out of the top, it looks so ghastly
it looks like liquid silver running into a human
form.  beginning at the head, it seems to trickle down
& form the hands & arms, even the hair, just as
tho' it ran down & then dried in the shape of a person
& there it lays like a naked human silver image
    Now theres another coat running over it
which makes it larger, & theres the nose & features
more distinct
    Now the image is rapidly changing color
getting almost black, its getting lighter, its flesh


107
color now coming creeping over it, its got feathers
flesh colored feathers all over it. Now they are all
gone into one & thats made a robe like white cambric
the Changing was most curious, now the figure is
Animated and begins to move, it moves with
convulsive starts  the head & shoulders, now the
legs convulsed, now the eyes have opened as
tho life was brought in suddenly, now its upright
standing moving its arms, it has light hair
a beautiful face, blue eyes, dark eyebrows & eyelashes
small mouth very short form set teeth. square
closed teeth. a beautiful expression on the face, nice
hands I can hardly tell the Sex. the dress is 
round the neck & falls loose down to the ancles
it looks very beautiful standing on the earth with 
the Silver ore underneath. it has put its right 
arm out straight & rather upwards & the robe's fell
up to the shoulders leaving the arm quite bare
it looks like a preacher standing there.
          Now the earth is going down & he
is going up, he rises so gently still standing, the 
earth's going down tis nearly out of sight, its
quite gone. His arm is still out there is nothing
under his feet, there's something coming all round
him, it looks like a cave of Stalectite or rather
tunnell as you can see thro' it and the further
end is very small, its getting so beautiful, theres
Eight pedestals coming out of the Wall on each 
side they are at equal distance the whole length 
they seem like brackets coming out of the Wall with
pedestals, on them something on the pedestals. the
108
branches & pedestals are like the purest Parisian marble
and the stalactites are all colors & looking as tho'
they are wet & dripping - Now theres The Children
standing upon the pedestals upon one foot &
both arms out & one foot out, in pink dresses with
pink roses round their heads they just balance
themselves on one toe on each pedestal. (they are the
children that appeared on the Balls) the figure
in white still stands at the entrance with his 
arm up.

I asked if the Figure in the Vision could speak
  
6364   Now the figure has turned round towards
you and is looking at you

May I ask your name

6365  Now the mirror is all clear once.

I asked the CA to continue the Vision
the mirror veiled (20' past 9)

932   
6366  The vision will be continued next Tuesday
Evening

did I do wrong in asking questions

933
6367  It was that which dispelled it now

9'h 30 PM.  I was preparing to call J. H. when Emma 
remarked here is some one in the mirror, it's Mr
Anderson.  he is so altered  so changed, hes copper
colored & rough 
I am afraid you have not been playing at soldiering
by your looks
109
It's the weather knocks me up, its
not what I do
How are you

We are all very well thank you, I regret to hear how 
bad you have had the Cholera in the East

6368  If they had begun fighting in the Spring
we should have had the war probably ended
with the loss of perhaps not a great many
more men than have died of disease

he's going. I requested him to stay
Have you lost your troublesome Phantom Visits

6369 Yes I am all right now thank you

do you think you will get leave of absence & come home
in the Winter

6370  Yes about the end of October

do you think the Crimea will be attacked this year 

6371   No, I do not

hes  going - Will you come regain next Tuesday Evening

Spiritualism in the West. Correspondence between the believers in the H[?] [?] in [?] + the Revd. D[???] Rice
Cincinnati, Longley Brothers Printers
[??pp]. 22. 1854
110
♂︎die 12 Sept 1854          C. A. Mirror
7.30 PM         Invoked the C. A. 
The C. A. is here.
          I am much obliged by the vision commenced
last Tuesday evening in which we feel great interest
and I have to express my regret at inadvertently causing
its disappearance thro speaking to it & questioning it 
Which [he] I will not do again but seek the explanation
from you

6374  the C A bows his head,

I have had the pleasure of passing a few days with
Mr Robert Owen, who I was pleased to find exceedingly
well in health, he requested me to return you his sincere
thanks for the favor you did him in answering his
former questions, & has this day sent me 24 more
to which he requests to be favored with your views
I [have] also went to Miss Sally Cook's.  (ES!?] former Seer
but she was not at home.-
          I have just perused an American Book written
by a [lively?] body of believers on Spirit Manifestations in which
they challenged Mr. Rice a Doctor in Divinity to discuss
two sets of Propositions   one in defence of Christian
Doctrine as understood by Protestant & other dissenting
Christians   the other propositions in defence of the views
& theorems laid down by Believers in Spirit tapping
          They are Propositions of great Interest and
I should be much gratified by learning your
views or replies to them as affording me grounds
for serious reflexion - may I request that favor

934
6375   I will answer them
As your questions from the Holy Scriptures
111
were begun and for the most part continued
in the presence of Mr Till   it would be
as well to postpone them. until he has an
opportunity for being present.

May I now ask these questions

935
6376  Yes

A
Prop. 1  The Bible is the Word of God, being a full revelation
from Him to Man.  in itself complete and never to be
either enlarged or diminished

936 
6377  It is the word of God  because it was
written by His (knowledge?) & Will and the
New Testament by His inspiration but it
is not all correct.
    The original MS was in some
places wrong, and that is much altered
Now, the material points were quite
right and now remain so.


A
Prop. 2   A Being exists, the Antagonist of God, and
All righteousness called the "Devil" Satan" Beelzebub" etc

937 
6378  A Body of Evil does exist in direct[ion]
opposition to God. That evil is the
Enemy of mankind.

A
Prop. 3   Man was at,  & sometime after his Creation
perfect in his intellectual, moral & physical Nature

938 
6379   He was perfect in his physical Nature
but his mind was undeveloped  Even as a
Child's he was to attain knowledge by
intercourse with his Creator & the rest
of Creation
112
A
Prop. 4      Man being thus perfect, he yielded to the Commands
& persuasion of the Devil, and Violated a Divine
Command, & in consequence fell from his high estate
Cursed of God, with total depravity & Eternal death.
          938          It was in his imperfection that he sinned
                           and they are wrong to suppose that one
6380                  act committed by the first man should
                           so entirely change his situation
A
Prop. 5          that God so loved man in his present fallen
condition, that He sent His only Son to die upon
the Cross, and thereby redeem man from the effect
of the Curse - this son was Jesus Christ - very God
and very man. and he together with God the
Father, and God the Holy Ghost, constitute the
Holy Trinity - the Everlasting God.
          939          that is right. By his redemption
                           the three are united and the Salvation
6381                  of Man is complete.

A
Prop. 6          Men are saved by the favor of God, thro faith
in Jesus Christ; and those dying out of his favor &
faith are heirs of Eternal death by inheritance
from the Original Progenitors of the race. and [?]
remain to all Eternity in the torments of Hell
          940          As all men are born sinful it is by the
                           Mercy of God that they are Saved.
                                   He showeth that mercy to those
6382                  that seek it - but thro the intercession
                           of his Son. He also showeth His loving
                           kindness to those who sin those and
113
altho they cannot be saved as those who are
righteous by their own merits, they are
not consigned to everlasting Punishment
they are punished for a length of time
that seems to them while in that state 
a punishment eternal, but it comes to an
end.

[Latin A underlined]
Prop. 7  After death and at some remote day in the
future - the day of general Judgment, the Souls
of Men will be arraigned, tried and a decree rendered
in each case, by virtue of which the faithful pass
into Heaven becoming Angels of light & transcendant
bliss on the one hand, and the unfaithful on the
other one Consigned to Hell.

941
6383  That is wrong because they believe that 
all spirits pass the time between death &
judgment in a state of unconsciousness
but it is not so,  A man does not enter
the Presence of his maker              as they
leave  the[y] earth, they are there to receive 
judgment. but they have all been progressing
towards good since their death, by that
time a great part of the punishment 
awarded to the [?] are over, most
of them indeed are entirely happy  then 
the gates of Paradise are unfolded & they
are Eternally & supremely blest,  Even
the best who die do not have the most
perfect bliss until that day altho they
cannot imagine a state happier than their own


114
they look forward to it with great pleasure

May I solicit your view of that passage of the 7th prop'n
which refers to the Christian belief "that the [?]
on the other hand are consigned to Hell

942
6384  There are no torments that are everlasting
Can any Christians imagine that God and
when I say that I mean the Highest of
All Angels, the Disposer of Beings, and 
the author of all Blessings & goodness
could consign those creatures that He
made with His own hands & moulded after
his own Fashion -    that he could let
them taste the blessings of life & allow
them to commit crimes in that life and
then consign them to the most Frightful
tortures forever without end -  that no
space of Time known to God, Angels
or Man should in the least relieve them
from those frightful torments.

May I now Solicit Your Views on the 7 Propositions
here laid down as forming the belief of a grat majority
of the believers in tapping writing & speaking & other
spiritual manifestations

943
6385  I have great pleasure in giving You
an answer.

B
Prop. 1  That Nature is Gods revelation, and his laws
the only infallible standard of Truth.

944
6386  They are entirely wrong in that Suppos'n
Nature entirely obeys the Laws of God, so 

115
so far it is truth, but nature of itself
is powerless, without God - it ceases to exist --
it is nothing.

B
Prop. 2  That Man is a Progressive being, becoming by a
[?] of his Nature, better, nobler, & more Godlike, and
will in time, as a race become pure & righteous.

945
6387  Mans Moral and intellectual faculties are
becoming more and more developed thro'
every  generation, but they are not getting
more Godlike - Man in his outward
and physical form is not so perfect as
when first created, he is weaker, not even
capable of sustaining life for a lengthened
period which they they did but that in
some            can be attributed to the development
of his intellectual faculties.
   The race of man will never become
perfect for while man is flesh there is
iniquity

B
Prop 3.  That "Evil" is a relative term, and originates
in the misuse of things, principles & faculties, in 
[?] [?] good; which misuse is occasioned by
ignorance or misdirection -

946
6388  Evil is a separate power in opposition to
God.   it is that in itself which misdirects
man and leads him to the abuse of
those things which were intended for his
good.  - of himself altho he never would [never]
be good - it is not in his nature to be entirely
Evil.
116
B
Prop. 4  That death is the process of transition from the
earthly to the spiritual life, that by this process,
the man is separated from the Body for ever.,
And in his spiritual form, commences his new life
possessing precisely the same mental & moral attributes
which he possessed before.

947
6389  Death is the transition from the
corporeal to the spiritual state, but in
passing from life into death, man only
loses his flesh.  the mind faculties
& desires are exactly the same as those
with which he quitted the earth, as he
loses those faculties so he loses the
perception of the things he left. and
when he has entirely lost sight of them
he then begins his progress.

B
Prop. 5  That the spirit entering the spirit world is drawn
by spiritual attraction to such society as corresponds
to his or her mental & moral condition, similes similibus
and the enjoyment of all is in just proportion to
their moral & intellectual elevation.

948
6390  When they have lost all that feeling
that binds them to [each other] earth
those that were then known to them
they can appreciate all that is within
their knowledge   but still there are
sympathies existing between them when
in the lower spheres.

B
Prop. 6  That all even the lowest, entering the spirit
world, may progress, forever rising higher in the scale

117
of being and becoming finer and Lovelier, and grander

949 
6391 They depend upon others for many things 
they progress with them  they show each other
kindness,  they have their differences of opinion
concerning things unknown to them, but when
they rise they are a perfect being in themselves
they are at peace with all because there is 
no difference of opinion, they all recognize
the same Law & they all are governed by the
same desires.

May I observe that by all   the spiritualists appear to mean the
Good that in whatever degree of sin they may die

950
6392  The Bad stop until their punishment is
over before they begin to progress - the good
Progress until they arrive at perfection
Perfection before the Judgment day is the
7th Sphere after that we know not what 
we shall be

B
Prop. 7.  That men  Women & Children from the spirit
World, may and do communicate with those on earth
and that such communication os full of good to the Race

951
6393  Spirits both good and evil but more 
especially the latter can communicate with
man before their gradual rise towards
happiness, after that they lose all
knowledge of man and therefore have no
Will or desire to communicate with them, but
when a manifestation is desired by good
though undeveloped spirits towards man, they



118
choose an appearance to the party themselves
and to them alone, by rappings or other
noises   they are never heard.
   Evil spirits and evil spirits 
alone feel themselves justified in giving
man the opportunity for deception and
imposture that will make him in the
[*? 96*] end gain the wealth of a world and love
his own Soul.

It is my intentions to write to Mr. Robert Owen with
a copy of these responses thus obtained from you
and as I believe that the Gentlemen who are the
authors of the Book are sincere in their desire to
arrive at truth  I wish also to send them your responses
in the hope that they may lead them to ponder
well on the Truths of Christianity, before they surrender
their reason blindly to Invisible infallibility

952
6394  I will give you my answer to that 
presently.  in the meantime will you 
continue your questions.

Mr Robert Owen particularly requested that I would
return you his best thanks,  not only for the answers
you were pleased to give to his propositions but for the
kind sympathy expressed in your former responses
relative to him and altho he differs with deference
from many of your views, he entertains for them the
highest respect & has written me the following letter
containing 24 theorems or propositions - to which he solicits
your kind response.


119
"Seven Oaks"   12th Sept. 1854.

"I am desirous of submitting the following to the
Crowned Angel of the 7 Sphere for his opinion of
their Truth or his corrections of their errors.
   They are the impressions which have been made
on my mind of the subjects stated
                                  Robert Owen"

1st  That the universe is an eternal existence consist'g
of space and all within it.
[*?*]
953
6395  It is not eternal "Heaven and earth
shall pass away but my lands shall
not pass away"  saith the Lord"  In the
words of the Most High we have the
distinct assurance that the universe is at his will but a
void -

2nd.  That space is illimitable
3rd.  That it is filled with the element or elements
which are the materials or material of which all
separate existances are formed

954
6396  In that he is wrong because in space
there is no materials for any thing
- space is the room in which
material may be f                space has
no limits because, the whole of creation
every thing created known & unknown
there is room for them all

4.  That this element or these elements contain
inherent unchangeable qualities

955
6397  I cannot understand what he considers
120
the nature of that element can be which 
fills all space and from which are 
created all things.

5th. That the element or elements filling the universe 
with their inherent unchangeable qualities are 
eternal and constitute Deity, or the "All in All" 
of the Universe.

956 
6398  He does not recognize the Almighty 
as a distinct & separate power from 
Nature - In that of course he 
is wrong - I cannot help remarking 
that he is too elaborate in his opinions 
strong opinions more simply expressed 
would be better understood. 

6th That the Eternal element or elements filling 
the Universe is what men mean by Nature, and 
the eternal unchanging qualities of the element or 
elements.  what they mean by God.

957
6399  Before I can distinguish the 
Truth from the error of his Arguments 
I must better understand his way 
of expressing them. 
   You must tell him in the first 
place. That he makes the first 
false steps when he recognizes Nature 
Natures God as the same power 
that they are entirely distinct 
that He created the Universe & the 
elements and 
that he rules them.
121
Be pleased to accept my thanks.  I will write to him
as You direct  Mr. Owen is a man who as you once
before kindly expressed it has  done so much  through a
lengthened life  for the benefit of his fellow men
without the hope of reward either here or hereafter.
that he is preeminently entitled to the services
of any one who may be the blessing of God be the
means of pleasing him in the path of Faith, the
more so as he has the great moral courage, boldly
to avow his belief - however opposed it may be to his
own or his friends preconceived opinions.

958
6400  That man has acted from his
childhood from an inherent sense of
right [and worth] no matter what it
was if he believed that he was right
he would probably avow it.
   That sense of right & truth has 
done a great, very great good for his 
fellow man by itself - but how much
greater good would that do when
guided by a religious sense of right
when he can do those things under the
blessing of God  how much happier
would be his feelings when he felt
that he was chosen  for a great worth
and that it was the intention of the
Almighty to give His reward accordingly

I will write to him on the Subject as I have no other
questions may I ask your advice as to writing to
the authors of the Harmonical Philosophy  I do not
122
intend unless it is your wish to write to Mr Rice as
altho as Doctor in Divinity, he had neither the Courage
to decline the Contest at once, nor to meet it honorably
in wordy [?] but indeavered to shuffle out of it
[with] by Fencing with mere Scholastic terms and
that not without perverting portions of his adversaries
remarks & blinking others.

959
6401  I wish you to write to Mr. Owen to give 
him my answer to all those questions
Express my hope that his opinions
on that subject will be changed and
after that my pleasure in answering
any questions that he may lay before
me, as also a Communion thru this
mirror with himself.
To the authors of that Pamphlet I 
should also with you to send an
[Account] answer to their questions
the same as I have give you as
speedily as possible, but do not trouble
yourself to disturb Dr Rice in his
pleasant cogitations, for Religion is
to him I believe a perfect matter of
indifference so long as it feeds his
Table and allows him to yield to
the pleasures of this Life

I ret'd thanks & asked if there was any further advice
he wished to give me

960
6402  There is  I wish you to let this
mirror remain charged for my
123
appearance until Saturday next on
Saturday Evening I shall appear in it
I have a reason for so doing I have
impregnated my Seal which you have
engraved with my Spiritual Essence
  I wish you until next Saturday
to carry it upon your person and by
so doing under the blessing of
Almighty God, I can prevent what
would otherwise happen.

I am going tomorrow to Windsor on business which is
rather urgent but I will return for the appointment

961
6403  You will take this seal with you
I have nothing more to add.
   When the vision is ended you can 
discharge that Vision but shall let it
be [dis]charged for my appearance that 
I may come when necessary, on next
Saturday Evening I will not fail to 
appear

The Vision Continued

The C. A's going - 5'


128
♂︎die  Sept 19.  1854.  7.15 PM.  C. A Mirror
Invoked the C A.
The C. A is here as usual.
I am this evening favored with the company of Dr Henry
Travis a personal friend of Mr Robert Owen's and as I
believe him to be a very courteous & candid enquirer,
altho not a believer in Spiritual Manifestations as such
is as being [?] by separate spiritual intelligences
but rather as arising from some as yet unknown
physical Law or occult force.  I am desirous of
giving him the opportunity of observing our peculiar
mode of spiritual manifestation by the mirror  may
I solicit your kind response[s] to any question he 
may make.
The C A. bows his head.

On the 12 Sept. 1740. was born at Tuefenbach in
Westphalia  Johann S Heinrich [?].  Commonly called
Stilling   he died the 2nd. April 1814. in his 77th year  fr'm
The Humble Station of a Charcoalburners Son he became
a Doctor in Philosophy Medicine & private [?] Councellor
to the Grand Duke of Baden 
   He appears thru his long life to have been possessed
of strong religious feelings - & a strenuous believer in the
Efficacy of prayer & consequently in the Doctrine of Special
[?] - he having thro' life as Goethe remarks
"an indestructible faith in God and in assistance
"flowing from him immediately delivering him out of all
"troubles & from Every Evil"  of which in his life he
gives many curious instances  He was an Illuminati
& the author of sev'l works - but his (to me) most interest
"Theory of Pneumatology in reply to the question what ought to
be believed or disbelieved concerning presentiments  visions
and apparitions according to nature [?] & scripture
by Dr. Johann Heinrich Jung-Stilling - late professor of
the universities of Heidelburg & Marsburg  &  [?] 
Counsellor to the Grand Duke of Baden --
               Translated from the German by Sam'l Jackson
                London.  Longman  12 [?] pp 469   1834

129
one is His Theory of Pneumatology in reply to the
question  what ought to be believed or disbelieved
concerning presentiments  visions  & apparitions,  this work
has been excellently translated by Sam'l Jackson
And the 5th Chapter contains a Brief Summary of
His theory & inferences from it in 55 Propositions
   Altho some of these propositions are opposed to
any present belief (thanks to your kind instruction 
they are still such as I should feel much gratified
in submitting to you for such explanation as you
may deem necessary for my Guidance in Spiritual
Knowledge.
   May I ask them this Evening

965
6417  You may.

Prop". 1  The whole creation consists solely of essential realized
Ideas of the Deity, or pronounced words of God, I call these Ideas
original existances.  No being except God knows them all, and
none is acquainted with their True real & peculiar nature.

966
6418  Gods work was not begun & finished at
the same time

Prop 2.  Amongst the infinite number of these Original
Existences, there are various classes, which are fully conscious
of themselves, form Ideas of other original existences, & possess
Reason & free will;  to these belong Spirits, Angels & Men.
Is he right in that proposition

967
6419  No he is not.
He should not class spirits  angels and 
men together - They are entirely different
except in form, & that not complete.
xx
This [?]eopome was given in A[????] to D'P[????] question
"Will [?] a please to define what we are to understand
by "Reason" ".
130
[Prop." 3.]
[*F H.*]
do spirits & angels possess reason & free will as understood
amongst mortals

968
6420 No they do not they know every thing and
act by instinct
[*xx*]  Reason is a power possessed alone by
Man.  to distinguish him from the Brute 
creation.

In what may I ask does man's free will consist in your view

969
6421  That he does a thing unbiassed by any
motive except that given him by reason

Prop: 3  We mortals are totally unacquainted with the 
Mental powers, or the faculty of imagination, thought
& judgment and the Will of other classes of rational beings
& only partially so with our own.

970
6422   In that he is right

Prop. 4  In our present Natural State we cannot attain
to any Knowledge of created things in any other way
than thro' the Medium of our five organs of Sense.

971 
6423  He is right as to the generality of people
but there are exceptions.

Prop. 5  If any change be made in our organs of sense, or 
their inward arrangement be altered, our Ideas of things
& with them our knowledge becomes different, for instance
if our Eye were otherwise formed all colors forms figures
dimensions & distances would also be different & the same
is the case with all the five senses
Is he right in that proposition
131

972 
6424  No he is not
were it possible to change the Human Eye
that would not alter Creation, it could not
see things which do not exist. neither could
it change those that do.

Prop. 6   Beings that are differently organized to ourselves,
form an entirely different idea of our world in what we do
Hence it follows incontestibly that the ideas we form of the
Creation & all the Science, & knowledge resulting from
them depend entirely upon our Organization.

973
6425  He is wrong again there.

Prop. 7.  God views every thing as it is in itself, and in
reality out Time & Space, for if he viewed things in
space, and as no space can be conceived as really
existing, unless limited; The views which God takes,
would therefore also be limited, which is impossible;
Consequently no space exists out of us in nature, but
our ideas of it arise solely from our organization

6 & 7
974
6426   Then he must allow that all beings
except the dwellers upon Earth, besides
being differently organized from them
possess a power of knowing all things.
    You can imagine space to be without
limit and the Views of God also.
    But he does limit his views to the
condition of man, and He views things
as connected with others, he views them
as a whole & then separately & unconnected
with each other
132
Prop. 8  If God viewed objects in succession & rotation, He
would exist in time, & then again be limited, Now as 
this is impossible, time is therefore also a mode of 
thinking peculiar to finite Capacities and not any 
thing true or real, But we mortals neither can nor 
ought to think otherwise than in time & space.

975
6427  Mans thoughts should not be limited 
and time was the Creation of the Almighty 
for time & space  He gave to every thing 
and during that time & space  He is 
the Master of all and exists with all 
[there is over] but after all here is over 
He still remains the same.
   Time does not affect Him neither does 
space.

Prop. 9  Animal Magnetism undeniably proves, that 
we have an inward Man, a Soul, which is constituted 
of the Divine spark, the immortal spirit, possessing 
reason & will  and of a luminous body, which is 
inseparable from it.

976
6428
[*see 134*]  The spirit and the Soul as belonging 
to the Body are distinct, and they 
are like thought[s] confined to the body 
and known only to it, having no visible 
appearance while life lasts.

Prop. 10  Light, Electric  Magnetic Galvanic Matter,
and Ether appear to be all one and the same 
body, under different modifications, This light or 
Ether is the element which connects soul & Body
133
and the spiritual & material world together.

977
6429  In that he is entirely wrong.

[*FH.*] Are they the same Imponderable Existences

978
6430  No they are separate & distinct from
each other

Prop. 11  When the Inward Man, the human soul
forsakes the Inward Sphere, where the senses operate
and merely continues the vital functions, the body
falls into an entranced state, or a profound sleep
during which the soul acts much more freely
Powerfully and actively, all its faculties are Elevated

979
6431  When in the Magnetic Sleep, the spirit 
leaves the body but the soul remains
dormant.

Prop. 12.  The more the soul is divested of the Body, the
more extensive, free, and powerful is its inward sphere 
of operation -- It has therefore no need whatever of
the body, in order to live and exist:  the latter is rather
an hindrance to it;  it is exiled into its dull & gloomy
prison because it is its medium of communication
with the visible world, of which it has need in its
present state, in order to its ennoblement & perfection

980
6432  He is quite right in the latter part of
that argument but wrong in the first
   The soul and the Body cannot be
separated while life exists

Prop. 13  The whole of these Propositions are sure
and certain inferences, which I have drawn from
134
experiments in Animal Magnetism,  these most
important experiments undeniably show that
the soul does not require the Organs of Sense, in
order to be able to see, hear, smell taste feel, in a
much more perfect state;  but with this great difference
that in such a state, it stands in much nearer
connection with the spiritual than the material
world. 

981
6433  He is wrong in his Conclusions as to
what the Human Soul is
   He regards it as a spirit, with
knowledge of all things but it really 
is a spark as it were of the Almighty's
own being given to each man that he may
with the knowledge that that soul
will have life hereafter govern his
actions by reason so that life hereafter
may be full of bliss.

[Prop?]. 14  The soul in this state, has no perception
whatever of the visible world; but if it be brought
into reciprocal connexion (rapport) with some one
who is in his natural state, and acts thru' the
medium of his corporeal senses,  for instance,
when the latter lays his hand on the pit of the 
heart of the former, it becomes conscious of the
[?] world thru him, & in him is sensible of
it.

982
6434  Were he to use the word spirit instead
of Soul that conclusion would be in
some part right
135
Prop. 15   When the Soul is in this exalted state it certainly 
exists in time, because it cannot do otherwise than think in 
succession; all finite spirits are in this situation so that 
they only reflect upon and form an idea of one thing at a 
time, but they do not live in space

983
6435   When the spirit is disembodied it has instinct 
instead of reason, it does not therefore think 
of one thing at a time, it acts upon all 
that it has the intention of doing

Prop 16  Space is merely the operation of the material 
organs of sense, out of them it has no existence, therefore 
as soon as the soul forsakes the latter, all proximity and 
distance ceases - Hence, if it stand in rapport with a 
person who is many thousand miles distant from it, it 
can impart knowledge by an inward Communication, and 
receive it from such an one, and all this as rapidly as 
thoughts follow each other.

984
6436   distance in space is the same apart from 
the Human mind, as it is beheld by man 
   The spirit when disembodied travels
that space by Electricity, but the space
thro' that does not become less.

Hence

985
6437  It cannot do so, that it can travel to that
person & commun'te with them is true, but
no information can be given & received
by the spirits of two persons disembodied
136
[*F H*]  Am I right in supposing [a] calling my ideas & thoughts
when once formed. "Things"

986
6438  You are.

Prop 17  This operation of one human being upon another
would occasion dreadful confusion in the present state
of existence, if the doors of this mystery were to be
unfolded, But the most Merciful has rendered this not
easily possible, the continued increase of knowledge in
every department, joined with an increasing falling
away from Christ, and his most Holy Religion, will
however eventually occasion these barriers to be burst &
the most Holy of Holies to be plundered, but then the
measure of iniquity will be full - Woe unto him that
publishes to the World things so sacred.

987 
6439 He is wrong again there
    By acknowledging those things
sacred, he separates them from all
spiritual knowledge that is Evil, and
in the beginning and Earlier periods the
knowledge of good & sacred supernatural
things was much greater than at present
    It will not continue to increase and
therefore it is the duty of those who receive
it and believe it to be good, to communicate
it to others whom it might benefit.

Prop. 18  When the Soul is departed from the body, it is
wherever [he] [it] it thinks to be; for us space is only
its mode of thinking, but does not exist except in its idea
it is always in the place which it represents to itself if
In this proposition Jung. no doubt had in view the remarkable relation of the "Soliline" at Philadelphia [?] 144.74.5.4 of the Theny [?].
137
if it may be there

988 
6440  He not only allows soul to be separated 
from the Body, but he makes soul and
thought one,
    He gives the Soul the Human faculties.

Prop. 19. Time being also in fact, a mere mode of thinking
and not existing in reality, the departed soul may be
susceptible of [?] things, but only in so far, as the 
Laws of the Spiritual World permit

989
6441 (No Answer)

Prop. 20   By magnetism, nervous disorders, long cont'd
efforts of the soul & by other secret means, a person who 
has a natural predisposition for it.  may in the present
life, detach his soul in a greater or less degree furnish corporeal 
organization, and in proportion as this takes place, it
comes into contact (rapport) with the world of Spirits
I call that by which it becomes susceptible of the
objects of the latter, its faculty or organ of presentiment
and its detachment from the most refined part of
the nervous system, its development.

990
6442   Substituting the word spirit for soul
    A man cannot detach his own spirit
from his body, the spirit may be sent
away by Animal Magnetism, or it may
leave of its own accord as it sometimes
does in sleep, but whilst that man is 
trying himself to send it away, all his
faculties must be alive.
    He must be exerting these
138
faculties to do that which it is most
necessary he should not do to disembody
his spirit.

I ret'd thanks,  may Dr. Frans ask some questions

991
6443   Yes

[*?F*] Is any punishment attached to errors of belief when
every effort has been used to arrive at truth.

992
6444   No there is not, because if efforts are
made to obtain correct views of religion
and they are unsuccessful in making
the mind disbelieve what it first put faith
in, that first reliance is right  and may 
be depended upon because if a man is
educated in one religion & believe in it
by compulsion, when he finds another
more congenial to his feelings he
immediately believes in it.

[*?F*]   Will the C. A please to say

993
6445   They are those feeling which cannot be
removed by argument or example.

[*?F*]    Is not the Doctrine that one man should do unto [?]
as he would be done by - the essence of Christianity.

994
6446  It is right and necessary that he should
[not] do so, but it is not one of the essential
points of Christianity that he should
do so.  Christianity without that would
not be perfect, but it would exist.

[*?F*] But Jesus said Mark 12 v 31 "Man shalt love thy
neighbor as thyself  there is none other commandment
greater than these.
139

995
6447  But that commandment is not so essential
to man's salvation as the one "Thou shalt
have no other God."

But Jesus again says John 13 v 35. "By this shall all
men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love
one to another."
   Is not that a proof that universal Brotherhood is
the distinctive mark of Christianity

996
6448  It is not so, because these have been men
who did not even believe in the existance
of a God much less in Christ, and they
have had so much love for their fellow
[men] creatures that they have worked
thro' a long life only for their good
without hope of reward.

Has Man any right to interfere with his fellow men
upon Theological matters

997
6449  He has, he can introduce his own belief
and views, to another & often with much
benefit.

But any thing whatever justify the burnings racking
& torturing inflicted by Priests upon "unbelievers"

998
6450  Nothing can justify that, For when
a doctrine has been held out & persevered
in and it makes no impression upon
[*person*] a party it should be withdrawn.

I ret Thanks

999
6451  I wish if it is his pleasure that your friend
should appoint another Evening for 
an Interview with me

Dr Travis will be with me on next Tuesday Week.
"I have received this from S H.
         R. "answer it by a very short letter declining to
                 comply with his request.

[?] to here

[?] does that fuel your wishes
[?] "   It has done so fully
140
As Dr T. wishes now to return to London.  will it be agreeable
for you to continue last Tuesdays vision at 1/2 past 
10 this evening - or on next Tuesday Evening

6452   Next Tuesday Evening
The CA's gone.   20' to 10 PM.

♂︎25 Sept. 1854                 C A Mirror
715 PM.
Invoked the C. A.
I have written to Mr R Owen with your kind responses
& also expresed my hope that they might induce him
to reinvestigate the all important subject, the Truths
of Christianity & its Consequent scheme of Redempting
does that meet your wishes  1000  "It has done so fully"

I have also received on the 20th a letter from Earl
Stanhope whose manifold engagements have prevented
him [from] writing to me before.  he has promised after
his return from Germany in about a month to visit
Croydon & Show me a Psychograph which will give
[Answers?] to questions

1001
6453  I am glad that he has written to You

I have received this from       .  shall I comply with
his request.

1002
6454  You must not, Some means must 
be found to prevent your being troubled
with so many.

I have written this letter to the Authors of the
Pamphlet.  on [?nomial] Philosophy, does it meet y'r
approval or in what shall I alter it

1003
6455  I approve of it entirely as it is

141
Is it agreeable to continue my queries from [?]
[64]56          1004       Yes.

Prop. 21 It is a divine & irreversible law that mankind
in the present state should be guided with respect to
temporal and sensible things, by just and rational
influences, the result of a sound understanding; but
with respect to those things which in an above sense
by the word of God, & in both together by divine Providence
[64]57        1005        In that he is perfectly right
Prop. 22 For as time & space can only modes of thinking
suited to the present state, but by which he can are unable
to comprehend original existences as they really are, it is
impossible that rational inferences though mathematically
just can serve to guide us into the truths of the Invisible
World when their premises are founded on modes of
thinking adapted to the Visible World - Hence [anse?] nothing
but horrid contradictions & pernicious errors; and this is 
just the Case with the rationalism of the present day, in
reference to Spiritual things.
[64]58        1006        The latter part of that observation is
                                  right.
Prop'n. 23. ----- If it be therefore a divine law
that mankind in the present state should be guided
in temporal things by reason, and in those which are
spiritual & divine solely by the Holy Scriptures, and in
both by providence, and if we ought not to know any thing
of the future except what God of his free favor reveals to
us, without our own endeavors, it is undeniably a heinous
sin, when any one seeks to develope the faculty of
Presentiment in order to learn things [f?] or remote
142
or by connexion with the Spiritual World to become
acquainted with hidden Mysteries.

1007
6459  It is wrong to use means for developing any
mysterious powers that are forbidden by
the laws of God, but there are means of
[knowing things &] foretelling things & knowing 
things belonging to other worlds consistent 
with the Holy bible
   There is no evil in developing these
to the extent of all power on earth.

Prop. 24  When a person obtains a developed organ of 
Presentiment, entirely without his own wishing or seeking
it, either through illness or other not sinful Cause
he is in a dangerous state;  for it is amazingly difficult
and requires a high degree of divine light to avoid the
abuse of a thing so extremely attractive.

1008
6460  [I cannot understand why he calls a
gift]
    When a person has that gift, & try's 
to develop it for good purposes, there is not
much danger of his going astray - It is
attractive but it is so peculiar that no
very bad, influence could work by it
24,
Prop. 25.  When a [?] enlightened falls into this state, he
attaches no [?alice] to it, on the contrary  he humbles himself
before his God, & fervently implores Wisdom & protection
against the abuse of it -- if he then comes into situations
where he thinks he may be of some service, he employs this
disease of the soul for that purpose in the fear of God --

1009
6461  I cannot understand why he calls
143

6462
I cannot understand why he calls a
gift which is given to but a few, and to
them for reasons which are known to no
one - a disease of the soul  in that of
course he is wrong.
    That a person should guard
against any evil attending that power
of course is right, but it is not necessary
for them always to be in a state of
anxiety concerning it, for the Being
that gives that power directs & controls
the use of it.
     When you have done as much 
as is in your power for preventing evil,
Spirits from taking any hold upon you
You have done sufficient.

Prop 26  When an unconverted worldly-minded man developes his
faculty of presentiment, he falls into danger of idolat[o]ry
& Sorcery  Preachers and physicians ought therefore to 
instruct the ignorant upon this important point.

1010
6463  Where they to do so it would be making too
Public a thing which at best was intended
only for a few.,  and w[h]ere they to preach
about it at all, it would be to exhort people
not to use that power - whereas that
very power itself might be intended for
their spiritual welfare & souls good

Prop. 27.  There is also another weighty reason why the development of the 
faculty of presentiment is dangerous.  for by it spirits have opportunity
of influencing the individual. presenting all kinds of images to his
mind.  and insinuating thoughts into it.  now as the whole atmosphere
144
phere is full of evil spirits and only [such?] as are partially good.  The
former being on the elert to deceive men, under the guise of angels of 
light, and the latter in error themselves: and as the soul, whilst in its
fleshly prison has not the gift of [?] the spirits, the man may be
dreadfully misled, and here is the very source of much fanaticism
heresy, and of many abominable errors

        1011       There are many evil spirits in the atmosphere
6464               and upon the earth, but they cannot
                        take the form or appear in the disguise
                        of an Angel of light
                                If Man has the power of Second
                        Sight he has also the power of discerning
                        betwixt Good and Evil spirits -
                                If knowingly he seeks the Evil
                        Spirits instead of the good he deserves
                        the Errors they may lead him into.
Prop. 28 Real presentiments, that is, when Providence causes a
man to be warned of some impending misfortune by the ministry
of angels, ought to be well distinguished from a developed organ
organ of presentiment, the former has always some suitable object
in view, the latter generally none at all..
        1012        Special providences or the forewarning by
6465                Angels is only needed by those who have not
                         the power of knowing it by a general
                         intercourse with Spirits, had all men
                         intercourse with Spirits, no Special
                         providences would be necessary
Prop. 29
145
The case is the same with the gift of prophecy.  which must 
also be clearly distinguished from a developed faculty of present- 
iment. The former has always some sublime end in view 
for the good of mankind.  whilst the latter often prognos-
ticates funerals and things of no importance.

1013
6466  He puts the same thing under two different
heads  the same power that would give a person
presentiment of things, would allow them to
Prophecy.

The boundless ether that fills the space of our solar system
is the element of spirits in which they live and move.  the
atmosphere that surrounds our earth down to its centre and
particularly the night is the abode of fallen angels and of
such human souls as die in an unconverted state.  the 
Bible calls the whole of this state Scheol and Hades.  that is
the receptacle of the dead,,

1014
6467  The space that surrounds the World is divided, one
part is the atmosphere the other Hades
    The atmosphere is inhabited by spirits
the Counterparts of Mans - and Hades is the 
Receptacle for Souls in their 2nd State.

Prop 31  Previous to the dawning of the Lords Kingdom, the
[?] shall be [?] from all evil spirits and they shall
be cast into the Mighty Abyss, which is in the Centre of the Earth

1015
6468  In that he is entirely wrong, from it he would 
lead a person to believe that the place of punishment
& the abode of Evil Spirits is in the Earth --
   It is not so  the place of punishment is beneath
the Earth & separated from it by Water
146

6469  during the Millenium all those evil spirits in
the atmosphere will be imprisoned in their own
place but after that time they will be the same
as at present -  when the end of all things comes
they will be finally destroyed, but at that 
time they will pervade all space

Are there any spirits who inhabit what we term the
bowels of the Earth

1016
6470  There are but they are entirely Evil.

[?] particularly mentions Night (or rather that portion
of the Earth which is in shadow) is darkness, as the receptacle
of evil spirits - Are evil spirits nearer man in darkness
than in light

1017
6471  Evil spirits keep a closer proximity to man
during darkness than light  therefore the
atmosphere around them is more full.

But our Earth is a sphere like an orange, not circular
& flat like a table. - how then can the abode of Evil Spirits
be permanently under the Earth

1018
6472   The Earth is round & beneath it is the same
space as above,  but under that space is a
body larger than the earth & fixed & that is
surrounded by water
Or I should make you understand better
by saying Vapor

But the Earth being circular not only rotates on its own axis
every 24 hours, but also passes in its orbit round Sun
                   miles at the rate of a           day - how does this
fixed body then remain always under the Earth.

1019
6473   The body of Earth is stationary & is only
beneath the earth once in the [?] of a Year
 Prop 32 When a man dies, the soul gradually diverts itself
of the body. and awakes in Hades. it is no longer conscious of
the visible world: the world of spirits to it appears as an
interminable glimmering space in which it can move it-
self with the rapidity of thought: and as its organ of presenti-
ment is now fully developed, it likewise sees the spirits that are
in Hades

of their former life. seek to realize those ideas: but after all
they are mere atmospheric forms. which are unable to

6485  1031  It is so in the first state
In writing to Mr Owen I meant that I would ask you to give
me some questions or other interoggatories which Mr Owen
might propound to his spirit [?] visitors to test
whether they were good or evil --

♂︎die   3rd October 1854.
The C A Mirror
7.15. PM. Invoked the C A.
I am favored this evening by the Company of Mr Owen &
Dr [Traves?] - Mr Owen requests me to thank you for
your kind responses to his former questions & requests 
the favor of your answering the following further queries

1035
[64]89   I will answer them & thank him for coming

We were sadly annoyed last Tuesday Evening by Mr.
Dressers Atm'c spirit appearing & thereby preventing our
promised vision from appearing

1036
6490   In a short time I shall be able to prevent his
appearing.

Mr Owens Questions
1st   In reply to the question so often asked "What is truth"
is it correct to reply that "Truth is always consistent
with itself and in accordance with all known facts & all
which may become known"

1037
6491  It is - but there are great truths that will
still remain unknown to Man.

2nd   Is not belief involuntary ? and is not every human
being compelled to believe according to the strongest
conviction made on the mind ?

1038
6492  Yes when a person is convinced of a thing
he can no longer disbelieve it

3rd   Is not love & hate an involuntary feeling ? are not
human beings compelled to love that which is made to
153
to be very pleasant to their feelings & to hate that
which is made to be very distasteful to their feelings?

1039
6493  No it is not
Love arises from things which appears
perfect.  Hatred from deformities
[GM.?]
No it is caused by Circumstances & actions

4th. Can there be merit or demerit rationally attributed
to individuals for their conscientious convictions?
or for their loving or hating persons or things?

1040
6494  A person should not dwell upon or
nourish hatred for any worldly things --
for their convictions they cannot be answerable

5th.  Cannot any child be easily trained to believe any
religion or any absurdity which its teachers may say is
divine truth.  and must never be doubted without risk
of Eternal torments?

1041
6495  He cannot because as he mingles with the
world he must become convinced of other 
doctrines, and besides this there is an
inherent quality in Mans Nature which
teaches him by his [nature] reason to
disbelieve in things monstrous & absurd.

If that is so, how is it that so many persons retain
Even to their dieng day their monstrous beliefs [in]
impressed upon them by their Priests - of [?]
Virgins -- [bleeding?] [?] as Crucifixes & the Legends
of Saints.

1042
6496  They believe in Miracles and that belief
is not monstrous or absurd

154
6th Cannot any infant be trained to Love goodness
Wisdom union with his fellows over the World & to have pure
Charity & Sincere Love for every one of them.
        1043        It is not in mans nature to do this, good
                         training may make him better than his fellows
                         but no soul of government or education can
6497                make him perfect as he must be if loving
                         kindness & mercy were thoroly practiced
                         by him.
7th Cannot every one be trained educated & have their
character so formed from Birth that they shall have
the greatest pleasure through life in entirely contributing
to the happiness of their fellow men & to Gods creation
to the utmost of their power. ?
        1044        Yes that may be their great object thru
6498                life.
8th Cannot new and universal conditions be now derived
& executed to compel every child from birth that shall be
borne remain within those conditions to become good
wise [united?] to his fellows & happy thru life.
        1045        It could be done in a great measure but 
6499                there would be great difficulty in keeping
                         all to that system of Education
9th. Is not the time arrived in the due order of Gods
creative process to introduce these conditions into practice
over the Earth.
        1046        It would be well now to begin any System of
6500                Education that might lead to enlighten 
                         Man & make his afterlife wiser happier
155
and better - the time has arrived and I
trust in God no opportunity will be lost

10th.  Is not the true and natural mode of forming the
human Character from birth by sensible signs as by
seeing the [signs] things to be taught and by familiar
conversation between the instructor & instructed

1047
6501  I should recommend that while the 
character of a Child is being formed, that 
it should be secluded with other children
& but few other persons and those persons
agreeing in their religion[s] and their views
of all material subjects, that his mind
should not be overchanged but gently &
pleasantly instilled with things that
it could understand according to its age
that that training should continue
until the Childs mind is so far matured
as to distinguish alone the good from the
bad in nature.
     Then he can be sent forth into the
world thoroly knowing that he has a View
of his own. on all important subjects,
then if by Argument is intercourse with 
different people he becomes convinced &
believes in things different from those he
was educated to believe, that conviction
& belief is the right one.

11.  Is there any obstacle to formidable against the
progress of mankind in goodness  Wisdom Unity & 
156
& happiness as the existing superstitions over the 
earth called Religion?

1048
6502  Without Religion no education could make 
a man wise & good, because he could not 
have even a true knowledge of Nature 
unless he believed in Natures God.
    I cannot call any religion a Superstition 
as every Sect of Religion has true believers 
& sincere Christians

does your last remark apply to those good men 
whether Musselmen   Hindoos  Brahmins or Buddhists 
who convinced of the Truth[s] of their respective creeds 
live piously & are of good moral Character.

1409 
6503  Those men I call Christians because 
thro the death of Christ they will be 
Saved everlastingly.

12th. passed

13. Does not true and undefiled religion consist
in a never ceasing desire & action to promote the 
happiness of man and of all created life to the extent 
of the knowledge & power given to the individual by 
the Creator.

1050 
6504   That is a part of true religion but not 
the Vital part.

May I not ask what is the Vital part.

1051,
6505  A belief in the Almighty power of God 
and in the death of his Son.

Are the powers of God unlimited 

1052
 6506  He is Almighty
157
14th.  Does not the happiness of man & of all created
life depend upon the goodness, wisdom & power of God.

1053
6307  "and mercy of God"

What is the Criterion, to us mortals, of Good & Evil
that they may be known as such.

1054
6508  It may be so distinguished but the
greatest goodness & the Worst Evil does not
consist in that.

May I ask in what it does consist

1055
6509  The greatest good consists in saving by 
the direction of Gods Word & under the 
blessings of a Special providence the
soul or souls of your fellow men as well
as your own.
    The Greatest Evil is blaspheming 
the Holy Ghost & willingly & knowingly
directing others to misery & Torture.

If Mr Owen takes hold of my Seers hand will it
be agreeable to you to favor him with such inf'n
or advice as you may deem fitting

1056
6510  Since I told you I had something to say
Personally to Mr Owen, he has become 
enlightened on those points which I
wished to explain.
    Any question on those points he
may wish to ask I will answer but I
look on Mr Owen as one greater than many
of his Fellow Mortals -- as one destined
by Almighty God to atchieve a great
158
end - I look upon him as a sincere 
Christian altho not a believer in the Cross 
He will meet his Reward.

The Doctrine of Rewards Mr Owen says is opposed 
entirely to his views  =  man not being entitled to 
a reward for doing his duty to his fellow men.

1057
6571  But if he believes in a life hereafter 
he must hope for happiness, and having 
that would be a reward for his goodness 
here while on Earth.

As Mr Owen is desirous of returning to London he begs 
[?] Dr Travis that you will accept their best thanks 
the C. A.'s going 
1/4 to 9.  PM.

♂︎die.  10 Oct. 1854. C. A Mirror
Invoked  the C A. 
7h 15 PM.  The C A is here as usual.
May I combine this Ev'g my queries from J. H. [Ewing?].

1058 
6572  Yes.

Prop. 42  Every one ought therefore to divest himself betimes - and 
the sooner the better, of all atachment to earthly things: and 
should any thing occur to him in his departing, that ought 
still to be done or arranged. and which it is no longer possible 
to do, let him commit the affair to Him, who can make good 
every thing, and continue in this confidence even after death 
for his return and reappearing is contrary to the divine order 
There may, however, be exceptions to this rule : and it is an
159
indispensable duty for those to whom a spirit appears, to treat 
and inform it better. with seriousness and charity

1059
6573   That is quite true

Prop 43. We can learn nothing from spirits that are still in 
Hades. for they know nothing more than we do. except 
that they are further into futurity : but this we ought not 
to know. besides this they may err, and woefully deceive 
we ought therefore by all means. seek to avoid intercourse 
with them spirits in a state of perfect bliss, or such as are 
really damned, never appear"

1060 
6574   Instances have occurred on which the Highest 
Spirits have appeared to Man but it is not 
generally the case.

Prop 44  Every man has one or more guardian spirits about 
him: these are good angels, and perhaps also the departed 
souls of good men, children are attended solely 
by good spirits: but as the individual gradually inclines 
to evil, evil spirits approach him, the good however do 
not forsake him on this account, until they see that he 
is burdened in sin, and become entirely reprobate: 
they then depart from him, and leave him to his 
awful fate."

1061 
6375 He speaks of Evil as an inherent quality 
to which Evil spirits are attached. 
Whereas it is the Evil Spirit taking possession 
of the Man that causes his fall 

Have not good spirits the power to prevent Evil Spirits thus 
possessing man
160

1062 
6576 I n most cases they have. 
The souls of deceased mortals are never the 
guardians of man.

Prop 45 As the individual turns from evil to good the good 
spirits draw near him with great delight: and the more 
he increases in faith and satisfaction, the mor active 
and benefical do they become.  good spirits have power 
over evil spirits: but the will of man is free: if it incline 
to evil the good cannot help him, we ought not to seek 
intercourse with guardian spirits, for we are no where 
refered to them"

1063 
6517  However Evil a man may be it does not 
hinder the good spirit from trying to prevent 
it.
    He is always fighting with the Evil Spirit 
for the possession of mans soul.
     It depends upon that mans actions 
which shall gain.

Will you favor me with your view of the latter part of 
the Theorem. "We ought not to seek intercourse with 
Guardian Spirits  for we are nowhere refered to them.

1064 
6378   He is there quite wrong. 
No reference is made to it in scripture 
because it is not necessary. 
In the first place there are so few people who 
can hold communion with their guardian 
spirits. 
In the 2d it is not essentially necessary for 
the souls salvation
161

But there is nothing in Scripture --- a 
Mans - (privilege?) is speaks against 
it

There are passages where death is decreed to those who consult 
Wizards or have familiar spirits - but they allude only 
I presume to Evil Spirits & evil purposes

1065 
[65]19  They do.

Prop 46 The sleep of the soul, or that state in which the 
soul is supposed to rest in unconsciousness and inactivity 
from death till the resurrection at the last day, 
has no foundation in scripture, but merely in the 
erroneous idea, that that that the soul necessarily requires 
its body in order to act, but as magnetic experiments, 
and the apparitions of spirits incontestibly prove the 
contrary, the sleep of the soul is an error and entirely 
out of the question.

1866 
[63]21  He is perfectly Correct.

Prop. 47 It is an evident and manifest truth that the 
soul when delivered from the body, acts more powerfully 
and freely, and that its powers are much superio[u]r 
than whilst imprisoned in the body. Why then has 
the Creator exiled it into this limited and lamentable 
state. 

1067 
6321 It is not a limited state, and it is necessary 
that it should pass thro there for its 
purification. 
    The soul has not any great Power 
until it has passed through there.

The answer is easy, becuase it has fallen from that perfect 
state, in which it was created: in paradise man stood
162
connected with both the spiritual and the material
world. and was sensible of objects in both. he ate of the
fruit of the tree of life in the spiritual world, and ought to have
avoided the tree of temptation in the visible world. but he sought
to unite them both together. If eternal love had not ejected
him from paradise, and excluded him from connexion with 
the world of spirits; he would have become a devil. excuse 
this mystic interpretation: it detracts nothing from 
the truth of the relation,,

Will you favor me with your view of this heaven so mystically
given -
Not receiving any answer  I asked if I should repeat it

1068
6522  You sometimes repeat the questions &
at other times pass on.  I wish you to
follow one method.
  You can do which is most convenient 
ask a question or repeat it. Should I
not be able to answer it I will say so.

I again read the 48 Prop'n.

1069
6523  What man would have been had [?]
exten't the [?] of death is nothing
What man was to be was determined by
his Maker, had he not followed that
course all creation would have been wrong
   Man was the great Creation & Every
thing else was created for his use or pleasure.

Prop. 49.  The soul is in a state of restraint in its clothing
of skins.  its cumbersome body.  which it must sustain with
much trouble. and because of which it has much to

163
suffer, instead of being able to satisfy its hunger after 
knowledge and happiness.  the organization of its body 
deceives it with imperfect ideas, and transitory enjoyments 
which only makes its hunger the more insatiable,,

1070  6525
He takes an extremely wrong view of the soul 
throughout. whilst the soul is in the 
human body.  it is part of it.
This the reason, the knowledge, the intellect
the will - and every invisible faculty
that is possessed by man.
While confined in the body it has no
harmful longing any more than any
Christian would possess of being in a
better state.
It is happy in the body because it
has no knowledge of another state, it is
guided by belief.
He is wrong in believing that the soul
and body have different beings different
knowledge, and are always at war with 
each other, as they must be if the body loves
the earth and clings to it. and the soul
is wretched because not in a better position

[?]. 50  Here the door to thee great mystery of redemption
by Christ is unfolded.  the soul would not have been
saved even in this state.  it might have been less injured
in the world of spirits; but this did not satisfy eternal
love. which destines it to be redeemed and blest.  and



164

made more happy than it would have been had it never 
fallen: if it will now but follow and be obedient to the 
counsel of God.

1071 6525 He puts that opinion in so peculiar a shape 
that it is difficult to answer.
   Without imagining what man would have 
been he should remember what he is 
He is right in his opinion that man is 
happier thro the redemption of Christ 
than he would have been if he had not 
fallen, if he had not fallen, there would 
have been no redemption & no need for 
eternal life.

Prop 51. The Logos, the word of God, by whom the eternal, 
hidden, and almighty One manifested himself in an 
endless numerical progression and succession that is 
in [time?] became man: and by his sufferings, death 
and resurrection, made his flesh and blood a leaven 
by which, every soul that feeds upon it in true faith 
is renovated, and after being delivered from its earthly 
prison, is translated into the regained heavenly 
element, until after the resurrection, it puts on its 
original glory, and is placed in a paradise, in comparison 
with which the first was a mere shadow -

1072 6326

I agree with him in that 
He is right in his belief, that man is 
saved by the Redemption.
    Every one who believes in the Cross is 
saved. But others are saved without it 
Whatever Doctrine his opinion may seem 
to favor it is perfectly right.
165

Prop 52 From all that has been said, it is clear that 
Materialism, with its metaphysical illumination, 
is a mere, but very dangerous creature of the brain, 
a boundless and bottomless deception, superior illumination 
in the sciences and in the knowledge of 
nature, in so far as it allevates our earthly [thraldom?] 
and has influence upon our progress to perfection 
is laudable and useful, but with respect to that 
which is supernatural, and concerns our return 
to our eternal home, we require the superiour revealed 
light of the Word of God, and the enlightening of the Holy 
Spirit, furnished with this enlightened reason, that 
lunar orb in the darkness of this life may then point out 
the right path"

1073 6527 His sentiment is right, but not given properly. 
Magical Science should not be used 
through which any knowledge not natural 
can be gained, unless it is based upon 
Truth and goodness, & is consistent with 
the Word of God.

Prop 53 Real bliss comences first at the resurrection 
when the glorified body, fashioned after the likeness 
of Christ, shall be again united to the soul, and the 
complete man will then be organized, both for the 
glorified visible world and also for the world of spirit"

1074 6628 It is so
The soul for the first time after being 
disembodied upon earth, will take a 
material shape - It will have the 
appearance of the human body with all 
grossness all deformity removed.
166

It will be spiritual, Angelical, light even 
as air, swift as thought, transparent 
and yet have a human form. The form 
of its Creator, and nothing can be more 
lovely than that
    Angels imagine or rather know 
that to be perfection, and man has always 
the blessing of this.

Prop 54 Paridise is that part of Hades, which is appointed 
for the preparation of souls in a state of grace, it forms 
part of the third heaven (2 Cor xii.2-4) Now Christ said to 
the thief. "To day shall thou be with me in paradise" 
(Luke XXiii.43.) but Christ was in Hades, between his death 
and resurrection (1 Peter. iii.19.) and according to John 
(xx.17.) he had not ascended to his Father, immediately 
after his resurrection, he had therefore been 
in Hades, in paradise, where the vision of God 
is wanting"

1075 6527 Christ was in Hades after his resurrection 
preaching to souls then in a state of 
purification, but it is not a Paradise

Prop 55 Real damnation commences first at the resurrection: 
the resurrection germ of the body of sin will 
then be united with the soul, and the whole man 
be banished into the bottomless pit, with all the evil 
spirits, the centre of which is the lake that burneth 
with fire and brimstone, and which is in the centre 
of the body of the earth, the Lord, the merciful,
167
who is everlasting love, preserve every reader of this book
from this dreadful fate! Amen"

1076
6530  There again he shows how cruelly limited
mans views & mercy is one towards another.
     You know from my former answers
that Eternal damnation does not exist.
   There's very terrible punishment more
terrible than a human being can conceive
but it is not everlasting, but fire and
brimstone is not part of that punishment
    Fire is not a Spiritual body and
brimstone is very earthy. Then how can
that exist where things are purely
Spiritual

I ret'd Thanks   1/2 past 8 PM.
Can you favor me with any means of testing either
by questions or otherwise, whether the spirits who
rapp or write or make other spiritual manifestations
are good or evil , so that Evil spirits may be prevented
from leading so many persons astray who have solely
the desire to attain Truth.

1077
6531  The ways of the Evil spirits are so
numerous & their powers so great that
no means can be formed of stopping them
by Tests or questions - if one place is
shut they find another opened perhaps
larger & more convenient -
    You as a man can do more under
my guidance than I can spiritually
168

Will you write a work to the Society, denounsing
their spirits as Evil, give the passages from 
your minutes and quote the Answers you 
have received in support of the doctrine 
of Truth. however short it may be, let it 
be earnest. straight forward & something 
that will compel them to answer  
   Select any thing that I have given you 
and use it in the way that you think 
best, when they have once been roused to 
attention I will deal with them.

I explained.

1078 
6532  do so and guided by truth reason justice 
& mercy on a Christian Errand you cannot 
do wrong
Rewards are not of Earth.
And remember that the intentions as well 
as the actions are indelibly written in the 
book of life - If the purpose [remain] should 
fail the intention remains unsullied.

I ret'd thanks. & ment'd that I had no further queries 
at present. Requested the Vision to be Continued

1079 
6533  Any questions you may ask however slight 
are received by me with the same attention 
as those of an old author.,  Questions
that arise spontaneously to the mind are 
agreeable to me
    Mr Dresser continuing to annoy you 
must arise from some bodily action or
169 

on his part, I have been in Communion 
with his atmospheric spirit and I find 
that he is very closely united to the body

I explained by acquaintance with that Gentleman 
& my Assurance that he would not knowingly 
do any thing to annoy me.

1080 
6534   You did not understand me  I did not 
mean that, by saying that he was 
bodily opposed to you, I meant in his 
Religions Views.

Will you endeavor to prevent his appearing

1081 
6535   it shall be done

The C A left.
9 PM

1082 
6536  To See the vision 
"do not call it now or Mr Dresser 
will appear"

We ceased action

♂︎ 17 Oct. 1854      C. A Mirror
Invoked the C A.

In any letter which I propose writing to the Harmonial Society 
It has occurred to me that if as they profess themselves to be 
they are actuated by a love of Truth alone, they must necessarily 
wish to test [the] whether their Spiritual Visitors are good or evil 
& therefore I intend after, advising them upon commencing their Circle 
just to pray to God to prevent any Evil Spirits intruding, & 
then when the rappings commence to exorcise the spirits rapping
170
rapping 3 times

1083
6537  do so it will be the surest way of testing them 
I have also thought it desirable - that some magical Circle 
Triangle or Pentacle - should be drawn upon the Table within 
which none but good & helpful spirits could rap, can 
you give me the form of such Circle or pentacle

1084 
6538   That would be of no use  Evil Spirits are so 
deep that the rappists not being visible 
would as easily rap on the outside as in 
the middle & the distinction of sound 
would not be heard.

There is a tradition long handed down amongst Cabalists 
& others, that Spirits cannot address a mortal first =
is that the case

1085 
6539   it is not.

I have no remembrance of any Spirit addressing us 
first either in our Crystals, mirrors or Vessels of Water

1084
6540   I will do so any Evening

May I ask you to do so next Tuesday Evening

1087 
6541  I will do so

May I ask how it is that when Emma's At. Spirit 
used to appear she gave us answers far excelling any 
ability of hers to do in her natural state.  whilst my 
own At Spirit & those of some others when they appear 
do not seem to possess even as much knowledge as 
we do in the body -

1088
6542 no answer (asked twice)

Is the faculty or power of seeing in Crystals, to be attributed 
to any peculiar feature or organization of the brain or
171

a peculiar spiritual faculty

1089
6543   It is purely a spiritual cause.
In giving me the name "Mohamed Ali" as that of a 
Spirit who could explain the [Egr] Assyrian Antiquities 
you in some measure, render the truthfulness or rather 
accuracy of our responses, suspected, that name being 
a very common one among mortals who are believers in 
the Koran - may I ask by what Law or rule spirits obtain 
their names.

1090 
6544   He bears it as a name which the spirits 
who summon him may know him by 
other more common names than that 
fill the Spirit World
John, Samuel, Augustus, Evans, are amongst 
the most common.

John & Samuel are Hebrew names, Augustus an anc't
Latin one, Evans a Welsh name  were the Spirits who 
bear those names ever embodied here on earth

1091 
6545   The spirits who take those names never 
were embodied    in some cases they take 
the names of those who Guardians they 
are, in others it is not so   they take the 
name to distinguish them from others.  
it has a spiritual meaning which is 
known by Spirits alone.

Are there spirits who could & would appear able to 
translate a Latin work I might possess  say Ode's learned 
work on angels their names & offices.

1092 
6546   no answer (twice)
172
Mr Cox  a gentleman of my Acquaintance was once engaged 
with a friend inspecting the Crystal - when a very large 
book appeared - it was open & the Seer read it, it was 
so voluminous that it took the Evenings of several weeks 
to copy, can you tell me what work or book it was

1093
6547  I cannot, neither can I tell what Spirit 
showed it - to me it seems impossible 
that it could be so.

Some time ago - when you were favoring us with an 
appearance in the Crystal - you had a roll or scroll in 
your hand, which appeared partly within & partly 
occupied by drawings - Emma could not decipher it 
& it fell out of your hand remained at the bottom of 
the Crystal. May I ask to see it again

1094 
6548 It was to illustrate something that I said 
which you could not understand

Can Spirits appear in different Crystals,  ie can the same Spirit, 
appear to two persons in two different Crystals.

1095
6549   They can

Could you please to enquire the name of Robert Owen 
the philanthropists Guardian Spirit

1096
6550  I will do so

Can you tell me the name of ELL's GS.

1097
6551  No answer. (twice)

Will you tell me on another Evening

1098
6552  No answer

Why will you not tell me the name

1099
6553   No answer.

May we have the remainder of the Vision of which we 
have had two portions
173

6554 1100 You can have the continuation of it.

Will you please to prevent Mr Dresser annoying us 
this Evening

1101 6555 I cannot prevent his appearing now 
I trust he will not appear but if he does 
I cannot prevent it, I shall be able to do 
so in a short time more effectively by myself

Some time since I lent him my ES Crystal, had I 
not better obtain it from him & then drop his acquant.ce

1102 6556 Recall the Crystal as quickly as possible 
I did not before know that he had kept 
it so long but I can now understand there 
is a link by which you are joined: 
After the 1st Tuesday in Septr Mr Dresser 
shall not appear in either of your Crystals 
or mirror under any pretence whatever 
Before that time he shall be confined to 
the Evani Glass when he will insist upon 
Appearing.

Do you mean Sept. 1855 Eleven months hence

6557 1103 I do

But if we do not use the Evani Glass how are we to 
know when he appears so that I may discharge it

6558 1104 Unless they are invoked they remain 
discharged

Then shall we refrain from using it during 
that time.

1105 6559 No but should you look into it he will have 
the power of appearing, he will not appear
174

there at all times, there is no reason for 
that stopping your visions in that glass

I have now got some hazel Rods, shall my Seer
hold them in her hand.

1106 6560  You cannot see more plainly & distinct 
than you do at present.

I thank you we do see exceedingly well, but you said 
there was great Magical Virtue in Hazel Wood.

1107 6561 There is but it is in procuring Visions of a 
different Sort.

May I solicit you to inform me to what sort of Visions 
you allude.

1108 6562 They give you the advantage of Seeing 
correctly visions in which you are able 
to detect a thief, of finding hidden Gold or where Valuable articles are

Are those visions to be shown [on] in a Mirror like this 
or in a Vessel or basin of Water

1109 6563 Those Visions are so purely of a worldly 
nature that it is best they should not 
be mixed with spiritual ones I should therefore recomm.d 
a Vessel of Water.

In what way should the hazel rods be used if the Vessel 
of Water is globular

1112 6564 The hazel Rod must be broken partly asunder so that one 
end may go into the water whilst the other end is held upright 
by the Seer.

Will you give me the Call that is then used to cause 
the thief to appear

1113 6563 An earnest desire is more requisite than [are] 
a formal call
175

By what magical means are thieves compelled to return their 
spoil

6565 1114 They cannot return you the goods but show where you 
will be able to find them

Should the hazel Rods be peeled or not.

6567 1115 It should be left in its natural State 

I intend making a book of magic to keep all my more 
Occult Arcana in - [Secret? Secretorum?].

6568 1116 It will be much the best I shall then be 
able to say more than I otherwise should

As to the Formula:

6569 1117 I do. I will give it you on a favorable opportunity 

I wish again with deference to make a remark. - 
There are many of my Friends whom I esteem much 
& who also in every other relation of life would put implicit 
Trust in me, but in these matters & studies, so opposed 
to their beliefs, created in them by materialist men of 
Science & all power grasping priests - they require a 
Visible or tangible proof a proof to them which wd. 
be coming thro their Corporal Senses, but which appears 
to me, the least of all proofs for a man whose preeminence
over beasts is founded on his Reasoning Faculties - 
they would or ought to be satisfied by seeing any light 
material object say, a book or even sheet of paper 
moved at their request from one part of the room 
to another, by invisible means - and as Evil spirits 
can move Tables, nay lift them when several heavy men 
are sitting upon them to keep them down - I wished to 
to ask if good spirits actuated only by good motives
176

may not be able to afford the proof I mention 
without danger to the requester either physically or 
morally.

1118 6570 What mortal can discern where that answer
really lies.

I could give you material Evidence 
of these things that would convince even 
Mr Gilkes without their being absolutely 
Evil altho' they would be dangerous 
they would be perfectly convinced [altho 
they woul] and elated with their success 
but I should not for a moment feel justified 
in allowing any thing to take place 
however great good that may seem to do 
on which there rested the shadow of a doubt.

Man is so truly ignorant of every thing 
that takes place beyond the Material 
World, however much Science may teach 
him to believe that he cannot comprehend 
the distinction between Good & Evil.

I explained that I most wished a sheet of paper to be 
moved - not to convince myself as nothing of the kind 
however surprizing - could add to my belief - but only 
for a proof to a sceptic friend.

1119 6570 The same power that moved the apple 
to the mouth of Eve & caused the death 
of the human race, moves any substance 
or object upon Earth. No matter whether 
it be a house or a piece of paper, the 
power of making itself evident to the
177

6571 to the senses of a human being is entirely 
& unquestionably Evil

Man could see a piece of paper lifted from 
a Table & believe it simple because the 
Act [in] itself is so, but how can he tell what 
Amount of Power is required to move 
that paper or when that power is allowed 
to be near enough to do so, what advantage 
it may take of it, whilst his mind is then 
ready to be convinced of any thing that 
may occur.

If those with whom I commune 
cannot in their own mind believe I am 
what I state myself to be, they can at 
least receive the information I give them 
as tho it came from a mortal.

Let them receive that information for 
its own Value not for him who gave it

Let them give it consideration and 
I firmly trust and believe they will find 
it as consistent with their reason, as it is 
with the truth without doubt.

Any one who can propose questions 
with courtesy & calmness I am ready to 
answer, but those are indeed wrong who 
could treat so serious a matter with 
frivolity & [trifling] lightness.

Your kind response will materially aid me in my letter 
to the Harmonial Society & should only one person
178

turn from the errors of Spirit rapping teachers to the 
Path of Truth I shall be more than a 1000 times repaid

1120 6572 I am quite certain you will be repaid 
Then far more than that it will turn

My Chief deficiency [rests] arising from my unfortunate 
belief during so many years, us upon the Scheme or 
doctrine of the Atonement may I solicit at a future 
sitting your views thereof.

1121 6573 I will give them you.
[drawing of a pointing hand]
I have to congratulate you on entering 
another year of your life, and to earnestly 
pray that each succeeding one may 
bring forth prosperity & happiness.

Accept my sincere good will towards 
you and believe me as far as the power 
of a Spirit extends, and I have influence 
in the spiritual world it shall be exerted 
in your behalf both bodily & spiritually

25' to 10 PM To See the Continuation of the Vision

6574
Here is a white form no wings fairer than before, he 
is standing quite straight his arms folded in front 
its arranging the folds are getting darker theres
something purple coming toward the head and wings
are forming now it has a white robe on pink wings 
& then a purple Robe & something purple round the head 
its gone close to your side & looks at you.

Now he has got something in his hand it
179

like a ball in two halves he is taking it apart it is 
hollow in the middle. I cannot see what is in it 
he is taking something out

I inadvertently put my finger on the seal & Emma
cried its vanished instantly 

I earnestly requested the vision to be continued

1122 6575 It cannot be it is dispelled 
You must not ask Questions or exert 
your influence over it before the vision 
is finished"

1/4 to 10 PM.

Action Ended.

♂︎die 24 Oct. 1854 (Missed)

♂︎die 31 Oct. 1854 C A Mirror

8 PM Invoked the C.A.

The CA appeared as usual but very indistinct
Wd it be agreeable for me to [answer] ask some questions 
relative to my letter

6576 1123 It will

I have written the letter as directed by you may I ask 
if you are aware of its Contents

1124 6577 I know the intention but I should wish 
to hear the expression[s] as it reaches the 
eyes of man

I then read the letter & requested to be informed if any Alter.n
was requisite

1125 6578 No alteration is necessary it is entirely what 
I wished, I trust you will keep a copy of it
The Atonement
12 "/11/82

@ 6' to 9 PM.
W 10 to 9
180

by you that it may one day be published 
and distributed amongst the English

May I ask you to favor me with your remarks on the 
doctrine of the Atonement thro' J. C. that I may 
include in my letter

1126 6579 They acknowledge their belief in the 
Atonement of Christ in their propositions 

I explained that the position 5 in their paper A
was a Christian doctrine which they denied

1127 6580 He was the Essence of the Father, the 
Spirit of the Father, one with himself 
sent by Him on Earth amongst men 
in their own form to enlighten them 
according to His Word, the Body was 
Sacrificed for their Sins and the Spirit 
again returned to be one as before.

Why do these Rapping & Writing Spirits announce 
themselves as being the relatives or friends deceased of 
the members of the Circle & not as Spirits who never 
where embodied on Earth.

1128 6387 The nature of Evil Spirits is deceit, and 
were they to say what they verily are, they 
would be for the time honest, besides by 
declaring themselves their relatives & friends 
they claim their Attention more readily 
than if they were to make themselves known 
by a Strange name.

May I ask how they become Acquainted with the 
names, manner & place of Death of those deceased friends

1129 6582 The Knowledge of the Evil Spirits is almost
181

boundless so far as concerns mortals or 
Spirits of low degree.

If questions were proposed to those 
Spirits such as this:

"Are there a number of Ministering 
Angels who have never been embodied 
constantly in the presence of God 
His Son and the Holy Ghost 
interceding for mans Eternal 
happiness & Welfare" 

they would shortly deny it.

But as the great majority of the believers in the Spirit 
rappers & writers, deny the inspiration of the Scriptures 
& the Divinity of Christ, such a question so denied
would only increase their disbelief, contrary to the 
intention of my letter.

1130 6583 I trust you will send it as quickly 
as possible.

My Seers Vision being this Evening very imperfect - (thro
our having had some unpleasant words the previous day 
[?]) I requested the CA to appear again next 
Tuesday Evening

1684 1131 I will

9 PM. Action Ended.
182

♂︎die 7 Nov. 1854 C A Mirror

8 PM. Invoked the C A

As to my letter to the Harmonial Socy. Cincinnati

1132 6585 I am quite satisfied with what you have said 
and believe it to be sufficient

Shall I take out the words "Mammon loving Priests"

6586 1133 do not alter a word

Can we this Evg. see the Continuation of the vision I so 
unfortunately dispelled - see Rx 6574

6587 1134 I cannot show you that one this Evening 

Do not the entrance of so many human souls, into 
the Spirit world cause a great commotion therein

6588 1135 It does indeed

Notwithstanding the responses you have favored me with 
I still without my mawkish sentimentality, think 
that it would be much better for our race & its improve.t 
if Nicholas or any other royal Miscreant who wages an
Unjust War, was taken off by a fit of apoplexy. than
have so many thousands, not merely slain in battle 
but lingering in misery & pain, & ultimately doomed to 
live a burthen to themselves & those around them. 

1136 6589 You doubt the Justice & mercy of God because 
his ways & workings are unknown to you.

We put earnest confidence in the working 
out of His Divine wishes, and can only 
say of that which appears to us inexplicable 
"Thy Will be done"

But Christian priests whether Greek Roman or Protestant 
are ever ready at the bidding of the Governments to offer 
up Te Deums, & often for the same Battle.

6590 1137 Those prayers are unheeded by Him.
183
I know your objections to my asking of you questions
relating to [T?], but may I ask if our Arms will
be Successful in the Crimea
6591        1138        It will do so
May I ask if any of Sir John Franklin's Crew are alive
6592        1138        They have all perished
May I ask when Sir John Franklin died
        1140                He died a short time before you saw the
6593                        Vision of his Grave in the Crystal
                                 Eight of his crew were then alive
Can you tell me the Latitude and Longitude of the place
where he died
6594        1141        I cannot tell that.
May I ask you in what consists the vital principle
or Life in Man.
        1142                "I am"
6595                        Life is in the blood, and the action of
                                 the blood upon the body generates all
                                 diseases. -
But man may be killed instantaneously as by gasses
or a concussion
                1143        It is something beside the Spirit the soul
6396                        is distinct from the Body, the Spirit
                                 Animates the body but when the body dies
                                 the Spirit does not cease to exist.
Is that alluded to by                 as our having a Corporeal
body & also a Spiritual body
6597        1144        Allusions are made to it
May I ask in what part of the New Testament, Jesus
or his disciples alluded to it
        /Asked three times no answer/
184
In there any thing unreasonable in that question

1145 6598 The question is not unreasonable
at the present time I am not at
liberty to answer it.

Mr Owen has sent me parts 4 + 5 of his "New Existence"
I have not yet read them, but he is desirous of having
Your opinion of them.

1146 6599 I am of opinion that they are of great
service to his cause.
I regard Mr Owen very highly and
his works are equal to himself. but in
some things he is wrong, could he but
believe in the redemption of Christ and
look for Salvation thro' his atonement
and to believe that nature owes its
existence to God, and that he is the
Supreme Ruler[s] of all things, I should
firmly believe him to be a man without
equal upon earth.

I have in my magical Mss. many Curious formula
for rendering persons invisible, is it possible such
a person exists.

1147 6660 The mans material body still remains
but he can exercise a power over others
that those laboring under that power 
Cannot see him.

Is the use of that Power Sinful when not used for
any bad purpose.

1148 6601 No it is not sinful , but he is obliged
to exert great power over his witnesses
You have formulas for making a
185
Man invisible

If I select 2 or 3 will you tell me which is best.

1149 6602 They are all correct but some more
powerful than others, I will do so,

The Formula for Cures

1150 6602 I am afraid that if I gave it you, you
would be induced from feelings of
humanity to use it. You shall have
it when it is good for you to receive it,
but I must deny you that which is at all
hurtful to yourself.

May I have a cont.n of "The Vision" next Tuesday Ev.g

6603 1151 I will show it you if it is possible

As to the F.R.C.

6604 1152 You will be acquainted with the Doctrine
of the Rosy Cross.

As to the F.M.

1153 6605 I sincerely trust that you will not do so
No man ever yet entered a Masonic
Lodge that did not bitterly repent it.

Is our friend Mr Anderson alive & well

6606 1154 He is better than he has been

Is Lieut Burton well

6607 1155 No answer

May I ask if you have any advice to favor me with

6608 1156 I have nothing this evening

When you appear next Tuesday will you as promised
speak first

6609 1157 I will do so

8. 3' pm.  The CA is here very plain, & there is some reading coming

1158 6610 You have unfortunately lost the Talisman
I gave you as a safeguard I wish you
to make another the same, and I will
Impregnate it the same as before.

I ret.d thanks.
Mr Owen requests to be informed if you are still agreeable
to  his publishing the responses you favored him with

6611 1159 I am quite so

Mr Owen has also asked me whether I prefer my name
appearing or not to the letters I wrote him, I have
personally, always around any belief in spiritual
existances & then communication by certain [?] with
Mankind, but in this case I wish to ask your 
advice.

1160 6612 The works which Mr Owen publishes are
bought chiefly by believers in spiritual 
manifestations, and therefore appearing
in his works it would not meet with
 the derision & jeering it might do if pub.d
alone and sent forth amongst the [?]
and ignorant, & nonbelieving people, under
these circumstances & with the knowledge that
you would be able to inform them better were
they to seek you out. I should strongly advise
you to conceal nothing, the letters being sent
and with them your name and address.

As to my visiting Mr Owen next week & taking Emma &
the mirror

187
do you wish to write to him before next
Tuesday.

not particularly but I will ask next Tuesday

6613 1161 I would much rather answer you then

may I ask if Lero is still Mr Henry Leas GS.

6614 1162 Yes he is

I am going to [did] Consecrate his mirror for him, shall
I ded. it to Lero or will you give me the name of
another spirit.

6615 1163 His Guardian Spirit would be best able
to take change of the mirror

Is Lero a good & truthful spirit

6616 1164 Yes but his knowledge is not very extensive

Have you any objection to my taking my seer Emma
to London to introduce her to Mr Owens seer.

6617 1165 I have not

Mr Lea has several nieces & if one of them possessed the
gift of seeing spirits in crystals Mr Lea would take her
& bring her up. can you tell me if either of them has the
Gift

6618 1166 They can all be tried

As I have been so much occupied (my time being so
limited I have no questions ready. I will observe however
that I find table moving has been practiced in China
for divination, several centuries, by the aid I presume
of evil spirits

6619 1167 It is indeed I shall be pleased to answer
questions at any time they may be formed
I wish you as quickly as possible to make
another copy of the talisman as I think
188
the benefit derived from it unspeakably
great, I have nothing to say this evening
that would benefit you

Action ended 20' to 9 PM Emma being still unwell

[Mars symbol] 21 Nov. 1854 CA Mirror
Invoked the CA
The CA is here as usual

Mr Owen & his friend proposed visiting me next Tuesday if it
will be agreeable to you I appear on that evening

6620 1168 I will do so with pleasure.

Mr Owen has written me a letter in which he states that

Can it be possible that any spirits can appear & assume
the name & appearance of Jesus Christ

6621 1169 A vision of him appeared to Swedenborg
Mr Owen is as great as he

When you say a vision of Jesus appeared to Swedenborg
& to Mr Owen do you mean that he appeared personally

6622 1170 No I do not
The vision of the spirit appeared.

May I ask what spirit you allude to

6623 1171 The likeness of the spirit of the son
of God.

If the likeness of the spirit of the Son of God appeared
to Robert Owen, would it not, or those spirits attending it
have enlightened him upon the subject of the Atonement 
& redemption of mankind thro Jesus Christ

6624 1172 His belief is much nearer to the right
path than it was at first that I firmly
believe the time will come when he will
be thoroly convinced of all the true
189
doctrines of Christianity

Are you acquainted with the spirits who Mr Owen mentions
to have been in communication with him and to have given
him such satisfactory answers.  

1173
6625  I am not

The answers you have given me as to the "Vision of the
likeness of the Spirit of the Son of God" is so startling to me
that I beg you will give me some further explanation
of its mode or reason of its appearance.

1174
6626  Great purposes are used to meet great
ends.
    If two founders of great and distinct
sects of religionists needed assurance
of things which they may doubt
nothing would be too great that
conduces to that end, under these
circumstances or for my worthy cause
the Son of God would condescend to allow
the light of his spirit to illuminate
the way of Truth.
    He who when upon earth went 
about doing good for the sake of good
and going amongst every disease that
he might heal for the sake of his
fellowmen when he was as pure in
Spirit as he is now, would assuredly
Guide right at last, the men who 
in so many instances had followed
in his path.

When you say that the likeness of the Son of God app'd
do you mean that it appeared as a ray issuing from
the Spirit of J. C. in the same manner as the likeness of


190
the man in white with the cross appeared in the
different compartments of our vision

6127 1175 It was in the same way

Will you please to impregnate the Talisman I have
made

6628 1176 It is done and I pray that it may
be effectual for every thing in which
it is needed.

May I ask some further questions on the subject of the
Redemption of mankind thro J.C.

6629 1177 Do so

Dr John Eadie says under the article atonement
The great atonement made for sin by the sacrifice of our lord
& Savior Jesus Christ constitutes the grand substantial
principle of the Christian faith, the efficacy of it is such
that the Savior tho' under the wrath of God & the condemnation
of his just Law, by faith in the atoning blood of Christ, is
brought into favor with God, is delivered from Condemnation
& made an heir of eternal life + glory -

May I ask your view of that assertion

6630 1178 It is so, every sin can be for[e]given thro
his death and intercession with the Father

1st John c2 v2
1 John 4-10
Do these two verses imply that Christ is not only the being
or agent by whom the propitiation is made but was
himself the propitiatory sacrifice

6631 1179 It does

Dr Eadie also says, Christs atonement or his obedience unto death
in the [?] of sinners the great theme of apostolic
teaching _ 1 Cor. 1.23 It has in all subsequent times been
191
the object of saving Faith, and is represented by Material
Symbols in the Ordinance of the Lords Supper, it forms
the grand Theme of Rejoicing in Heaven. (Rev. 5. 9.
May l ask if that is correct or otherwise
        1180        The Salvation of the World is a great
6632                thing, against which all others are
                         Diminutive
                        It is needless to say what rejoicing
                        & pleasure the angels look up to Jesus
                        Christ for altho amongst them, there
                        is more reverence felt for the other two
                        of the Holy Family - Jesus Christ has
                        more of their Love Gratitude & Sympathy
                        being Man Angel & Godhead by him
                        All things can be known & felt.
Dr Eadie also says
After all the vain philosophy & ingenious speculations of
men to destroy or modify this doctrine which on the one
hand reduces Sinful man to the most humbling extremity
& on the other proposes to him the most glorious salvation,
the atonement made for him, by the Self Sacrifice of Christ
remains & will forever remain the essential principle of
the Gospel, it will forever illustrate the dreadful sinfulness
of Sin, the infinite purity mercy & justice of God & the Love of
Christ which passeth knowledge
        No teacher of Divine truth to Sinful men can
build a consistent or safe system of [any] instruction on any
other Foundation than this Matthew 21 & 26 v 28, Mark 10-45
John 1-29. and 10. 10-18 - He who rejects the atonement
and tramples under foot the blood of the Son of God
can point out no way in which a Sinner can escape
"The Greatest Sin and the most grievous rebellion of that 
period was sacrificing to Goats (or Satyrs) therefore 
say the Scriptures "They shall no more offer their 
sacrifices ([Casserim?]) to Goats."

(Levit 17 v 7)

But our wise men say that the reason why expiation was 
made by the He-goats for the whole congregation was, that 
the whole congregation of Israel sinned about a Goat 
when they sold Righteous Joseph into Egypt, as it is said 
"They killed a kid of the goats and dipped the coat in 
the blood" Gen. 37.31

See More Nevochim p 287.

The Hebrew word [Hebrew letters], which is used Levit 17.7, literally 
means Goats, but is generally considered as intended to designate 
Daemons or Devils which are supposed to have been worshipped under 
the form of goats, or to have appeared under that or a similar 
form to their worshippers -

See Dr. James Tomley Note 96 to the 
More Nevochim.

"Certain Idols representing the power of the Heavens, in storms, tempests, 
rains, most probably they were in the form of [Highl] wild goats 
or of other rough Shaggy Animals
Parkhurst Lexicon

See also Schedius, De Dies Gennanis Syntag IV C1 p 489

The Satyrs, Sileni, Fauns, Pans, & Sylvani of the Romans were 
Similar Deities - Montlaucon (Antiq Explained vol 1) has 
given many representations of these figures.

the damnation of Hell

Will you favor me with your View of that opinion

1181 1133 He is too Strong on the latter part of 
that opinion, but taken as a whole 
it is Well.

The true and only path to Salvation 
of which man is able to avail himself 
is thro' the atonement of Christ - When 
he has done that he has done all 
and is perfectly assured of being Saved

But the Mercy of God would 
not allow every one to perish that has 
not the means of believing - he cannot 
be justified when he says, "who do not 
believe in the Atonement," for how many 
are there in all parts of the world who 
have not even the Knowledge of God.

It is cruel and injust to believe 
that every poor Slave ignorant African 
should perish because the light of 
Gods word was not revealed to him 
with better means of at hand 
those men would be as pure & spotless 
as any on earth

It is those who are educated & 
know that such things do exist and 
yet will not seek them out or pause to 
enquire into them, those who reckless in 
soul & body pass from life into Eternity 
without thought given to their God.

May I be allowed to observe that judging from my own 
feelings & experience, the lives of many of the Clergy their
Leviticus 16. 8-10 On the great day of the Animal Atonement - 
Two goats were brought & presented before the Lord, lots were cast 
for the goat as to which of them should be sacrificed & which of
them should be the scapegoat.
The one doomed to be a sin offering was slain & after the
High priest came out of the Holy of Holies, he lain his hands
on the head of the live goat & confessed over it the sins of the 
people, the sin laden Animal was then sent by the hand of a
fit man into the Wilderness.
"And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities
unto a Lord, not inhabited"
A common opinion is that the one goat which was slain
represented Christ dying & dead for the sin of man; and that the
other goat which lived and was [demonized?] symbolized Christ
risen and pleading for our cause
[Dcn. Eadie?]
[Cycle. Sib.?]

Leviticus 16 v. 8.
The ceremony is not so perfectly cleared up by Moses as
could be wished.
1st the goat being chosen for the Notion in preference to a 
sheep or other animal, is thought to have been with a [vice?] to root
out any veneration for that animal which the Israelites might
have imbibed in Egypt, where Pan in particular was worshipped
under that form.
As to the Casting the lots by the priest, the [earliest?] Jews
tell us that an urn was bought to the priests with two wooden
lots upon one of which was engraven "for Jehovah" upon the 
other "for Azazel"
Now Azazel is a word which has puzzled Commentators
in general, some interpreting it - a mountain near Jerusalem"
others that it was a steep precipice down which the goat was
thrown.
Rev. [Banks?]

Levit. 16. 8-10
The language in the [Duipinal?] is [previc?] & peculiar, it reads
"And Aaron shall cast lots on the two goats " one for Jehovah
and the other for Azazel". What we are to [un?] destined by Azazel
has been much disputed, the language appears to imply
the personality of Azazel...
By Azazel we are inclined to understand Satan.

"Some of the Zabii also worshipped Demons, and believed that they had
the form of goats, whence they called Demons serim (שערים) goats.
This opinion had spread throughout the world as early as the time
of Moses, since we find him saying (Levit 17..7) They shall
no more offer their sacrifices to goats."

thirst for power. Their love of Mammon, their vindictive 
Hatred of all opposed to their peculiar views, have been 
a great cause of many falling away from Christ it 
appearing to them impossible that men whom they knew 
to be learned scholars could possibly believe in the Doctrines 
they preached, when their Actions were so diametrically 
opposite.

1182 6634 The actions of those men do not lessen 
the Truth of the Doctrine which they 
profane.

Every man should be [brought] 
early brought to think & act for 
himself - not to be trained by 
prejudice or overcome by persuasion 
The Bible is free to all, it requires 
no tutor to explain the principal part 
of that.

In Leviticus the 16th. v 8

On the great day of the Atonement two goats were 
brought & presented before the Lord. "And Aaron shall 
Cast Lots on the two Goats, "one for Jehovah, one for 
Azazel." - What are we to understand by "Azazel"

6635 1883 Chief of Evil Spirits

The Protestant Bible Translate the Verse

"And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two Goats, one lot for the 
Lord, and the other Lot for the scape Goat"

The Catholic Douay Bible renders it

And casting lots upon them both, one to be offered to the Lord 
and the other to be the Emissary Goat.

6636 1184 Both translations are wrong 
The one that was loaded with the sons of 
the people was intended to take them 
back to the worker of Iniquity who 
sent them.
Judges 8-27  And Gideon made an Ephod thereof (Gold) and
                      put it in his city ephen Ophrah, and all Israel
                      went thither a whoring after it, which thing
                      became a snare unto Gideon and to his home."

Judges 17.3   And the Man Micah had an house of Gods, and
                      made an Ephod and teraphim and consecrated
                      one of his sons, who became his priest."

Judges 18.17 "And took the graven image and the Ephod
                       and the teraphim, and the molten image."
194

Dr Eadie also says, in reference hereto "The Sins of a believing 
world are taken off them and rolled back on Satan their 
[prime author] & Instigator, tho the penalty is remitted to believers 
it is not [?] remitted to him who brought them into Apostasy 
[Ruin?], the tempted are restored, but the whole punishment is seen 
to fall on the Archtempter. - Is that view correct

6637 1185 It is.

In Exodus 28.6 is a description of the Ephod, may I ask to 
what purpose it was applied

6638 1186 It was the Priests Robe

6639 1187 It was not those Jewels were made into 
a robe which was worn by the Chief Priest

Judges 8.27 
Judges 17.3 
Judges 18.7

These views seem to imply that the Ephod 
was used for the purposes of a Divining

6640 1188 Rx It was not, the robe which which was 
kept in the Court (?) and belonged to the 
Chief of the Priesthood was believed by 
them to be saved & to have power over 
those on which it was placed

6641 1190 He will answer for himself when he appears

I have an urgent reason for asking this information of you

I have discharged the ES. crystal can I know use it with 
safety.

6644 1193 You can use it but I should still 
give preference to the real Crystal

May I ask whom now the Spirit of this Crystal

6645 1194 Low has returned to it since it has been 
in the possession of Mr Dresser.

Is Low a good and Truthful spirit

6646 1195 Yes

I had asked to have dedicated it to my Seer. ELL's GS. 
had I better do so or have Low in possession

6647 1196 It is better at present to remain as it is

May be allowed to have the cont. of the Vision this Evg.

6648 1197 I cannot show it you this Evening 
I will tell you when it is possible for you

Can we see Mr. Anderson this Evening

6649 1198 I do not know whether he will appear 

have you any objection to our calling him into this Mirror

6650 1199 I have not

May I be allowed to ask, in what manner, our prayers 
are tendered acceptable to God - as in the cases of special 
[providences?] they appeared to be answered.

6651 1200 If the requested be from the believers 
in His son, Jesus Christ is the mediator 
If Roman Catholics, the Virgin Mary 
is the Mediator.

May I ask you some further questions this evening

6652 1201 I will answer you some, but I am 
compelled to leave early this evening

May I ask how long you will remain

6653 1202 I am sorry that I must leave at 8

Mr Owen, is desirous of putting my letter to him on these 
spiritual subjects - do you think it still advisable for me 
to give my name & address.

6654 1203 I firmly believe that it will do good 
and I cannot see why it should do 
more harm than the letter which was 
published in the [?].

In a former Response you said [Rome?] was as great as 
[Medenberg?], may I ask in what way you applied that 
term, as altho RO. in may Opinion Yields to no man in 
his Earnest Love for the welfare of his Fellowmen, - Yet 
[Medenberg?] was a man of great scholarship, & tradition 
& one of the first practical [chymists?] numerologists of his day

6655 1204 As great in his influence over the 
minds of his Sect.

Will it be agreeable to you for Mr Gilkes to be with us 
next Tuesday Evening

6656 1205 I have no objection to his being present

In a former vision in Sept. 1853, Emma saw the Sea full of Evil spirits, 
& you said the Thames was the abode of Evil Spirits - is that the case still

6657 1206 It is indeed

Are the Rivers that flow by all large Cities infested a like 
manner

6658 1207 Most of the Evil Spirits in them [were?] 
so many as the Thames
197

I have learned many Strange things connected with 
the Spirit World, may I ask why the Thames is so filled 
more than other rivers

6659 1208 It is the same with Evil Spirits as with 
most other things, where a favorite one 
takes up his abode great numbers 
join him, it has only been their 
abode of late years. And the horrible 
things that have been in it was the 
cause of their congregating there.

May I ask if the Chief of those Evil Spirits has a name 
& what it is

6660 1209 DIDEMONT

Is there any way to expel them

Can we see the continuation of "The Vision"

6662 1211 It would be [impudent?] to [?] 
them.

As to the Vision

6663 1212 I do not know Mr Anderson will appear 
first as you called him last Tuesday 
Evening

As I so seldom use this [?] Crystal may I ask 
who is now the Spirit of it.

6664 1213 I am not quite sure but from its 
appearance I should think it [?] 
No. I will enquire & be certain

[?] is going 1/4 to 8.

Called Mr Anderson

He is here in uniform

Good Evening Mr Anderson You are indeed a stranger we are all 
grateful at seeing you alive & well

6665 Thank you I am as well as can be 
expected as the Ladies say.

We are very happy to hear that pray where are you

6666 Within [?]shot of Sebastopol

Were you under Arrest a little while ago

6667 Very nearly arrested for [ever?] on the 5th.

Is it here that [info?] of our officers have been [cashiered?] 
for cowardice.

6668 No Answer

What is the [?] you have so much difficulty in answering 
[?] questions this Evening - You have come willingly have 
you not.

6669 At the battle of [Inkerman?] on the 5th 
I had advanced on horseback in front 
of the Column when some chap singling 
me out, took aim with a revolver, one 
bullet or perhaps two went into the Chest 
of the Horse, but instead of his falling 
on his side as most other dead horses do 
he fell on his knees, or rather feel forward 
in a heap, the consequence was that instead 
of being pitched off and rolling over, I 
continued sitting, bolt upright, with my 
legs out on each side, at the same moment 
2 or 3 bullets whizzed past in the place 
where my head had been only a moment 
before - so ludicrous was the aspect
199

I presented & so miraculous was the escape 
that the men fairly burst out laughing

We are all indeed pleased to hear of your providential 
escape, have you got rid of your phantom visitors

6670 I have and I would 10,000 times, rather 
be on one of the batteries of Sebastopol 
than alone in my room with an unearthly 
Visitor

May I ask if you have lost your power of seeing in the 
Crystal also

6671 I do not know I have not [?] used it 
since I have been here. I intend returning 
to [Marsville?] in [Sept.] Dec. I shall [?] [?] 
Visit London.

We shall be very glad to see you safe home again - I 
hope you will then be a more constant visitor in our Crystal 
I presume as the Russian favors have flown about so 
plentifully you have gained promotion in the Crimea

6672 Not yet I was promoted so early when 
so young.

Not knowing [?] might have affected you, I have been 
afraid to call you into our Crystal, so often as I could 
have asked

6673 I thought you were promised an Expn. 
of it

Yes, I have received a very lengthened Explanation but 
upon Spiritual subjects, it is so difficult to receive 
information that we can properly comprehend, that 
I have still much further information to seek.

6674 I am certain that however much knowledge 
a man may have, and commucation 
with spiritual beings, he never can 
while in the body have spirituality 
enough in him to have connexion
200

with pure spiritual bodies enough for 
them to explain & [?] the philosophy 
[education?] of the invisible world

I think that is quite true, may I ask you a question 
that will tend to prove the reality of the apparition of 
the atmospheric spirits of living persons, like yourself

6675 Cannot you prove it by any one [?]

No, I find some of my Atmospheric friends so provokingly 
troublesome, that I dislike calling any but you. I 
wish to remark that this being the 28th of Nov. 1855 & 
as we cannot by any possibility learn any news of 
the War in the Crimea in less than 10 or 12 days. 
Cannot you tell me the name of some Officer, killed 
or wounded within say 2 or 3 days.

6676 General Hamilin was wounded 
on the 28th.

He I presume is a French officer

6677 No he is I believe one of the Family 
of Sir Hamilin Williams an English 
Baronet.

Now it looks like Hamlin Williams

6678 The next time that I appear I shall 
be able to give you my name, 
Spanish political affairs which 
have so long induced me to remain in 
[?] we now settled

The Government of Isabella is settled 
so far that she is made constitutional 
queen & I can now return to the [Comt?] 
from which my [?] is banished 

[Sic?]

Our young friend Selina who as usual is very busy 
here with her needle has not yet seen her future Spouse 
which she much [?]

6679 In the human as well as the spiritual 
body I presume.
201
Pray how is [Mis?] Georgina, quite well

6680  I do not know.

I have many times wondered whether we shall ever
become acquainted in the body.

6681  Perhaps I shall get bandboxed out 
here & that will put a stop to all 
acquaintance

I think that's impossible or the [?] Visions relat'd
to you must prove spiritual illusions or delusions -

6682  Did you cast my Horoscope

I erected the figure but I never judged it, I will do
so against your next appearance in the mirror - When
will it be agreeable & safe for me to call you as I do
not like doing it without your express Sanction

6683  You can with safety call me on the 
3rd Tuesday in Dec'r.

E S wrote to me about a month since that he was
going to Germany & upon his return would [host?] me
at Croydon & show me a Psychograph which can give
Correct Answers (Spiritually) to questions.  have you ever
heard or seen any thing of the kind

6684  No indeed but I think Grand papa
S-----  will have his name in
History as the Inventor of a great many
Spiritual Instruments - if he had
flourished in the 16th & 17th centuries  he
would have been frizzled before he was
half his age for a Wizzard

I have been engaged lately in correspondence with
Robert Owen  the philantroping on Spiritual Matters

6685  I don't know him

he was celebrated about    years before you were born
as Robert Owen of [New Lanark?]

6686  I have not be in England long

202
Enough at a time to know all her
celebrated characters

I am afraid if you went to Spain & your fondness
for dabbling in the Supernatural was known - You
would stand a chance of a Frizzle

6687  No I shouldn't   my mother has
too much influence for that

This year my energies have been chiefly directed
to elucidate scriptural doctrine.  & I trust with
[much] success.

6688  That is a slight repayment for the 
time you have devoted to it.

do you think the allies will take Sebastopol before
Xmas.

6689  No, indeed I dont, the fortifications
are astounding, theres a great deal of
brag about the little we do.  but they
have as yet got the better of us.

It must be allowed you served them out at Alma
& at Inkerman

6690  Yes  when it comes to the direct battle
we gain the victory, but we lose so
many men in the meantime for our
number.

The troops must  I am afraid  suffer sadly

6691  Yes  its very bad & the weather wretched
We though a good [deal?] of a shower at
Chobham, here we sleep under a 
canvass tent when the fog is so thick
that it completely saturates every thing
around us, including ourselves,

Well I think there is no fear of the Govern't or the people
neglecting to send them all the succor they can

6692  No indeed, they are very satisfied and

203
very thankful for the comforts they 
do receive

I have been told repeatedly in explanation of the diff.y
we often find of obtaining visions of persons in America
Australia &c. that spirits do not like to cross the water
can you give me any elucidation of that curious
circumstance
6693 No I cannot

When formerly you appeared in our mirror or crystal
you have brought in other persons at our request
Can you tell me how you did so
6694 by an intercourse which atmospheric
spirits have with each other.
bodily I should have been unable 
to do so.

Have you [any] heard anything lately of the little fat
friend you fought with at Marseilles
6695 O Yes, he's no friend of mine tho

What was the little fellows name
6696 No answer

How is your friend Mr Powell
6697 You are very fond of styling my
acquaintance friends

Why from the likeness the young squeaker bore to a
Certain Gentleman I imagined you were the closest of
friends.
6698 I told you once or twice you were quite
wrong, I cannot repeat it.
(here he made a face & turned his eyes up.)

Well I don't know all
6699 You wouldn't know much if you did

Have you any other incident of the War to tell us
6700 A great deal of the baggage is still at
Constantinople

When you said on the 25th did you mean last Saturday
204
6701 I did
On the 6th Nov. I started for Constantinople
I got back again on the 16th.

What do you think Lieut Henderson will be done
to for "mislaying" the dispatches
6702 discharged doubtless & thats all

Do you think               & Mr.           will be
[?ed?] for their cowardice
6703 They will not be dismissed
An Aide de camp of the Duke of
Cambridge refused to ride at the battle
of Inkerman from the place where his
Royal Highness was to Lord Raglan
who was on an [emmince?] on the other
side of the field.--

Yes but what do you think was done
You did not let me proceed, It was
said nothing at all about & he was
absolutely allowed to call a corporal
from the ranks, mount him & send
him with the message to Lord Raglan
When he returned safe, he was applauded 
by the whole set. & will be made Serjeant
did you ever hear any thing like that

Yes Lord Alvanley bolted off the field in the Peninsular
& was merely "sent home with despatches" -- & at
our Cumberland Dragoons bolted Men officers &
all from                 into Brussels, cutting down heroically
all the poor wretches in their way but I never heard of
any of the officers getting broke for it
As Emma is suffering from the cold -- we will leave off
be pleased to accept our sincerest wishes for your safe
& happy return.
6704 Thank you it is a fond hope, God knows
whether it will be realized.
9.h15 PM Action ended
[Mars symbol] 5th Dec. 1854 CA Mirror
8 PM. Invoked the CA
The CA appeared after some delay. In white, purple robe as usual
Mr Gelkes has done me the favor of being present this ev.g, he suggests
how desirable it is that as evil spirits in America, can give & do give to the 
members of the various spirit [?] ocular & indubitable proofs of their existence & are
thereby enabled to lead the members of those circles into a firm & stedfast belief
in doctrines opposed entirely to the divinity & divine communion of Jesus Christ
it would be most desirable if good spirits would also give such secular
demonstration as would place the fact of these spiritual appearances
in mirrors beyond dispute.

1214  6705
Have you not faith enough in me, to suppose that
were ocular demonstration[s] necessary or good for
you I should have given it long before this.

I explained that it was not my wish, but that thereby good & truthful
doctrine might have an indisputable support as well as evil ones &
not rest merely upon reason & argument

1215  6706
Those persons who cannot receive the doctrines
of Christianity for the great truths alone which
they contain can never be convinced by a power
which only undeveloped spirits can use.
It is my firm determination never to give a 
proof , whilst I have a doubt of its goodness
when that is removed I would do any thing
to convince the most sceptical.
How is it possible for me after I have 
been preaching the highest & best,? doctrine
to enforce it by a demonstration which I know
to be not good, it would profane the subject
that I have before preached --
Ungodly spirits are able to do so because
they care not what mass of falsehoods they 
jumble together, they begin with doctrines
that they know to be false & they do not care
Miracles   The period at which miracles ceased in the Church has
been much disputed, they were not needed after the Church
was fully organized, and the very dispute about the period
of their cessation, seems to imply that they were gradually
withdrawn --
           The miracles of the popish church have indeed
"been lying wonders."                          Dr. John Eadie
what means they use to enforce it

Error is easily believed but the way of truth
is [clear tho di] difficult tho' clear.

I explained my idea was that as bad spirits could give and indisputable
demonstrations in support of false doctrines  it was to be regretted
that good spirits could not do so in favor of doctrines pure & good

[*6707 1216]

It is to be regretted that that power can alone be
used by ungodly spirits

May I be allowed to remark that Jesus Christ supported his doctrines
by miracles & wonders  Appealed to his works as proof of his Divine
Mission he also gave the power of making miracles to his immediate
disciples for the purpose of convincing those, whom their arguments could
not sway. -- & the clergy [?] that in the early ages of the church
the immediate successor of the apostles had the power of making
miracles - but that is problematical

[*1217*]
[*6708*]

The power of working miracles ceased with
the death of Christs apostles, to be revived when
he shall again return to judge the earth.

Special providences take place, but no miracle
is performed under his sanction, to convince his
people.

/see opposite/

[*1218*]
[*6709*]

The Father  Son and Holy Ghost are 3 persons
and one God - their influence is on all the
world, in all things & all powerful

It is not a spirit that enters individually
mens hearts and moves them.  but its a spiritual
control & influence over the whole body of the 
Human Race.

To put it in worldly sense  it is the same
as steam which issuing from a Funnel, diffuses
itself thru' the atmosphere" .aa.

Will the C A then please to explain the expressions in Scripture
"Christ in us"  "The Kingdom of God being within us" 

[*6710 1219*]

It means Christ's all pervading influence not
his spirit.
We read in the psalms.
May I ask your view of those expressions
[1220] [6711] That the Spirit of God is all pervading throughout 
the Universe:
It is the influence of Christ his power, his 
Control, if you believe that his Spirit inhabits 
everything that view must become limited 
but if one believe it is his influence, that 
can be felt in one place as well as another
In life, in the Universe, in man 
in all things Created.
I shall appear on Friday Evening 
next and I wish particularly to say something 
to you on this subject. You will understand 
my reason for not doing so now.
Upon receiving this Commn. which was quite unexpected by me 
Mr G. left us & [altho?] CA continued
9 PM.
[1221] [6712] Without having the slightest ill feeling towards 
Mr Gilkes, there seems a power existing between 
myself and him, which are continually at 
war with each other. It seems to me as tho 
when giving his opinion he keeps something 
back, as tho he was continually trying to 
discompose me & show his own greatness.
There seems a kind of quiet deceit which I 
should have rather expected from a Clergyman 
who preaches what he does not practice, than 
from a man who professes to be so simple
minded as a Quaker.
I explained that the belief in such mystic arts was opposed to all 
that men of learning & science are taught from their very cradle, that 
Mr G. sought as a Ocular proof, as upon such a metaphysical 
subject as the existence of Invisible Spiritual Intelligences, there was
No possibility of [?] the fact by mere Argument.

1222 6713 You do not understand me I feel the same 
as yourself, that no person can believe in 
any thing which his education & his mode 
of life condemns (?) they may believe the 
doctrine and receive it as tho it came from 
a book.

If they cannot believe in my presence 
without ocular demonstration they themselves 
are the only losers it is not this that I 
meant.

I meant that in giving his own 
Opinion or in asking [?] Mr Gilkes does 
not give it candidly, Mr Gilkes does not give 
the whole of his own opinion, he only gives 
the part which he thinks most in 
opposition to mine.

I intend if you allow me to go to my friend Mr Henry [Rea's?] 
with Emma, to consecrate his mirror, in the hopes of developg. 
either his wife Mrs Charlotte Rea's faculty of seeing or one of 
her nieces - in hopes that his Religious views may be 
directed in the path of truth. 

6714 1223 It does meet with my Approval, & were 
you to wish it, I would appear myself

[?] I will indeed do so.

6715 1224 I will come

Mr Owen has written to me &c

6716 1225 A moment.

Before Mr [Rea?] Earnestly Commences 
his search after truth in these mysterious 
and to man dangerous [studies] matters, he 
must be cautious that he does not run 
headlong into any thing, or rush at
conclusions, that whilst doing this he 
must not make experiments while he 
doubts their simplicity-
    That he must have no object in view
but truth and the good of his fellowman 
that he must next form his opinions 
as nearly as possible, and however much 
in error they may be they will be rectified
and made true.
    That he must govern his impatience
for the end of things, and go calmly
and patiently and with his whole heart
through it.  for these things will bear
no division.
    You can tell him this and tell him
too  it is essentially necessary that he
should strictly adhere to it -
    That he must not confound the
Atmospheric with the Angelic Spirits
and above all he must rest his faith in
God.
    Founded on this basis the structure
that he erects will never fall.

May I ask if I am to take this mirror or if Mr Lea's will
do as well.

1226
6717  It will do so.

Mr Robert Owen, whose zeal for the welfare of his fellowman
is untiring has written me  this letter, enclosing an advertism't
of two meetings to be held in London for the purpose of estab'g
"The Permanent happy existence of the Human Race or
the Commencement of the [?llennium] in 1855.  he also requests
your views thereon in all its bearings.

1227
6718  He is truly a kind and good man.  ever
ready to sacrifice his own comfort & happiness
for the welfare of others & yet receiving
6718 more happiness from the [welfare of others] 
knowledge that he has in his heart of doing 
good than those who high in the highest state 
[?] it [over?] with such lightness & contempt

Tell him it is my firm Opinion as well 
as my earnest prayer that, that meeting 
will do great good to his Cause.

That as far as possible those advertisements 
should be circulated, and they cannot fail 
to bring together a large portion of thinking 
people. Amongst them there must be those 
that will act as well as think.

He will I have no doubt before his 
arrangements are quite [?] as to the 
proceeding which he intends to take place 
on that day, again have [Communion?] with 
me on the Subject. I shall then be able 
to give him my more decided opinions 
as to what will be best.

Mr Owen has reported that he might print, the letter I wrote 
to the Harmonial Society of St Tom's, have I your sanction

6719 1228 You have indeed.

May I ask if you have any advice to favor me with

6720 1229 I have not this Evening, I will name 
an Evening soon (for the Vision) 
You will be sorry to hear that Mr Anderson 
has been wounded.

May I ask when.

May I ask if Lew will appear this Evening

6724 1233 Lew will appear

May I ask the best means of developing Mrs. Leas faculty 
of spirit seeing

6725 1234 Mrs. Charlotte Lea's power of Seeing will be 
developed by practice.

has Mrs. C Lea any guardian Spirit, separate,

6726 1235 She has not, Lew is the sole guardian of both

Can Lew be depended upon to give truthful responses on points 
of Religious Doctrine

6727 1236 He is a good and truthful Spirit but his 
Knowledge is limited

When Mrs. Lea's faculty has become developed, will other 
Spirits be allowed to appear who will instruct my friend & 
place her in the path of truth.

6728 1237 they will do so

May I solicit any advice necessary for the development 
of Mr. Leas faculty, & her powers of reading the Responses, by 
my friend Mr. Lea, when I working

6729 1238 It will be much the best for him to have 
one particular evening in the week and 
that name by his Guardian Spirit

When I first developed my Seers Vision, we were much 
annoyed by Evil Spirits appearing in our Crystals will 
Lew be able to prevent their appearing on this mirror

6930 1239 He will in a great measure be able to do so 
but it depends upon the Smoker & Seer 
living in Union of mind, any [?] 
will cause those forms to appear.

May I ask you, or, should I ask Lew, if Mrs. Lea had 
better use the Crystal or the vessel of Water, when calling 
persons to appear

6731 1240 I should wish this mirror kept for 
Spiritual Visions - the [Whipsical?] Crystal 
could be used for calling Atmospheric 
Spirits and departed Souls.
1241
   The knowledge which mesmerism gives on the influence
of body on body, and consequently of mind on mind, will 
bring about a morality we have not yet dreamed of—
and who shall disguise his nature and his acts,  when
he cannot be sure at any moment that we are free from
the Clairvoyant Eye of some one who is observing our actions
and most secret thoughts, and our whole character and
history may be  read off at any moment.

I met when visiting Mr Robert Owen with Mr Pemberton 
the author of the happy colony, were you aware of that 
gentlemans endeavours to ameliorate the condition of his 
fellowmen.

6732 1241 You mentioned him to me before, previous 
to that I was not

I have many years thought that the recorded fact of a 
man at the point of death by dreaming suddenly recollected 
every event of his life, ought contribute that great book 
of life, which is said to be opened at the last day, this 
question I have just read has also been read by Mr de [Jimey?] 
may I ask if it is a right view or not

1242 It is not right

Can, "Forgetfulness" be possible to the human Soul, or 
am I right in asserting that every Idea once formed 
by [the] any human mind can be recalled & by (The 
Formula) read by others at any distance

6733 1243 It can indeed, no part is lost, any 
thought of man from his birth to 
his death can be brought back by 
one effort of the mind.

In a short article upon the Magic Crystal in the 
Zoist Vol 7 page 18 I explained my belief that 
Swedenborg, [Ashmen?], Davis & others in the Magnetic 
Sleep, became cognizant of the "Floating Ideas", of 
Living persons - may I ask if these coexisting ideas 
exist as separate entities, or as Emanations [spiral?] or 
otherwise from the mind which give them birth in the 
last case it is easy to conceive how the mind may 
instantaneously reabsorb them, but may I ask in 
what way can the magnetic sleeper or his Spirit 
become cognizant of them.

6734 1244 They always exist in his atmospheric 
Spirit, the uniting himself with that 
Spirit brings it all back I will explain

it to you another time but not now
When I call Lero into this mirror how long may 
I detain him
[*6735 1245*] You must close your interviews 
with all spirits by a 1/4 past 9 for 
the reason I told you before.
As I am not aware how far Mrs. Lea may develop 
her faculty of reading answers, can Lero be depended 
upon for giving truthful answers to may friends 
questions upon Scriptural doctrine
[*6736 1246*] He can depend upon them
May I ask if you have any further advice to 
offer me this evening
[*6757 1247*] I have not.
How long must I wait before I call Lero
[*6738 1248*] I will leave now he will appear
directly
God bless and [?] you
The [?]'s gone
8.15 PM.
Consecrated the Mirror to Lero.
Invoked Lero
Here's some one come having a black cloak 
trimmed with silver open from the throat in front 
black hair & short, silver band round the head 
band of stones round the Waist, large white 
sleeves under the other, looks like a middle aged 
man.
May I ask your Name
[*6739*] LERO
Welcome I have dedicated this Mirror to you 
will you accept the charge & direct by your 
Councils my friend Mr Lea in the path of truth
[*15*]
[*5*]
[*6740*] I will do so and as far as I am able 
will direct his knowledge in the right 
path.
I have called you in the green Crystal a great many 
times but from the hitherto imperfect development 
of Mr Leas faculty of discerning spirits, I have not 
been able to ascertain whether you appeared or not
[*6741*] I have nearly always appeared when 
Called.
Will you favor me with the times at which you 
prefer being Called, & as my friend will punctually 
attend, may I request you kindly to assist in 
Aiding his wifes spiritual vision
[*6742*] I will do so, and I propose she shall 
inspect the mirror every Friday Evening
Any particular hour
[*6743*] The hour is no object
Would it be advisable for Mr Lea to confine this 
mirror to Spirit & Angels, and the Crystal or the 
Vessel of Water to Atmospheric Spirits & decd. persons
[*6744*] The Artificial Crystal
Are you still the spirit of that Crystal.
[*6745*] I am
Will you allow Mrs Lea to inspect the Mirror 
to develop her faculty, this Evening
[*6746*] I will
Mrs. Lea inspected but the Mirror to her was not Veiled 
Emma [Spex?].
If, Mrs Lea cannot see in a 1/4 of an hour in this 
mirror may she then inspect the Crystal for other 
Visions
[*6747*] Yes
If you are not seen in the mirror will you kindly 
appear in the Crystal
[*6748*] I will
[*16*]
[*6*]
May I solicit your advice as to the best mode of 
proceeding
[*6749*] There is no other way than inspecting 
this & using strong exhortation to appear 
on his part for a quarter of an hour 
every Friday Evening
May I request you to show me the letters that 
fastens the [?].

To what order of Spirits do you belong
[*6757*] I am one of the lowest angels of 
Hades.
The CA we all recognize as 
[*6751*] the head, he has the power of going 
into the sphere above him.
How long have you been an Angel of Hades
[*6752*] I do not understand your time
To what order of Angels did you belong before you 
entd the order IAA.
[*6753*] I was a Spirit of the Sim.
When HI or CI are in mental anxiety, I ask your 
assistance for corporeal or spiritual welfare 
will you assist them
[*6754*] I will do so as much as possible
What are your duties as the GS. of my friend & 
his wife.
[*6755*] Their Comforter, their Advocate & 
Spiritual Guardian.
May I without offence ask why you appear in 
a black dress.
[*6756*] The Color is more suited to my 
taste and pursuits than any other 
Color.
Are you Cognizant of the thoughts, of HS or CL 
or know them only when expressed.
This curious Spiritual Profession of Faith was given I presume 
in consequence of my friend [?]'s very unsettled ([?]) 
opinions
17

6757       I am aware of their thoughts when 
directed to me - in different things & I
am not

How then was it that my Seer used to have visions 
of matters which I had thought about during the 
day and afterwards forgotten.

6758      Your guardian spirit and me are
two separate beings, each has not
the same power as the other.

This now a 1/4 to 9.  May I request if you have

vision that will interest and instruct her.

6759  I will

Mr Henry Lea will call you on Friday next at

6760  I will

53' past 8 PM  The first Vision

Now the mirror is Veiled - theres a line drawn across
the top. & one down the middle, now theres a line
across the centre dividing the mirror in 5 spaces
There is leading [?] in them

6761
No 1.  "The Belief and Sentiments of Lero"
I am directed by the C A. to show you my
opinion and firm belief on an essential
subject of Salvation.  

6762
No 2.  I believe in three persons and one God
Father, Son and Holy Ghost.  
I recognize the Father as Creator and
Sole director of the Universe & all

Son Jesus Christ is the one most
essentially necessary for the Salvation
of Mankind — the Holy Ghost is
the Comforter. the spirit emanating
from the two combined. who together
with them form the Supreme [b]Being .
No 3
6763
I believe a man is rewarded or punished
According to his merits or demerits
while on Earth .
That no punishment however great
while it lasts , is everlasting, but
punishment for all sins is shortened
and finally ended through the
mediation of Jesus Christ and for the
Roman Catholics , thro' the blessed 
Virgin .
Christs death upon the Cross
and his death only, is the means
by which mankind is finally saved
from destruction.
No. 4
6764
I believe that it is wrong to try to
reveal those secrets of [??tmity] which
are purposely hidden from mans
knowledge. All visible spiritual
Communications are ungodly, and that
bad spirits only use the means to
deceive man.—
That Spiritual knowledge
which induces man to seek for
Truth and reveals ++++ opinions
which coincide with those given in
the Word of God is the right and
Isaiah 2. v19
"And they shall go into the holes of the Rocks, and into the
Caves of the earth, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory
of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly

No 5.  And finally to state my opinion that the
Millenium is near at hand, that after that
Jesus Christ will appear to those upon earth
and the day of Judgment is at hand.
    The blessing of one religion will then

9.15 PM. Action ended

♂︎die 12th Dec. 1854.  7 30 PM  C A Mirror
6766     Invoked the C A.

I returned thanks for the C A's appearing at my friend
H Lea's & asked if he had any further advice to give thereon

1249
6767   I have nothing more at present.

I informed him of Mr G C B's proposal & asked if it met
his approval

1250
6768  it does fully and I am very happy to hear it

Mr Owen is about to publish my letters to him & also thy
letter to the Harmonical Society of St Louis Cincinnati in
part 6 of his memoirs

1251
6769  I am very glad that it will so soon go out
into the World

When you mention that the New Testament was written
by Inspiration  what am I to understand by that term.

1252
6770   It was the influence of the almighty that
caused their hand to write.
see [?] wedenboy

No atne

10

But were their hands guided, as in the present day 
writing mediums are by Spirits, or were the facts revealed 
to man, and left to be clothed by them in their own 
language & Style

1253 
6771 In some places it is his own Language 
but in most places it is the apostles 
following out the Ideas instilled into 
their minds by him.

I have here a small book Containing all the words in 
the New Testament spoken by Our Lord, were they really 
so spoken, or what, the apostle presumed.

1254
6772  Those are the words He himself used 

If Mr [WG?] Dresser or Mr Gilkes asked a verse from the 
Greek Testament, would you be able to explain its 
meaning to us in English

1255
6773  I would do so to a Greek 
Or in Spanish to a Spaniard 
or in Roman to a Roman
but I will not answer in Greek, questions 
to an Englishman because I believe it 
only ------

As Mr GSG cannot attend for some weeks may I 
recommence my questions from the Old & New Test't.

1256
6774  Yes, I will answer them.

I hope you do not imagine my questions are asked 
from any want of faith in you, - but that I ask 
them for the purpose of giving a philosophic answer 
to the questions of candid  enquirers & for the purpose 
of extending my own knowledge upon spiritual 
Matters.

1257
6775   I understand your motive perfectly - 
Every language on earth is the same 
to me who reads the thoughts & wishes
11
rather than the letters by which they are 
made known.

Your responses so kindly & readily given, my seer tells 
me appear as tho printed in our type, & even punctuated 
as used by mortals. May I ask if you seek in my 
Seers brain for the letters & words which form the answers 
or can you inform me by what means the answers 
are so given.

1258 
6776  If a Greek or any other native of the Earth 
asked me a question in their own Language 
I should answer it in the same.
    I should know instantly if I ans'd
[*Latin*] in Roman that he could not understand it 
and it appears to me absurd to give to an 
Englishman any other answer than that 
of his Native Language, it is the same 
as an Englishman writing a book and 
[*!*] mixing with it French, to shew his knowledge 
and to make a clap-trap for his reader 
by using a French [word] expression when 
he thinks it more expressive than an 
English one or rather to supply the deficiency

May I ask if you could, if desirous so to do, give Greek 
Hebrew or Spanish answers to may Seer who knows 
neither - or is it necessary that the Seer should know 
the language of the response.

1259 
6777  Spirits can show other language but 
they cannot give it as emanating from 
themselves.

I ment'd. that in many instances, as the German of 
Bertha Von Rosenburg "The White Lady" the Hebrew (in 
Vol. p) & other places - when the Translation appeared 
I presumed the Spirit of the Crystal gave it

1260
6778   It is so.
12

May I ask if Bertha Von Rosenberg still haunts 
the Castles of.

6779 1261 No she does not.

When the White Lady Appeared and stated it was the 
last time of her appearing on the Earth, it appeared 
Absurd and beyond belief that obscure individuals 
like ourselves should be the last to see her.

6780 1262 It was so, she had before that appeared 
for the last time in her old haunts in the 
visible form, and as she was becoming 
happier, she was induced by a person 
appearing in your crystal, to appear 
also.

May I ask who it could be that induced her to 
appear.

6781 1263 Hunder induced her to appear

About the same time Three Frenchmen were tried 
for killing another Frenchman in a duel, and the 
deceased Frenchman appeared, [was] to us, was that 
duel fought fairly

6782 It was

Was Anthony who is now in prison the man who 
shot Cornnel

6783 1264 Yes if you remember I told you at the 
time he did it

As one of the Men he murdered lived long enough 
to swear to him he will now be hung, & thus meet 
his Earthly punishment for so dreadful a Crime.

6784 1265 Murder of course is always as revolting
as it is sinful, but in this case the 
Circumstances under which he did it 
in part, extenuate his Crime.

May I ask you with deference how that can possibly be
13

6785 At least it would do so in the Eyes of 
his Heavenly Judge.

Abt. the same time there appeared in the Crystal a 
little girl, then some years deceased, who said she 
appeared in Consequence of Emma having that morning 
handled a dolly formerly belonging to her, & also some 
blue beads which she when a baby had worn, is it 
possible, so apparently trifling a subject should be 
sufficient to cause a Connection - & induce her to appear

6786 1266 It is so indeed.

Dead people so long as they are not in 
the Highest state of bliss, will some more 
than others cling to things, that they 
have left on earth, or rather I should say 
they have some of their spiritual 
influence with those things, which never 
can be destroyed.

I should advise every one to keep 
as little as possible about them, that 
belonged to a deceased friend.

They have more cause to do this 
when any near relationship or affection 
existed between them.

About the time when I made my black magic 
mirror we had a vision of Herman S [Kerbroff?] who 
stated he was murdered in Germany in 1843 - do 
you know any thing of that Herman S Kerbroff 
or the "Lord Pelham" he mistook me for

6787 1267 Had the vision really appeared to the 
person he named, he would have had 
cause to shudder.

About 2 or 3 years then dead in Paris a Mystic 
named Alphonse [Cabagant?], altho only a humble
Count [Cagliostro?]

See page 17. The Gentleman who then appeared 
proving to be Count Cagliostro - see also [?]
14

workman, he published several [?] works on 
Spiritualism & mesmeric exstacy may I call him 
some Evening with the Mirror, if it is agreeable to him to appear

1268 6788 I have no objection for the Crystal being 
used for that purpose.

I have not used my Japan Crystal for a long time 
may I ask who is now the Spirit of it.

6789 1269 LOW

If in Consequence of my letters appearing in Robert Owens 
memoirs, I am asked for instructions - on Crystal Working 
am I to give it

6790 1270 That greatly depends upon the 
circumstances under which they ask you.

I have in my old magical MSS. many formulas 
for raising Spirits by "Circle Work," to visible apparn. 
to those calling, but I presume it is only [good?] spirits 
who could thus render themselves apparent to the  
Corporal sight.

6791 1271 It is only those that could possible 
Appear.

Is there any harm in my Calling Count Cagliostro 
to appear in my ES. Crystal

6792 1272 There is not the least.

He died in the Castle of St Michael at Rome in 1793 
Now 61 years ago may I ask where he now dwells

6793 1273 He is now on the 3rd Sphere.

May I ask if we can have in this mirror some 
of those beautiful visions, Emma used to have in 
the Japan Crystal

6794 1274 You can ask for them, and if they can 
appear, I have no doubt they will

I do not like to ask you such Trifling questions
15

as I can ask of Atmospheric Spirits but I hope to 
resume my Spiritual Questions next Tuesday

1275 6795 I shall always be gratified to aid you 
in your researches.

I am aware that my answers this 
Evening have been very brief, and I feel they 
are unsatisfactory, but believe me it is from 
no cause of yours, or any one upon earth.

You can judge it may be but faintly 
my feelings this day, when I have received 
one thousand souls, that were slain 
together on the field of faith.

As they left that battle so they 
appeared to me in body and mind

Some of these men died prepared, but 
the state of mind which some died in, I 
cannot describe, but it is a blessing to 
know, that as the war is at the instigation 
of Almighty God, and carried on for his 
purpose, that he forgives all those who die 
for that Cause.

He gives them no time for repentance 
and therefore he requires none.

This war affects us as much as it 
affects those who are engaged and it is 
impossible for me to describe the sympathy 
we feel for those who have been cut off in 
the midst of life and health.

With us all men are on an Equality, 
and therefore [?] world, those who 
serve best have the best reward.

It is powerful to see that there are 
on the battle field many sent forward
16

at any hazard while their superiors are 
screened even at the loss of their honor.

Thank God it is not so here.

When I have lately read the Blasphemies which 
Nicholas the 1st is said to have addressed to his troops 
asserting in the Name of God & of Christ the most 
Atrocious falsehoods - when priests the ever willing 
abetters of despotism brandishing their [Crones?] asserted 
that [Jesus?] & tell his holy Angels would fight in front 
of the Russian troops whom they thus hounded 
on to Slaughter, I felt the truth of the French 
Revolutionary Cry, that there would be no peace on 
Earth for man until "the last King has been 
strangled with the entrails of the last priest"

6796 1276 Did you then think that the Almighty 
punished those men according to their 
sins, when he himself caused them to 
be slain for his own purpose.

May I [not] ask if war is not entirely opposed to the 
precepts of Jesus Christ, who even tells us when struck 
on one side, rather to turn the other to be struck also 
than to resent it.

6797 1277 Jesus Christmas himself was opposed to War 
but when he uses those words, he means 
one man at war with another.

No human reason can be given 
sufficient for setting Nations at War 
with each other.

During the happy Millenium or thousand years peace 
I presume there will be no Kings or priests required

6798 1278 There will not

I [set?] Thanks I asked if the CA had any furr. advice

6799 1279 I have not this Evening

6798 The ES Crystal (a)

Emma remarked the Crystal became Charged with a 
different Kind of Cloud or Mist than that which 
precedes Atmospheric Spirits - & that she could alwys 
tell by the mist whether an atmospheric or other Spirit 
was going to appear - presently she said it is a Man 
he's getting larger fast - It is now very large, hes 
a man with one Arm resting on a beautiful Caned 
mahogany sideboard, like one of those [Nineveh?] 
figures one Elbow leans on it, & one leg across the other 
I never saw him before, its a beautiful french 
polished [barred?] sideboard, and there's a lamp stand 
on the sideboard, and the light is thrown on his face 
a cut glass lamp which reflects, his hat is on he 
has black Trousers, a rough [pecuna?] great Coat, 
a very big Coat it makes him look so big round the 
shoulders, with great sleeves, unbuttoned, while 
[?] black studs, and very small pattern black 
and while cravat white tie, white Collar, black hat 
& black running band round it, black hair as 
straight as ever it can be, it comes down on his 
forehead below his hat, rather a full face no whiskers 
very pale, black eyes, very fair skin, but no beard 
nice shaped nose and mouth, wide across the eyes 
and very short, from the mouth to the chin, which 
gives a wide face, a black Kid glove on one hand 
he is looking into his hand that has no glove 
on - but whatever is in it - it must be very small 
he looks as Natural as tho' he was just going 
to speak.

May I ask your name

8. PM Smoked the CA.

The CA is here in white edged with narrow black - no purple 
stones or crown.

8.15. Is it agreeable for me to ask some further questions

6799 1290 It is

1*. The Roman Catholic Church asserts that Mary the mother 
of our Lord was before it & ever after the birth of our Lord 
a virgin, that is perpetually a virgin, as she is no where 
in the New Testament called "the Virgin Mary" may I 
ask your view of the Subject

6800 1291 I am perfectly certain that it was an 
immaculate Conception

Do you mean thereby that the Virgin Mary was an 
Immaculate Conception & that she was not born in 
Original Sin like other persons.

6801 1292 That Jesus Christ was not born in Sin 

I reasked question 1*

6802 1293 She was not.

Was the Virgin Mary born in Original Sin or not

6803 1294 She was not.

The Roman Catholic Church apply to the Mother of 
our Lord "The Title of Mother of God" this to a 
protestant appears blasphemy will you favor me 
with your view of such a title

6804 1295 Taken in the sense which they intend it, 
there is no harm.

But if they imply that she is the 
Mother of the Almighty then it is 
sinful.

No Notice is given in the books of the New Testament if 
as to the time or manner of her death, some 
authorities suppose she died in peace, others as
[Luecy?]

(a) See this word "Inspired" explained on the next page =

Woman who are you 
What have I to do 
with thee
[*19*]
as a Martyr may I ask if you can inform me 
when where and how she died.
1296 6805 She died at his Sepulcher and ascended 
into Heaven with him.
[As?] you mean that she died on the 3 May
6806 1297 I do
Can you inform me how it came to pass that so 
important an Event should have been omitted by 
all the Apostles.
6807 1298 Because none of them not Even her Son 
believed her to be Inspired.
[Rx.?]: 3d Are you &c
6808 1299 I am.
Reasked. the cause of so important an event being omitted 
by the Apostles.
6809 1300 Because none of them looked upon her 
as being any other than an ordinary 
Mortal or any more than those who 
surrounded her and fell on their faces
Jesus Christ himself did not believe 
that she was [?] inspired while upon earth.
I was musing upon this Answer when Emma said 
now there is some more reading Come. — and then 
read the following

6810 1301 Directly after the fall of Adam, it was 
determined by the Almighty, that the 
Human race should still be made happy 
the great scheme of redemption was 
then formed
It was determined for this purpose 
that part of the spirit of himself called
[*20*]
his Son should be born into the World
[*6810*] The Virgin Mary was selected by 
The Father as the instrument of his 
descending — but it was never permitted 
by him for his Son to know that she 
was any other than his mother in a 
worldly sense.
[*/a/*] By his making her the instrument 
of his Sons birth she was of course 
Inspired — in every other sense she was 
an ignorant Woman
Jesus Christ never felt for her the 
Same as he would have felt had she been 
the same as himself, he looked upon her 
as in Common with all others of the 
Human race, and when she had rebuked 
him, and tried to exert Authority over 
him, it was the reason of his saying 
"Woman what have I to do with thee" 
but it was not the divine purpose to 
leave her to suffer upon earth, when he 
raised her Son to perfect glory.
It was believed by those who 
Surrounded his tomb, that after watching 
and fasting for 3 days, the ground though 
awful & startling sight of the Ascension 
killed her, but it was not so —
By the Father's will her Spirit 
left the body, and ascended with the Son.
As the [h?] [is?] slender on [acc?] of Mary's husband 
"Joseph" it is unknown when he died, did he die 
before or after the Crucifixion
21

6821 1302 He died before the Crucifixion

The 8th. September is dedicated to the blessed Virgins 
Nativity the romish Church asserting "A concert of 
Angels having been heard in the air to solemnize 
that day as her birthday - what is your view

6812 1303 It is not true, but it originated with 
the priesthood.

In the Apocryphal Gospel of James C.9. it is stated 
when the priest was about to give Mary as a wife 
to Joseph the latter said "I have sons and am old 
while she is yet young; shall I not then become a 
mockery to the sons of Israel". was that so

6813 1304 That part is not correct, 
It was the intention of Joseph to have 
married Mary but he never actually did 
so.

There are a great many books extant belonging to the 
New Testament Called Apocryphal - which when the 
books of present [?] ones [secured? text were ballotted 
for - as orthodox or otherwise, were rejected some only being 
their orthdox place by a single vote. - If I obtain 
them will you point out to me which portions of 
them are truthful & to be [received?]

6814 1305 I will do so.

Is making the Sign of the Cross even with the right 
and in itself of any Efficacy as against Evil 
Spirits, other than as an outward symbol of 
trusting in the protection of Jesus Christ

6815 1306 It is useless in itself, but when used by 
a believer who has faith in him, it is 
then Good.

Is it needful, desirable or proper to turn to the East 
when we pray in preference to any other point of
22

point of the Compass. North, South or West.

6816 1304 It is the heart that prays to God 
and the Spirit that ascends in supplication

I think that no part of the Christian 
Church is more absurd than turning 
one part towards the East.

There is among Cabalists an [?] tradition that 
demons and evil spirits have a dread or fear of Iron 
for which reason they consecrated "Magic Sounds" 
having on them the unpronounceable name - has Iron 
an effect [from] upon them, by some imponderable 
force inherent in it.

6817 1308 Many Evil Spirits cannot go near it, 
but some that can.

There are evil spirits belonging to 
different things, that have the greatest 
possible aversion, and indeed could 
not if they wished it, [might?] wish or 
influence things different from that 
wish they always inhabit

The Priests of Braham in [?] possess a Spell 
or Charge for finding out a thief by means of a small 
[?] Vessel, which placed on the floor of a room 
round which are a number of persons upon using 
certain Incantations over the vessel - it of itself glides 
over the floor to the Thief - if he is in the room. 
May I ask you to give me that formula

6818 1309 I will.
23

Mr Owen G. Warren has published a work in America 
on Spirit Manifestations, called "Supernal Theology" 
it appears a candid & conscientiously written work
and in the 5th Chapter at page 32 is a statement
purporting to be "a communication from the deceased
Sister of the Mediums, (by the mouth of the medium
who was only nine years old.) of her entrance
into the Seventh Sphere,  Will you allow me
to read it for the purpose of asking your view of
some passages.

1310
6819  You may do so, but in the first place
I must tell you that no one in the
Seventh Sphere can communicate with
any one upon Earth

I read pages 32 ,3, 4, 5, & 6.  & solicited the C As
Views.

1311
6820  Were some parts omitted it would be a 
slight description of the lowest Sphere.
    The Seventh has nothing in it that
can be put in comparison with any thing 
earthly.
    Having all knowledge you require
no teaching - all faculties & senses
united you want no particular subject
adapted to each.
    Being spiritual you want no Confine
of Space, and aerial you want no resting
place.
    You recognize there no one in particular
for were you to recognize & know them
you must like some better than others
and have human passions.
of Comet Cagliostro at page 17
211

Every portion of the Human Task, of 
the Human Senses, of the Human Being, 
is gone.

It is almost needless for me to say 
that neither Birds nor any of the [?] 
Creation enter there.

Their Image exists in the atmosphere 
in Hades, and in the lowest sphere.

But in the Seventh Sphere all 
are equal and alike.

Were it possible for a man to be taken 
from the earth just as he is, with all his 
senses about him, and set down in the 
Spirit presence in the Seventh Sphere, he 
would see nothing, it would seem a total 
void. He would instantly wish himself 
again upon earth.

It is only the angels that inhabit 
it, that can perfectly enjoy it.

I thank you, this being one of the few works in which 
exorcism (see page 42) against Evil Spirits is stated 
to have been and, [I convinced] may I ask the nature 
of the Spirit who thus spoke by a [?] only 9 [yds?] [?]

6821 1312 It was an undevelopd spirit of the first 
sphere

(a) On Tuesday last we had the Vision of the Atmospheric 
Spirit of a Stranger Gentleman unfortunately upon 
my addressing him he left - Can we see him again

6822 1313 He will appear again & I have no doubt 
when his form is fully developd he 
will answer Your questions

Will it be advisable for us to call Mr Anderson this
Anderson wounded

ES. died. before the papers were printed Mr Owens's 
[of?] [?] dieing & from other Causes.
25

Evening

6823 1314 He is Severely Wounded 
I think it would be better that you 
should not do so on that account. 
He was wounded entirely thro' his own 
Carelessness, he was 20 paces in advance 
of his Company of men.

Is there any objection to my calling Count Cagliostro

6824 1315 No Answer. 
You will have some papers when they are 
Printed - I should like one to be sent 
to ES. and if you have any objection 
at doing so, tell him it was my wish.

Is there any one else you would wish one sent to

6825 1316 I cannot tell you at present.

Have you any further advice &c

6816 1317 I have not.

Christmas is now close at hand, unfortunately, the loss 
of so many of our brave country precludes any 
merriment -

Smoked the C.A.

[Mel Air?] is here in Morning as before. 

Mr Owen has written me with the enclosed address 
he begs to return you his sincere thanks for your 
kind wishes & requests your view of this address

6828 1319 I am aware of his address to the
26

meeting, It is a very good preparation 
and one that will sink deep into the hearts 
of those that hear it.

But Mr Owen must modify his 
exertions

May I ask how they should be modified

6829 1320 his age requires more rest, and I am afraid 
the recent excitement and exertion[s] he has 
undergone will prove injurious to his health.

May I ask if you know from his G. Spirit whether he 
is likely to address his hearers upon the spirit happens

6830 1321 he will allude to it.

6831 1322 The first rain was the one that fell at the 
beginning of the World, that rain caused 
Vegetation & the harvest.

The latter rain is the one before 
the Second Coming of Christ - and when the 
last rain is gone the entire earth will 
be consumed.

May I ask you your view of the Origin or Cause of so many 
persons who I must in Charity deem sincere being 
led away by the Unknown-tongue-Mama of Edward 
Irving & the dogmas of the present self styled "Apostolic 
Church"

6832 1323 In some things their doctrine is very right

His followers have established the heads of which call themselves

Apostles & they claim I believe some portion of 
Inspiration - I have never been there nor am I acquainted 
with their Doctrine, are you aware of their particular

May I ask you the main heads of their belief

6834 1325 No answer

do you wish me to ask another question

6825 1326 Yes

Owen G. Warner says, p [45?]. If in the Company of Spirits 
any one have a headache, or nervous feeling, or any ailment 
some Spirit will at once if requested & often of his own second 
attempt a line of magnetizing, & they always succeed in 
some [?] of not perfectly, is that so.

6836 1327 The Spirits can enter any person that is 
unguarded against them, & so [?] them 
but it cannot well be called mesmerism.

[?] p.65 They seem generally to know when we are ill - or 
fatigued - or unhappy, and they use their magnetic 
power to calm and soothe both our mental and bodily 
ailments

As yet we know but little of the powers exerted by spirits 
but every day unfolds some new phenomenon illustrative 
of their capabilities and their benevolence: for generally 
what they do for us is a labor of love, though it 
may be done in the fulfilment of their prescribed 
duties.

6807 1328

That Book (O'Swanen's) is written by a 
man, and altho he states what he believes 
to be right - he can only tell you his belief, 
he is entirely wrong.

When seeming benevolence is only 
Artful design, and those kind of spirits 
are not able to soothe the mind or body.

To produce any physical manifestations, spirits generally 
require that the room be dark, to our repeated questions 
why darkness is requisite, they tell us, that we cannot 
yet bear the sight of a spirit, and they would have 
to assume a form that would be visible to our bodily 
eyes in order to exert much power over material 
substances, hence when we have felt our heads 
touched it has generally been in the dark - alone 
in the room and locked in.

The writer of this. by request of the spirits. always 
leaves a widow of his bedroom a few inches open. to 
admit of the ingress and egress of a spirit to make 
the manifestation which had been requested. 
those spirits have according to promise. manifested 
their presence in various ways, once the spirit of 
a near relative showed her face - and then before 
the writer of this spoke of it. went and told others 
what she had done - thus proving it was no 
illusion. on another occasion a brother came 
and clasped the writer round the waist so strongly 
as to make the embrace painfully felt. on 
another occasion. a hand was laid on his head 
and face several times. and once the writers 
name was called loudly by some voice close to 
his head.

6838 1329 The first part is preposterous to think that 
[?] should be left open for a spirit 
to enter, and depart is out of reason. because 
whatever they may be, however high or 
however low and bad. they are still spiritual 
and can pass thro any substance.

It is neither allowing them to be 
Spiritual or [material] mortal [endowed?] with 
Super human power, and there is no 
medium, because [where] they mortal they 
could not pass thro' a few miles and were 
they spiritual they would [?] no 
space.

A spirit can make himself feel 
but in doing so his influence over a mortal 
is terrible, even afterwards that man's [hand] 
mind is guided and governed by the Spirit 
that presses him.

Is not the occult power by which Spirits thus, guide 
[?] mans will Similar, to what is amongst 
mortals [?]. Electro. Biology

6839 1330 It is

O.G Women p. 67. Many Spirits were asked this question 
- Suppose you were placed in a strong and massive 
iron box. and a perfectly fitting cover put in 
(as a follower) and thrust down upon you. how 
would you escape! at first they did not know how 
to answer the question. some said they would prevent 
the cover crushing them to the bottom - others said 
they would pray to God for help - but the majority 
explained. that they would resolve themselves into 
minute atoms. and escape through the pores of the 
metal. all agreed that they could not be injured.

6840 1331 The one that asserted that I should 
certainly believe to be Evil

Were it possible for a Spirit to be 
confined in a box, long before the lid could 
be closed down by the quickest mortal 
that Spirit would have evaporated into 
Air.

I have among my Magical Mss. the form of a [Prayer?] 
[?] into which Solomon is said to have enclosed 
a Legion of Evil Spirits, & the Seal used. - Is there any 
truth in that assertion

6841 1332 There is, but they were kept there by a 
Magical Charm not by a mere force 
there are powers by which men can limit 
Spirits to Space.

OG Wanen p. 64. They have the power of creating whatever 
the desire. whatever robes they desire to wear, they 
possess with the wish. they paint, sculpt. write or 
compose music - and their productions are as tangible 
to them. as ours are to us, the artist by means 
of his will - paints a picture. and shows it to his 
friends. as really as if on earth; and the poet 
writes, and finds admirers of his verses as he 
would here.

6842 1333 It is so in the first sphere

I have read several very beautiful Poems, stated to 
have been Communicated to Mediums by deceased 
Poets, as Edgar A Poe. [?] [?]. I wish you wd. 
allow a Spirit of the 1st. Sphere to write a poem 
to [?].

6843 1334 I have no doubt it can be done

I shall be much gratified, if you think it will

not have any evil influence on my Seer

6844 1335 There is no harm in it 
I will ask him.

OG Warner p. 49. There are special providences - but 
generally the will of man and the operation of 
natural causes govern the phenomena of the phisical 
and oral world, there is a natural limit 
to each life, accidents excepted. one could not 
live beyond a time. but might die sooner, the 
different ages of individuals are ordained and 
many are intended to leave the earth in infancy 
and have their new experience of life cheifly in 
the spiritual spheres. all spirits feel that they are 
children of God. and love him from their innate 
and natural affection.

May I ask if all mens times are preordained as to their 
duration as here stated.

6845 1336 It is known but not predestined

I cannot with my limited faculties conceive how [a] 
the length of a mans life may be foreknown and 
yet not predestined.

6846 1334 For instance we know that such a man 
will die on such a time unless he is saved 
by the Special interference of God, but at 
the same time we do not say that such 
a man must die at such a time, because 
where accidents prevented, the parties 
would live for several years afterwards 
but if their divine maker knows it is 
best for them to die now, than to live longer 
they they die

In arguing with Mr Gilkes on this subject yesterday Morning 
I argued that I could not believe that many by any
Copy 38
32

Act of his own could lengthen his life, Altho, [?] 
demonstrated that I was wrong, inasmuch as the 
Average duration of life in this Country is increasing 
[?] to improved sanitory & other measures.

6847 1338 A many by his own Efforts cannot lengthen 
his life. - but he may shorten it.

May I ask by what Law it is that out of a 1000 persons 
born now - a [?] number have a Chance of living 
to a greater age than 50. or 100 years ago.

848 1339 The difference is not great

The years of man are three score & ten.

And if he lives beyond that age it is for 
Gods purpose.

OG Warner p. 70. - It seems that there is no merit 
whatever in belief. all are in error. and it is one 
of the natural conditions of our life on earth. more 
over, the second and third spheres are also full of 
errors. and so through all the spheres. the spirits 
progress in love and wisdom. and by slow degrees 
unlearn what they have wrongly learned here. 
their errors are not imputed to them as sins - and 
it is of no importance whatever in the great concerns 
of eternity which of the many faiths a man believes 
so long as his heart is right. he may not be baptized 
- he may not join a church - he may not believe in the 
Trinity - he may not believe that every word of the 
old and new testaments was written by the finger 
of God - he may not believe that Christ was identical 
with God - he may have doubts even of a future 
existence, and never in his life have uttered a 
prayer. and yet if his heart is overflowing with 
love for his fellow beings. and if he does all he
33

can to meliorate there moral and phisical condition 
he has fulfilled the greatest and most important 
of the duties assingned - his errors of belief will be 
easily dissipated by the teaching of angels: and his 
chance for an early admission to the higher spheres 
will be far better than the chance of the cold 
and uncharitable bigot - however true may be 
the doctrine he believes. a correct belief is of no avail 
and no merit is attached. one cannot help believing or 
unbelieving. if Christ's sermon on the mount could 
be made the foundation of all religion - and if those 
who professed religion would manifest their 
faith to the world by their acts kindness and charity, 
there would be no more dissesion.

6849 1340 It is wrong

Any man to be saved must believe in the 
Trinity and in the death of Christ

It does not matter by what sect he 
belongs, or whether he be baptized

I look upon the earth & see every sort 
of religion, and I look upon them as 
- and amongst them all are 
equal number of believers

****

6850 1341 I mean every one who believes himself 
to be in the right way, who worships one 
God, let that be who it may.

The I presume the pious Moslem, Buddhist or 
[Aryan?], who sincerely act right according to their 
[?] belief - will [?] attain truth.

6857 1342 They will, they are admitted into the 
first sphere. on account of that belief - 
Copy 41
34

they have the means of believing and they 
do believe. and whatever they believe it is 
right to them.

Swedenberg asserts that there is no Salvation after 
death., that is that a man must merit Salvation while 
on this earth. - he must then be wrong in that assertn.

6852 1343 he was.

OG Warner. page 70. Of the change which death produces 
in the spirits of men, much has been told us. according 
to the information given us by many different 
spirits from all the spheres [?] that 
all are happy though in different degrees. very 
bad men on arriving in the second sphere of unrepentant 
and still disposed to be mischevous are 
disgraced. and they are shut out from the companionship 
of other spirits. until their feelings 
are changed. yet in every case the spirit is better 
than the man was on earth. he leaves behind him 
his vices and his crimes. he has no longer the will 
or the power to commit murder or robbery - nor can 
he be guilty of the thousand nameless vices and 
wrongs which made up his life on earth. he has 
therefore at death made a great advance towards goodness.

6853 1344 A man must enter the first sphere, [purely?] 
Spiritual and without it can 
then try to advance, but it must lead 
every bad quality in the Atmosphere

When we were practicing as Writing Mediums, one of the 
Spirits made by Emma a diagram of the Seven 
Spheres - will you kindly favor me with a diagram

Owen G Warren p 71 There are no bad spirits - that is no 
devils or demons. those spirits we have conversed with 
will not allow us to use the term. they say emphatically 
"there are no bad spirit" mischievous spirits 
there are. and those that are disgraced. but God 
made no bad ones. sins are looked upon with 
pity - not with anger - and all the sinning and 
erring are instructed and persuaded until 
they reform. It is not the cultivation of the intellect 
that qualifies a spirit to rise. the heart must be 
pure. one of our friends told us that she went directly 
to the Third Sphere "because" said she "they said I had 
a pure heart".

6856 1347 It is almost useless for me to do so

May I be allowed to ask some further questions this 
Evening -

6858 1349 Yes

I wish you to congratulate Mr Owen for 
me on his success last Monday week.

I will with pleasure., I regretted to find there were not 
more influential persons present, but I never heard 
so large an Audience, set so quietly & with such 
undivided attention. I hope the meeting in May 
next will produce Adequate results.

6847 1350 Doubtless it will

As to the War.

6860 1351 I believe it will terminate before the Spring 
I hope it will terminate (honorably?) 
and I trust that peace will not be obtd.
37

before the Allied Army have taken Sebastopol 
should the war terminate without that 
the blood of so many [Cross?] fellows will have 
been shed in vain.

My lack of "Scholarship" prevents my reading the old 
& New Testaments in Hebrew or Greek I can therefore only 
ground my belief upon the language as given in the 
received Translation of the protestant Church. Compared 
with the Roman Catholic & Unitarian Translations. and 
their respective Glosses. and altho you have informed 
me that Translation is sufficiently correct, I cannot 
shut my eyes to the fact. that where passages would 
admit a diverse rendering - A rendering has been given 
most in accordance with the belief of the Church 
Rampant at the time of the Translation - I mention 
this as a reason for y requesting you of your 
great favor towards me, to furnish me with a correct 
view of those passages, leaving it to you to give me as 
you deem fit, either the most correct rendering of the 
Original or the Ideas intended to be expressed -

ArcBishop [Whately?] in Note C to his "Revelation 
of a Future State says. - "As for the state of the Soul in 
the Interval between death & the general resurrection, the 
discussion is unnecessary, and perhaps, unprofitable; had 
knowledge on this point been expedient for us, it would doubtless 
have been clearly revealed; as it is we are lost in Conjecture

"If the Soul remains [?] and unconscious (as 
it does with respect to the sleeping faculty, for instance 
when the eyes are closed or blinded) till its reunion with 
matter, the moment of our Sinking into this State of 
unconsciousness will appear to [?] to be succeeded by that 
of our awaking from it, even though 20 centuries may
38

intervened, of which any one may convince himself by 
a few moments reflection."

May I solicit from you a dogmatic Answer to the 
following question - and your former responses on the 
same subject I can add in support

What is Man in Death?

6261 1353 Death itself is caused by the Soul leaving 
the Body -

The material and the Spiritual body 
then Separate

If he (O'Whately) believes that the Soul & the 
body rise together, he cannot allow that 
there is a Spiritual existence because 
it must then be a second earth.

May I for the same purpose ask you again. 
What is the human soul? is it capable of a Separate 
existence, and what is its Separate State after death 

6862 1354 The Soul is the after existence, or rather 
that which is given by God, unto man 
to exist when the body has perished

It is capable of a Spiritual existence 
apart from the body.

Attached to that it could not go 
into the presence off its maker and live 
in the Spiritual world.

After death it is the Spiritual 
body of him that died, and as such 
makes its progress, quite conscious of its 
own Existence through the Seven Spheres 
and when it has arrived at the Seventh
39

it stays there to meet its reward at the 
great Trial -

I was preparing to read Job 14. when Emma said, here is 
more reading Coming - & then said.

6863 1355 Should you ever publish to the world 
my answers to those, and the other works 
some time before, and if your opinion 
agrees with my knowledge on the subject. 
for to me it is beyond all doubt, I should 
wish you to give them as Emanating from 
yourself and should those to whom they 
are addressed refute the Doctrine, I am
ready with a second answer

Your wishes once expressed, I have an earnest desire 
to fulfill - but allow me to observe that I have an 
insurmountable objection to "Shine on borrowed plumes." 
or to appear as claiming a knowledge I do not possess

6864 1356 You are wrong there.

The answers which I have given you to 
night, show no deep learning, but they 
are the truth, and taking knowledge 
from your Guardian Spirit is very different 
from borrowing another mans opinions 
because you believe them to be true

But I di not ask you to give them 
as emanating from yourself unless you 
believe them. and unless they are the 
same in substance as you would have
Job. 14.10 But man dieth and wasteth away, yea man giveth up 
the Ghost and where is he.

11 As the waters fail from the Sea and the flood decayeth and 
drieth up

12 So man lieth down, and rises not till the heavens be no more, 
they shall not awake or be raised out of their sleep.

questions

Job 14.10
Job 14.11+12.
Am I to receive there assertions as revealed
dogma, or only as Jobs [?] of the subject according
to his limited knowledge + belief.
6866 1358 That is Job's own opinion as far as his
earthly knowledge goes. -
Bishop [Lowth?] says "That which struck their [?o?es]
they delineated in their descriptions; we there find no exact
account - no explicit mention of immortal spirits" + again
the condition, the form, the habitation of departed spirits
were therefore concealed from the Hebrews, equally with
the rest of mankind, nor did revelation afford them
the smallest assistance on this subject."
May I ask you to give me an explanation why
in the Old Testament, Revelation does not furnish any
information upon a subject apparently so important
to man.
1359 6867 The most important part of Scripture
the New Testament mentions, the death
and Resurrection + also the Second Coming
of Christ.
Before the Coming of Christ upon
Earth they had no knowledge upon the
subject.
The members of the Christian Church look upon the
Old Testament as a direct revelation from God
Copy 83
[*41*]
[*13608*] [*6868*] The New Testament may be considered so
but not the old. There are very many
contradictions in it.
May I ask of the Prophets Isaiah Jeremiah Ezekiel
Hosea Habbakuk + others divinely inspired by God to
give utterance to those beautiful [p?ms] prophecies
which go by their names
[*6869*] [*1361*] No answer. 
Asked again - [exd?]
[*6870*] [*1362*] I cannot answer that question now
May I be allowed to ask that question some other [way?]
[*6870*] [*1363*] You may.
May I ask of the state of the soul of those who died on
this earth before the death of Jesus Christ differed in
any way from the state of the souls of those who died
on this earth after his death.
[*6872*] [*1364*] None ascended with the Seventh sphere
until after his death.
Owen G Warren page 79 All mankind were created male
and female — in pairs — perfectly mated, the male generally
comes upon the earth first, and is older by a few
or many years (The difference being generally from
five to twenty years.) and they are generally located
near each other, so that if circumstances be favorable
they can meet and be united but the chances are
much against the union as it is only about once
in a hundred and fifty times that they meet in
marrage on earth.

Woman. because if so, it would also be 
ordained they should each meet.

Owen G Warren page 79  Spirits pretend that they can
ascertain who on earth are natural partners, and
will sometimes inform them.  sometimes however they
refuse alleging that the person asking would be made
unhappy by the knowledge.  they perceive sometimes
that one of the natural partners has become refined
and pure. while the other is degraded in vice -
and thus they think at best to conceal from us the 
fact.
   After death the departed spirit soon discovers his
natural partner. if he be on earth the other will
watch over him and at his death be present
to welcome him to the second sphere.

1366
6874  I must again repeat what I have said so
many times before -
    That when the Soul of Man is separated
from the Body, it loses all knowledge of 
what has taken place on earth.
    In the spiritual spheres all are to
them alike, they recognize none in
particular but they feel love for them all
    There are some men on earth who 
have a great many lives, were they to
recognize them all when they have left Earth

passions must exist.  and where they exist in

The smallest degree happiness is at [??h??]
[Dev?] [Granen?] page 20 The natural partners are not
always permanently united until they both arrive
at the Seventh sphere -  as one will sometimes rise faster
than the other, from greater purity of heart - and as
it often happens that one of them dies in childhood
and rises directly to the Seventh sphere, from the time
when both have arrived at that sphere, they are indissolubly
united, and when their term of probation
is ended, they rise together to Heaven.
Both natural partners take the same name, as in
earthly marriages, tho' in some instances the name
of the female is retained, and that of the male
given up, the woman who dies unmarried and meets
there her natural partner, knows herself at once
to be his wife and takes his name.
The affection of parents for their earthly offspring never
ceases, but it changes in its character - because in time
the children no longer need protection and being
of nearly the same age, the relation of parent and
child becomes less and less felt.
Spirits find their natural partners instinctively
but where they are in different spheres there is
a little uncertainty, where both are in the same
sphere there is an instinctive knowledge
of their congeniality.

May solicit your view of these assertions as a final answer
1367 6875 that it is altogether wrong. I am perfectly sure
when they leave Hades for the first Sphere

For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage

they are perfectly level, there are no children
there then because those who die very young
ascend directly - those who are there are
in spiritual appearance even the same as
each other -- you recognize none but you
feel great sympathy and love for them
even as you would for yourself and arise
into the next sphere  the same,  those that
were in it before leaving it for the next above
them when they enter.
[*/a/*]     And in no state after death shall
there be "Marriage or giving in Marriage."

May I with propriety ask if when men & women
die they retain the distinction of sex as when on
this earth.

6876  They do not.

I was meditating how I could frame a work as

    They are not to be received as

Your remark as to my doubting you - gives me pain
My reason is this, as I have not the happy gift of
[arraising?] spirits, personally. I can only rely on my
seer not being misled by any other spirit  assuming your
appearance & when I receive thru' her my dogma or
doctrine which appears in any way at variance

I immediately exorcise, not from doubting your word but 
to make sure of your presence - have I made myself

1372 6880 When you have any doubt it is much 
best to an exorcism, but at the same time 
I can tell you, it is impossible for any 
Spirit to take my appearance without

I should never give my Consent.

Seers account. - I find that he would be satisfied 
both the [?] appearance of some of his friends, & I much 
desire to convince him of the objectivity of these appns 
at least so far as Emma is Concerned.

1373 6881 I cannot but feel that Mr Gilkes has 
shown disrespect to me, and altho I cannot 
feel the slightest resentment. I dislike 
being pressed upon a point to which I 
firmly believe I have given a satisfactory 
explanation.

Therefore, I do not desire the attend'ce 
of Mr G- unless with different feelings

Sometime since you kindly offered, when Mr G. 
was present you would devote an Evening. to go thro' 
the whole of the Scriptures & Explain to us their Scope 
& meaning - If I make an appt. with Mr G. for Tuesday 
will you kindly favor us by fulfilling your promise

1374 6882 I would rather appoint next Tuesday 
Week.
47

I am as yet so far in arrear with my minutes for 1853 
that I am afraid when I ask by mistake a question a 
second time that you may suppose I don't form a [?] 
or doubting feeling

1375 6883 No I do not indeed - Your memory must be 
more than human if it could retain all I 
have told you

When may I have the Continuance of the Vision [IRC?]

6884 1376 I will tell you before I leave

When at Mr Leas - I called Count Cagliastro into the Crystal 
he appeared as usual with a book, & was exceeding angry that 
Mr Lea could not understand him. Can I call him 
this Eg. into this Mirror or the ES. Crystal.

1377 6885 Are you sure it was Joseph [Balsamo?] that 
appeared -

I think it would be much the best to 
use the Crystal in calling him.

The Japan or the ES Crystal

6886 1378 The E- S- Crystal

Can we see Mr Anderson this Evening

6887 1379 When he begins to make this statement 
it will last nearly the Whole Evening

do you mean Mr Anderson's statement

6888 1380 Yes some Friday evening will do for that 
if you do not wish it to interfere with any 
usual stay.

I will postpone it to next Friday Evening.

6889 1381 No you can call him this Evening, & I will 
enquire whether Mr Anderson will appear on 
Friday

I was much concerned on Friday at seeing a neighbour
48

Pass our house, so paralyzed & [destituted?] by Rheumatism 
that he could scarcely drag himself along. - Would it be 
advisable for me to Mesmerise him for it - I do not 
believe his Medical Men can do him any good.

6890 1382 I believe that Mesmerism is a very great 
benefit in such cases

The Mesmeric Infirmary is open to such 
Sufferers

But let me entreat you not to take 
a Case in hand which you do not thoroly 
understand

You might send a letter to him 
inducing him to try it - but while your 
name is on the Eve of being sent forth 
as the student of these mysterious sciences 
do not let it be [maimed?] by the unsuccessful 
Issue of an intentionally good Case.

My Young Seer Suffers so much from Cold, may 
I [?] this Mirror on to the Table so that she may 
Sit at the table near the fire to inspect

6891 1383 I do not like it being [?]

When I reflect upon the past events of my troubled 
life, I am at a loss to conceive why my then Guardian 
Spirit did not prevent my follies & their Consequent 
Sorrows. -

6892 1384 Man is born into Sin - had your 
Guardian Spirit prevented all those Evils 
what need would there have been of a 
Saviour 

You pass thro the ocean of Life, to 
reach the Shore of Eternity. - Although
49

the Guardian Angel may Save you 
from sinking - he cannot save you 
from being wrecked. he may guide 
you to the shore, but he Cannot remove 
the Stones (yorks?)

It could only be by a special providence 
that a man on entering the world shd. 
have a guardian Spirit Sufficiently strong 
to keep him through life from all 
temptations -

Were it wise for a man to pass through 
life without Trials the Almighty wd. 
surely have granted that poor man 
who so lately has been Convicted of the 
murder of two men, a Guardian Spirit 
sufficiently strong to prevent it

I know but little of the Circumstances of the Murders 
still less of the Cause of the first. - & altho apposed to 
hanging, as an insufficient punishment, & demoralizing 
I think he justly merited it, & I cannot conceive 
upon what grounds his Jury recommended him by 
mercy. Remembering also that his Antagonist in the 
Duel appeared to us & said he had met foul play.

1385 6895 In your eyes he appears an Atrocious 
Villain, and as such it is but reasonable 
to believe he would be denounced by all 
men who have a human feeling for 
those Murdered.

but I look upon him as almost 
innocent of the Charges laid to him, that 
is to say, so far as his Spirit & Soul are
50

1385 Concerned -

I never consider any time lost in 
vindicating the Character of a man to his 
fellow creatures, let me be his advocate 
and I think I could soften your feelings 
towards him

It is the opprest and the lost sheep 
that are received with the greatest joy into 
the bosom of the great Shepherd.

6894 I know that it is useless to try and 
prevent him from sharing the fate of 
those gone before him, but an ignominous 
death in this world does not prevent 
him - a glorious birth in the next.

His parents were of the lowest grade 
morally and Socially, he had no education 
bad habits, and bad feelings are soon 
learnt in low French life. and naturally 
strong minded, brave and passionate 
he soon set all restrictions at defiance -

How different would it have been had he 
been educated under the tutorship of Robert 
Owen. -

For 20 years he had no Guardian Spirit 
without this and without any religious 
spirit, it is almost unnecessary for me 
to say that Evil Spirits were soon attached 
to him -

In many private affairs he believed
51
1385
4894
himself to be very unjustly treated and before 
he came to England he had injured many
people but, he had never Committed murder
those he had fought with & injured were not
his greatest enemies, he did not do it with
the feeling of hatred, he did not do it in 
the Spirit of revenge, but he did it because
he could not help it. The influence which
possessed him caused him to do it, when
he at the same time knew he was doing
wrong. Yet he had not strength within
himself to conquer that influence or even
to subdue its power --
Driven from his country with no
friend amongst mankind - no hand held
out to save him, he came to London
sometime after he had been here that
unfortunate Circumstance took place at
Egham - in that duel another
Frenchman fell - altho he went to the
field with the sullen Resolve to kill that
man, if it was in his power, he himself
did not use unfair means, the two seconds 
who were also Frenchmen had as much
interest in the affair as Barthelemy himself
and it was chiefly at their instigation that 
he undertook the duel. It was their dispute 
as well as his, but he being less cowardly 
than the rest, gave the challenge, the seconds 
determined that Corneat should suffer used 
unfair means. Barthelemy suffered first
52

1385 6894 Several things have happened since the 
Duel and the Murder of Mr Moore which 
tended to make his Natural disposition 
loose. it is generally believed that he went 
to the house of Mr Moore with the intention 
of Murdering him but of this charge he 
must be entirely freed - from a [?] 
animosity which he always had to his 
fellowmen, and distrust towards them 
eh always went about armed,

As Mr Moore no longer lives I will 
not dwell upon the injury he had done 
Barthelemy - it is sufficient for me to say 
that he had caused Barthelemy to feel 
Jealousy the most terrible that man 
can feel.

The only object he had ever felt 
an affection for, he found to be unfaithful 
to him. - Mor Moore was the Cause, he 
want to his house warm, & determined to 
remonstrate with him, at least, when he 
got there passion ran high and the fatal 
Effects are known, when he left the 
house he was I may [?] say almost 
insane, and the murder of the other 
man was accidental, in fact, the man 
was the instrument of his own death. for 
he caught the arm of Barthelemy by which 
he held the pistol & so it exploded.

His Calmness at this Trial, indeed 
ever since he has been Convicted has
53

1385 
4894

arisen from repentance. and the Jury 
who were placed there upon oath to return 
a true Verdict, felt in their minds that 
he could not be guilty of a cool & deliberate 
murder when he stood so Calmly, yet 
so self assured before them. and I am 
very much gratified to know that he 
will not pass from life without the Effort 
of those men to save him.


Thro life he has ever had two 
good qualities - Generosity & Bravery 
and for the Sins Committed under the 
Influence of an Evil Spirit, the Soul of 
that man Cannot be held responsible 

And I am sure that at the last 
he will meet death with the belief in 
Everlasting life.

Men have justice, but they have no 
true Mercy.

Will you please to Cause Cagliostro to appear.

4895 1386 I will

Mr Anderson will appear on Friday Week

10 30 PM. ES. Crystal

Called Joseph Balsamo

The Crystal veiled directly & Emma said, there is the 
Gentleman who came in & went away without speaking 
It is time, and he has a Crystal on his hand, he is 
looking into it - he is short stout, no whiskers - no

Moustache and dressed in the present 
mode.
May I &c
[*6896*] I am the Spirit of Joseph Balsamo.
Are you the Same who appeared on the [*6798*] & went 
away without speaking
[*6897*] I am
I have called you many times when at my friend Leas 
did you appear last Friday night to his wife
[*6898*] No I did not
Can you tell me who it was, who did appear when you 
were Called
[*6899*] I will appear again
tonight or some other Evening
[*6900*] Some other night.
then gone having stayed only 5 minutes.
♂die 23rd. Jan. 1855. [?]
Smoked the CA
he is here in Morning
May I request to know if we can have the promised 
Explanation of the Scriptures next Tuesday
[*6901 1387*] I regret that it cannot be so
May I request you to name Another Evening
[*6902 1388*] I did intend to do it, on next Tuesday 
Evening, but there are many duties 
which spirits are not exempt from
I will only tell you a week before 
and then I shall be certain that I can 
do it.
55

Shall I then await the fulfillment of your [?] before 
asking ay further Scripture questions

6903 1389 Ask any questions

6904 1390 It would have been best had it never been put 
in unless in a very different way.

he seems to have mentioned it too casually 
with other spirits -

If he had said it was his belief that 
he had appeared or made it appear possible 
by the force of argument upon it, it would 
have been different. - but I am afraid it 
will give him offence were you to 
ask him to omit it.

In page 14 [8] of Mr Owens appendix A - paragraph 8 
Mr Owen asked. Will Jesus Christ permit me to ask if 
there is reason to esteem Him more especially than any 
other the Son of God.? And received for answer, by the 
[?] Spirits "He was when upon Earth the father 
of [?]. The Messiah has not yet Come - 
The Messiah is a different spirit from Jesus Christ 
May I ask your view of that answer.

6905 1391 I do not wish that to be altered now. 
Jesus Christ is the Messiah or rather will
56

be at the Second Coming

He is the regenerator of Man Kind because 
thro him all [life] have life everlasting

May I ask do you mean by saying "I do not wish 
that to be altered now" that the passage is to be altered 
or to remain as it is

6906 1392 I wish it had not been written, but as it is 
done, I do not wish it to be altered.

6907 1393 I have answered you that question before

6908 1394 His influence was there, his Knowledge & part 
of his Spirit was there, together they formed 
a spiritual body representing him 

If I write to Mr Owen to explain the manner in which 
it is to be understood that JC. was present will you 
kindly assist me.

6909 1395 Refer a moment to the answer which I 
gave you sometime back on the [convn.?] 
Mr Owen had with Jesus Christ, I will 
then answer you

I then read the whole questions & answer Nos. 
& suggested that I should write to Mr Owen. with 
the passages referring to him & which I had not done 
before as I was in hopes he would seen fit to omit 
the passage Entirely

6910 1396 You are right it will be best to do so 
You can select some parts from that
57
1396
6910
which you have just read, and in addition
you can state.
that all persons who believe in the
divinity of Christ believe that he is an all-
pervading influence and that his Spirit
enters into the heart of those who follow
his guidance and do what they believe their
duty
They all believe that he is there to do
good to enlighten them , to purify their
hearts sanctify their actions and lead
them to Salvation
Then if they believe this they
can scarcely doubt that that same difference
Can take any form to do the same work
for others which he is doing for them.
Why is it unreasonable to suppose
that he should take the only means which
A man will allow to be used in any way
to convince him.
Mr Owen was more readily open
to conviction this way than any other
and what the Argument of men could
not Effect , a spirit would be able to do
by aiming at the weakest part.
If Jesus Christ left the most perfect
bliss , came upon Earth full of Sorrow
lived here for more than 30 Years amongst
the hardships + privations of life + amongst
the poorest of mankind.
If he was persecuted as no man
Levit. 19. 18. Thou shalt love thy Neighbor as thyself.
58
1390
[b?]10
as ever been [?ie], and died an ignominious 
death when he could have prevented it
solely for the love of man, do you not
think he would use his influence, small
perhaps at first but great if necessary for
the enlightenment and fine teaching of
any of those mortals who were willing to
believe.
No Christian will deny that he
can do this, and if he will do this for
those who have denied him, done
wrong to their fellow men, and yet died
in his belief at last — why should he
not do it for a man who through his
long life has had no aim but the good
of mankind, who as a man has
followed the example that Jesus Christ
set "Love one another",
"Love they neighbors as thyself"
"Do unto one another even as you
would they should do unto you"

[b?]11
1397
I am not sure that communication was
received rightly
At page 10 under date 8th Oct. 1854 [?] states
the spirits announced as present here
Kent, Jefferson, Franklin, [?], [?elly],
59
Byron, Elias, and Daniel the prophets,
contentment, comfort and last Jesus Christ, may
I ask if the spirits thus announced were all present
at the same time.

1398
6912  It is perfectly impossible for them all to
be present at the same time
    No dependance can be placed on
the answers of those mortals lately dec'd
You have just [named] read.
    It is very likely# that the likeness of
J. C appeared without answering any
questions, and I must here state that Mr. Owen
put the question in a [way] wrong manner
to get a correct answer.
    If he appeared for the first time
as other spirits do merely as a Vision
intending to appear again & answer
questions it is possible for the spirit
calling himself the Duke of Kent to 
have immediately taken advantage of his
absence and given him the answer that
was published.

May I solicit you to give me your view of the form
he should put his question in — if it is again
announced that J. C is present.

1399
6913  He should first ask him
"Are you J. C."
and then while he is yet present put the
question — "are you the Son of God"
Then, Believing you are such from
your own assurance am I to receive as
60
Divine authority, the Doctrines you 
preached"

May I remark you have not enjoined Exorcism?

1400
6914  It is perfectly necessary to do so before 
you ask the questions I have told you.

I will ask write the letter to Mr Owen.

1401
6915  I will give it you, and I must here remark 
what an advantage all those would have 
who seek intercourse with spirits, were 
they to use something by which they might 
become visible, as one spirit cannot take 
the appearance of another.  without his 
leave - by their appearance you would 
have the greatest satisfaction

I have just perused an article in a cheap tho very 
excellent little work. - on spirit manifestations, in 
which very extraordinary phenomena are related as 
having occurred. - & I regret to observe that so far 
from using Exorcism to prevent Evil spirits attending 
they witnessed manifestations of spirits who aroused 
[?] to be Evil. -

[140]
6916  It is also there stated that a poem of great 
length & beauty. has been written by a "Medium" 
May I at some future time be favored with a Poem 
in our Mirror

1402
6917  I have no doubt the spirit of a deceased 
poet would do so.    
    It is very possible to think that 
at that one meeting that      Evil Spirits 
lead the minds of the persons present
61

1402
6917   to believe that they do all these wonderful 
things - To show what power they 
must have over them, they do not even 
leave when the spirits announce themselves 
as evil, calm and sacred Truths would 
never sink into their hearts. and have 
the weight with them that those horrid 
appearances do  
     There is more excuse for the man 
who murders another under the strong 
influence of Evil passions, than there is 
for the people who go there with the 
Knowledge that those spirits are Evil 
and so inconsistent is man with himself 
in judging of the two things, and so 
unmerciful is he to man who is next 
the Godhead, and yet so lenient to the 
Evil that is within himself -
    That Judging those who go to 
these meetings, knowing that Evil Spirits 
perform[s] these wonders - he says
    "Oh the Devil has got hold of them 
and they cannot help it" 
but judging a fellow man for the murder 
of another they assert "That he deserves 
Capital punishment in this world and 
everlasting damnation hereafter."    
    When the letter has gone to Mr Owen 
I think for the present you have done 
enough.
    You must see how this is rec'd.
62

1402
6917  and what comes of it, before you venture 
further. for in these matters it needs 
both calmness, discretion & patience
These qualities which I am afraid your 
friend Mr Henry Lea. will never possess 
altho I so strongly (urged?) him to try 
& have [?] them he seems further off 
than ever
[*on ?
to me*]

I ret'd  Thanks & begged that Lero would aid him in 
developing his wife's powers of seeing but only for 
good purposes.
May I see Mr Anderson on Friday Ev'g as promised

1403
6918  It will be better for you to ask him to 
appear this Evening, or if not inform 
you when he can appear.
    Mr Dresser very much wishes to appear 
this Evening.

Mr Dresser as you are [?] now Confined to the Evani
Glass which I carefully avoid using as much as I
respect him in person, I do not wish to be annoy'd 
by him spiritually - Can we see this Evening 
Joseph Balsamo in the ES.

May I ask my frie's questions this evening

1405
6920  Yes

Mr Owen

1406
6921  I know what it contains, and I believe it
to be another step towards the success of
his much desired plans.



1407
6922  I do.  and it is also much best that in
this peculiar system which he has founded
and which if carried out strictly would
"Sow the good Seed" in the hearts of man
and which is intended to be universal
education that no religion should be 
named.
   Were he to mention that he must
name one particular sect, and were
that one sect mentioned all others would
be excluded.
    Where it is founded to teach
purity and benevolence it is unnecessary
that any particular doctrine should be
argued upon.
    Children brought up under
his method or in a similar way, I

64
think I have before stated to you my
Views of Education, could not fail to have
religious feelings.
Mr. Owen

1408 
6923  Mans character is formed for him in the 
first place because had he no education
at all he would be little better than 
a Savage, but if that education is 
performed rightly, it develops his own
will and his own Character.

Mr Owens friend Dr Henry Frans has favored me at
my request with the first of a series of questions to
be proposed by him, and as I wish to place his
questions before you so far as possible extraneous
of my own as my Seers mind  I will not make
any remark thereon. - Dr Frans says in his letter
he will place them "as Curtly as possible so as
to avoid making them a leading question    have
I your permission to propose them.

6924   You may do so

Question by Dr Frans
What is the human Will.

1409 
6925  The mind concentrated on one object
 Thought, and the powers of the mind
directed to obtain it.  
    But I may here state to you that the
will of men can only exist in opposition
It is a dominant power of the mind
65
which rises under restraint - and that
which is deemed impossible to be gained
by any other Agency of the [mind] Soul
is obtained by the will.

Is this nightly [Milton?]

1410  it is

6926
I called for [Mr?] [Cagliosho?] & Mr. Anderson last Tuesday
but had no vision will you inform me when we
can see him

1411 I will ask him to appear when I leave

6927  
A Brother of Mr. Gilbert [Gilkes?] is a believer in Animal
Magnetism, and has been mesmerising his son and
also as is termed by mortals Biologized him, that
is subduing his childs mind by the superior will of
his own, compelling him for instance to think
Bread & butter is plum cake and to eat it under
that impression - As I have an earnest love for
Children I have very strongly expressed my opinion
upon the subject to Mr. [Gilkes?] may I now request
Yours.

1412
6928  It is abusing a power that was sent
for a different purpose, and it is doubly
wrong for a parent to exert that power
over a child who has not the Knowledge
or Strength to resist it, it is as it were
making him an idiot & not responsible
for his own actions in Afterlife
He might at the same time
without any additional wrong cause
the whole take the whole of the childs
senses from him & then believe that he
was doing an act of Charity.
66

1412
6929  No the will of man was not given him to keep
the will of others in subjection
    The will more than any power which
man possesses leads him to distinction
for by that he rises above the difficulties which
would otherwise crush him.

I perceive by the papers that Barthelemy maintained his
Materialist views unto the last. & I am informed his
Father is a rich man in France. - have you any further
remarks to offer relative to him  since he has left this
World.

1413 
6030  You have stated right except his parentage
in his youth they were low ignorant and 
infamous people
    His Father may be and I trust is
[altered now?], but it is too late, to do him good
who so lately left the world
    I am perfectly aware that the greatest
mercy man will show him is to let his
memory sink into oblivion
    I gave you my opinion of him before
they are still unchanged,  and the water of 
regeneration shall wash out the blood of 
the Flesh.

Your view of the Mercy & goodness of God is indeed large
but it is so opposed to the dogmas of those priests who
arrogate to themselves the authority of being the sole
interpreters of Gods Views, that I do not know what the public
would think were your responses by any possibility
to be placed before them as Coming from a Spiritual[ist]
point of view -- Altho the doctrine appears most
Natural to him whose attribute is All Merciful as
well as All powerfull.
67

I was last evening engaged recopying my notes of the 
6931 1414 and read with great pleasure your 
merciful views of the Christian Doctrine of "Eternal and 
Everlasting Punishment" compared with those of 
[Drexelens?] & the Revd Tobias Swinden.

6932 1415 I have no doubt that he thought his 
justness if not his mercy would entitle 
him to a seat in Heaven.

Notwithstanding your kind endeavors to enlighten 
e upon the Occult Laws. of Spiritual Apparitions I am 
much astonished at your responses, being not only 
given in such fine English, but punctuated as used 
by mortals.

6933 1416. One Language to me is the same as 
Another - You ask me questions you show 
me printing, and letters which you wish 
answered, and my only aim is to 
answer them so that you may understand.

I only wish to be plain and at the same 
time - your wisdom & sense & 
your enlightened friends.

May I solicit you to inform me on what evening it will 
be [correct] convenient for Mohamed Ali to appear 
to answer some questions relative to the mineral 
Inscriptions

6934 1417 I must enquire of him first.

When can we have the continuation of the Vision 
of the Man in White

6935 1418 No answer

Shall I call Mr Anderson in this or the Crystal

6936 1419 In his Mirror

he will appear directly I leave

[?] thanks when Emma [?] here is [?] [leading?]
See 1244 and 1429.
68

1419
6437  Do you recollect when I appeared in
the mirror belonging to Mr Henry Lea
you asked the question
    If there existed a knowledge of the 
Events of a persons life at the time of
their death. or rather whether thoughts
were embodied and could be recalled
    I told you that at another time
I would give you more particulars on
that subject.

I shall indeed be pleased to receive your responses
when a subject so interesting to me, when will it be
convent. for me to receive them

1420  
6938  I  wish you to collect any questions
You may like for next Tuesday Evening.
I will then answer them 

The C A left  20' to 10 PM
Called Mr. Anderson
1/4 to 10. PM.
Mr. A. is here with the great rough [pecuna?]  [hat?]  the same he
had on a long while ago.  dear me how altered he is to be
sure.
Good Ev'g.  Mr  A.  We are indeed gratified by having you again
with us - You have had our earnest wishes for you lately

6939  Thanks for your kind wishes but health
cannot exist here

Where Mr A are you now

6940  At Balaclava about to start for home

No h's leaving - I requested him to remain &

6941  Can I do so 

When you were last with us you promised me
69
Your name, but if it is not yet agreeable to give it me
be assured, I do not wish it

6942  I will tell you when I leave this place 
I have been severely wounded since 
I saw you.

The C A informed us of that & we were indeed sorry to hear 
it. - The good Aberdeen. & ministry have been beat by 
a majority of 157.  so I hope they will resign

6943 Very nearly time I think

To die on the Field may almost be deemed a Soldiers 
fate, but for our brave fellows to perish with cold & 
hunger. thru mismanagement is unendurable.

6944  No imagination can fancy the state 
we are in.

To whose Incompetence do you military men 
attribute it to,

6945  The English Government in not 
supplying the Necessities
Lord Raglan in overlooking them.

It appears to me monstrous. to place an old man 
of 70. at the head of an army - Napoleon was only 
      when he had won. 
& Wellington      at Waterloo.

6946  It is perfectly impossible that he could 
do it, and I believe also that he is 
neglectful of his men.
    He ought to report their wants more 
urgently than he does. he has a very 
comfortable place himself, he takes 
care not to leave it in the cold

That is the fruits of our absurd "Seniority" legislation 
of the army - & officery from the aristocracy by purchase
thus effectually preventing any but the highest
70
and the lowest ranks of Englishmen from entering 
& strutting out what in every other vocation

6947  There is justice in your remark but there 
are many of the British Aristocracy more 
competent than Lord Raglan and there 
are many officers out here almost in the 
same condition as the men & they do not 
desire better

All honor where honor is due, But the officers 
Bravery is rewarded. by Name, Fame. Glory, & preferment 
Individually.   The common soldiers Equal bravery 
by Chelsea Hospital or a pension per limb lost. & 
returns a burden to himself & others - If Courage & Skill 
could raise a man from the ranks, there would be no 
need of recruiting Sergeants

6948  Being one of the Cloth you cannot 
expect me to run with the hare and cry
with the hounds - I did not mean that 
the officers had displayed Skill as general 
Commanders - of the Army. for no [more] 
battles were fought with more Stupidity 
and less purpose than those of the 
Alma and the Inkerman.
    Their individual Courage in the thickest 
of the fight, I can myself bear witness 
to   although there are many exceptions

It is now the 30th. Jan'y. with me   can you tell me 
any Event, death or wound of any officer within 
the last 10 days

6949 It is the 27th. Jan. with me
Nothing of importance has happened
71
Knowledge, I have been here ready to start
for 3 days.  I came there from the Hospital

May I ask where you were wounded.

6950 A [?] rifle ball in the right side

Have you obtained promotion since you have been out

6951  No but I was given to understand that I 
might expect it in a short time

Our friend Selina here has not seen, to it.  left

6952. Oh. he's a volunteer isnt he

Can you do any thing with the Crystal now.

6953 I have not lately.

We are going out next Saturday week to the Lyceum, I am
sorry we shall not have the pleasure of seeing you there

6954   I am afraid not altho before that I hope 
I shall have returned.  to the arms of my 
Queen,   I beg pardon my Country.

May I ask what ship you intend to come home in

6955  Hymilion      (very indistinct)

Is that an English or French Vessel

6956  English

I do not think there is a vessel of that name in our Service

6957  Perhaps you will enquire then

Do you know the Captains name.

6958   I cannot tell you, he came out with 
pensions & stores.  & will return with the 
Sick & wounded, the Captain who brought 
her out is ill.

Will you allow me to ask you a question solely for the 
purpose of enabling me to arrive at something like an accurate
conception of the - state of being & knowledge of those 
apparitions we term Atmospheric Spirits
     Are you present in this Room & cognizant of what is 
therein - Is your knowledge - the same as your other
72

self. in the corporeal body.

6959 I am aware that I am here as an Atmosphc 
Spirit and the personification of my body

I know not whether the knowledge 
is the same; but I believe, here my self, 
that I am telling you the truth.

I am aware that there is no law other 
than you mention by which you can 
discover its accuracy. but I feel the same 
here as I should in the body, and I 
assure you on the honor of a Soldier hat 
the Ship I have mentioned is an English 
one, and now lying in Balakelava 
bay. and that if life remains in me 
until that time I shall sail in it to 
Malta - from thence to [Marritus?] 
then to Madrid - the Court, and from 
thence to London. and I think then if you 
cannot feel but doubt of my being what 
I am, the best way of satisfying yourself 
is to ask your Guardian Spirit

I am aware you place great 
dependance in him and I am sure 
he will do me the Justice I so much wish

I explained my motives I hoped he did not feel offended

6960 I do not.

Will you name a day agreeable to you to be called

6961 I shall perhaps be in Spain in less 
than a fortnight, you can call me then 
as often as you please.

Do you [?] [G.?] F. [Barton?]

6962 he is not in the Army is he
73

he was in the H [S?] [I?] Service I do not know whether he 
is now in the Crimea

6963 I believe not

Can you in that state tell me whether I can see Count 
Cagliostro in my ES. or not

6964 I cannot.

As he was leaving I begged him to accept our best wishes

6965 I thank you - Good Evening

he's gone 25' to 11 PM

[?] 6th Feb. 1855. The CA Mirror

Smoked the CA

May I ask my further questions

6966 1421 do so

M Robert Owen. has sent me this letter with the MS. 
of part 6 of the New Existence. he begs you will accept 
his thanks for the kind wishes you have expressed 
towards him & solicits your view of this MS. shall 
I read it

6967 1422 Will you put them against the Seal

I place the whole 9 sheets agt the Seal

6968 1423 Thank you

IT is very well, but you know my 
opinions on the Spirit Manifestations

Shall I now take them away

6969 1424 thank you Yes. You can tell him 
that as his opinions remain unchanged 
on the Spiritual Manifestations, he is 
right to express them but at the same 
time I can assure him they are 
undoubtedly wrong.
74

Dr. [Frani?] has not yet sent me his second question, but 
I think I have not got Mr Gilkes in a cleft stick as he 
has agreed to write his answer to the Doctors questions 
& we are there to compare notes.

6970 1425 I am sorry he should doubt these 
things, for he is the only loser by it.

M Gilkes has promised me he will write to his brother 
as to Biologying his son

6971 1426 It seems practised a great deal now amongst 
Men.

It is became many who were once the most sceptical 
directly they come convinced like most converts or 
[?] rush headlong into the opposite extreme

6972 1427 I would that it could be swept away 
from the earth without injuring the 
better and higher effects of mesmerism 
for they may be classed together.

At a former sitting I asked some questions as to the 
human thoughts may I now with your permission 
ask. them again this Evening

6973 1428 Yes.

The more benificial the more it (mesmerism) 
can be abused. It is like the Indian 
Poison that produces the sweetest slumber 
on the very verge of death.

I believe Mesmerism to be semi-divine 
because in the first place it is a natural 
power, and being so it must be a direct 
gift of healing - and emanating from 
man and only taking effect upon 
living nature it must be a special gift.
75
See Nos. 1244 and 1419.

"The Author of "Mammon" has observed 
"The most casual remark lives for ever in its Effects; every word has 
a moral history; and hence it is that every idle word that men shall 
speak assumes a character so important as to become the Subject of 
Inquest at the day of Judgment".
76

In pursuance of your kind permission given in No 1244 & 1419 
may I now ask your promised explanation of the Law by 
which Thoughts once firmed I apparently lost & become 
perfectly oblivious - Can be again recalled. - are they as 
it were embodied, do thoughts once formed exist as entities

6974 1429 They do, the Bible itself leads men to 
believe that at the Judgment day, every 
action of their lives, also every word will be 
recalled and indeed were it no so in a 
Spiritual state how could man be judged 
for the Human.

The mind of man extensive as it is 
is not capable of holding and retaining 
the whole Ideas of a lifetime - and therefore 
it is absolutely necessary, that something 
else should exist that could contain them 
and that that something should be in such 
close relation to man that he at any time 
may touch a link that connects the 
whole chain - touch a chord as it were 
that vibrates and resounds with the whole 
volume of his ind.

Mans thought the most spiritual 
quality which he possesses is always in 
unison with the Spiritual body in which 
his discarded thoughts are held.

The slightest incidents which occur 
to mans mind, strengthens this unity 
& that brings forth every Association 
connected with the [?] subject 
called up, and this simple thing is 
truly a divine blessing, in giving only 
the train of things that associate with
77

1429  
6974   with that                        by the mind [which]   
that [gave] called them forth, for were it
[otherwise] allowed that the whole of what
the spirit possesses - that every thing
relating to mans passions & knowledge
should return to his mind at once it would
perfectly crush him
        The mind would not be capable
of bearing the different thoughts opinions
controversies, actions recalled and incidents
that have happened all at one time, and
thus altho the distinction is so slight
nothing more                shows the wisdom &
benevolence of The maker   than in thus dividing
the thoughts of man.
    Now when Man has lived his life
and draws near to Spirituality it is no
longer necessary that this knowledge of
hisself should be so guided & governed
that it should [?] his mind, and therefore
it rushes upon him simultaneously and
besides this there are two other reasons
why it should do so.
     It shows man even in the very
best life he could lead there is room for
repentance.
    And where it not for the Divine
Intercession of the mediator & Advocate
 Jesus Christ - he must of necessity  be
crushed under his own sins -- .
    The other reason is that [it shows]
before death or rather & should say at
 the moment of death. the bodily feelings
78

1429
6974  feelings are blunted and the spiritual 
feelings are more vivid and more susceptible 
than during life, thus it is drawn closer 
to the spiritual body. and they are in 
knowledge one.

May I ask if thoughts thus exist as it were on a Spiritual 
Form. - & to be joined hereafter to "mans spiritual body" as man 
[?] I mean punishable for his thoughts in the 
Corporal Body -- presuming as I do that mans thoughts arise 
from. his organic configuration - shown  phrenologically by 
his brain & also by what we term Temperaments, -- 
Involuntarily as it were leading them to scenes of 
War. or avarice or Sensualism

1430
6975  You misunderstood my meaning when 
I said that their thoughts were recalled 
to show that there was room for 
repentance, unless it were for the mediation 
of the Son  those innumerable  sins must 
be punished -   I meant that, that 
very thing gives them time for repentance 
and distinguishing from the bad from the good 
it gives them a longing after happiness   
    I will grant that a man is not 
answerable for his thoughts, neither did 
I say that he was so.

May I ask - if a mans thoughts at any certain 
time, can be shown on leading on a minor to a 
Seer.  in the same manner as we now read your 
kind response.

1431
6976  It is possible

In     a work was pub'd. entitled Revelations of 
Nature by Andrew Jackson Davis.  purporting 
and I believe truly so, to have been delivered by
79
then unlearned and almost an ignorant man, while 
in the mesmeric sleep. - the work contains a mass of 
     pages, upon the most recondite subjects - 
Astronomy   Geology. - The formations of the planetary 
bodies, their inhabitants etc  the whole clothed in 
excellent language & even technicalities of the different 
sciences -

1431
6977  It could not be more wonderful for him to 
to do that, than it is for a clairvoyant 
to follow a person into their house and 
give an exact description of what is in there 
It is the same power and it is the same 
power of a disengaged spirit
    When once you allow this, there 
is scarcely a limit to the power you 
possess.
    The Soul dormant and the Spirit 
absent it is perfectly easy for another 
Spirit to take possession and give you 
the knowledge you desire
    Have you ever noticed when 
speaking in the Mesmeric Sleep, the 
voice of the party is different from that 
in the normal one.

In an article upon Spiritualism in the [?], I ment'd. 
my belief that in the Clairvoyant State, they became 
Conscious of the Ideas of other persons living on the Earth 
however remote from them. & that A J Davis was enab'd. 
in his sleep to broach the Theory of Dis-magnetic 
principle - of Faraday - the Central Sun of [Maralev?] 
& the Existence of Neptune - before information of those 
discoveries had reached America - but that his 
knowledge appeared limited to known knowledge.
80

1432
6977  Your Idea is correct, but it does not 
lessen the Marvel and I think that it 
shows still more plainly that the spirit 
who took possession of the body must 
be a wandering spirit and one who does 
not leave the earth.

Is the spiritual form which you thus state to contain 
the embodiment of our ideas the spirit which we term 
the Atmospheric Spirit

1433
6978   It is

Then the wandering spirit speaking by A J Davis 
might have become acquainted with the atmospheric 
spirit of - Faraday or Maedler or.

1434
6979  No I have just said that spirit did 
not leave the earth., it was from the people 
themselves that he got the idea conveyed 
to the Medium

Do you mean the people in the room where he deliv'd. 
his Clairvoyant Orations

1435
6980   I mean the people all over the World 
in this Way.
     Suppose you were to leave any book 
open upon your table, it is in the 
power of one of these wandering spirits 
to read that portion of the book exposed 
to view, or a letter the same., but so 
nice is the distinction that he is not 
able to read or to see any thing that 
is closed to the human Eye, and thus 
wandering about catching men at every 
opportunity unawares he can gather as 
much information as he likes, upon 
every subject he can retain it, & express
81
it if he will, through different Mediums

I explained my old views as to the "Spiral" train of 
mens thoughts - & added I suppose, those wandering 
spirits can change the language of those thoughts 
to suit the views or ends they wish to gain

1436
6981  Yes it is only the ideas they borrow.

May I at some future period solicity you so far 
to favor me, as to request some deceased poet to 
repeat a poem in the Mirror that my Seer might 
transcribe

1437
6982  I do not like to do it  for you to gratify 
those people who will not believe any 
thing unless it is astonishing
     The fact of poetry being given 
should not have any weight with 
             to either believe or disbelieve in these 
subjects,  I do not wish them to believe 
and I a sure those who do believe 
do not need to strengthen it.
     I do not mind asking a poet to 
appear to gratify you or to express 
any thing more beautifully than it 
could be done in prose, but he shall 
not appear for the gratification of 
those who will not listen to true and 
reasonable doctrines because there is 
nothing in it that would make their 
senses feel that it is supernatural

I explained at length my reasons I requested to know 
if I had made myself understood

1438
6983   You have, and it shall be done 
You must feel my motives in not 
wishing to gratify those by these
82
means who will not listen to the other 
If through this they would believe the 
other, then I would not hesitate a 
moment. but it is not so with many 
of your acquaintances

As my young Seer suffers so much from the cold 
sitting here may I ask if we can see Count Cagliastro 
in the Crystal

1439
6984  You may

You can ask him to appear which I 
doubt not he will and whatever he states 
however singular it may appear, is 
nevertheless true

Shall I call him in the ES. or the Mirror

1450
6985  The Crystal.
I must leave it to your Judgment to 
receive any statement he may make

I ret Thanks.

1451
6986  Have you any particular reason for 
wishing me to appear next Tuesday 
Evening

I explained &c

1452
6987  I wish you to call me next Tuesday Ev'g. 
I have nothing this Evening
When next I appear I hope another 
of Dr Travis's questions will be proposed

The CA's gone 10' past 10' PM.

ES. Crystal
Called Joseph Balsamo -
He is here the same as before.
May I ask if you are now dwelling on this Earth

6988  I am.
83

May I ask by what name you are now known

6989 No answer,

Did you not as Count Cagliostro die in the Castle of 
St Michael at Rome.

6990 I did

Do you remember the MS you had called the Tables 
of [Rotato?]. which Mss. Miss [Bry?] & Scott. obtained 
surreptitiously from you & transcribed

6991 How you name it I do indistinctly 
as in a dream

I have that MS. - Can you explain to me the method 
by which you calculated the number for the Lottery 
at Rome.

6992 I do not know.

I related Prince Tallerands singular anecdote of the 
Water he obtd. from Cagliostro to [?] 
& asked how he caused such an Effect

6993 I impregnated the water with my 
Influence

Now he's going 10h. 25 PM.

[?] 13 Feb. 1855. CA Mirror

7.30 PM. Smoked the CA.

The CA appd. in morning as before

May I ask &c

6994 1453 I will answer them.

As I do not wish to have so many Crystals & 
Mirrors about me dedicated to different spirits 
may I beg to state that I would much prefer your 
taking charge of all of them.

6995 1454 Have these opinions & feeling arisen 
from your Interview with Joseph
84

Balsamo last Evening

I explained my wish was to increase my Knowledge 
upon Spiritual Matters. as much as possible, but 
only under the CA's guidance & protection.

6996 1455 I understand you

Although I look upon this Mirror 
as especially belonging to myself, I keep 
watch over the others, and I think 
it advisable for you to use them all 
at times as you may deem best and 
most fitting, keeping this exclusively 
for those spirits you believe to be good.

I am glad that you have mentd. 
this now. for it opens me a way to say 
something that I had intended this 
Evening

I wish you to inspect that Crystal 
again this evening and call Joseph 
Balsamo. - he will appear and 
perhaps your belief in me will be 
more tested, than it has during the 
whole of our Communion with each 
other. - 

I will not say do not listen to 
him, but if after what he has said 
you feel the same Conviction of these 
truths which it has ever been my 
greatest pleasure to lay before you & 
which have been solely for your benefit 
& the rest of mankind, I shall 
indeed humbly and thankfully rejoice 
If otherwise, I must pray to Almighty
85

God to do what I am unable to -

I explained at length my Interest in Cagliostro 
commencing in 1824. that I had in my possession 
the Transcript of his [?] - Cabalistic MS. on Numbers 
& had at different times collected materials. for his 
life = &c.

6997 1456 He will appear at 9 oClock.

Can I call. in the ES. without using any Spirits Name

6998 1457 It has no spirit attached to it at 
present

I had asked to go to Mr P. on Friday next 
& take one of my mirrors or Crystals with me can 
we then see the M Spirits of [?] she may wish to 
be called

6999 1458 I would rather that she [?] should 
come here

I explained

7000 1459 There might be others there besides those 
you mention, who would not be so [?] 
to believe it

It has made an interruption before 
I think it would be best at present 
that you should not do so I should 
be gratified at seeing Mrs. Parris 
herself alone here.

Shall I ask her to come next Tuesday

7001 1460 I should prefer Friday Evening any 
Friday evening that would be most 
convenient to yourself.

Can you tell me if [?] B[?] has succeeded 
on [?] Mims in the little Crystal or the Mirror

7002 1461 I cannot tell at present.

May I ask you next Tuesday

7003 1462 Yes
86

May I ask, again, by what Means Mrs. [?] saw in 
my Crystal such [Fifty?] subjects as she mentioned, but 
which from their Singular Accuracy & fulfillment 
are to most persons so cunning =.

7004 1463 Did you Invoke for her

I explained -

7005 1464 After what I have told you, you can 
scarcely wonder how it was done

No Invocation used, no Exorcism 
the woman too ignorant to read. 
The Vision could only be shown, what 
way more suitable to an Evil Spirit 
taking possession of a Crystal. and 
thus winding round until it got 
possession over you.

I explained that these circumstances so simple 
in themselves being foretold & then fulfilled, & where 
most convincing to a sceptic - & that altho, Ind. 
not for a moment, Call any objectionable Spirit 
into my Crystals. I regretted I could not 
as Easily Convince my Sceptical friends

7006 1465 I do not wish those things to 
take place with your Crystals or 
Mirrors.

When once you have to do with 
them by these means it is perfectly 
impossible for you to control them

The ways by which they can 
raise your Interest - the many subterfuges 
there are for them and their 
& artful designs make these 
means the most accessible to them 
if you wish these thing such as that
87

woman told you to be known before 
they happen there is another way 
by which you can do so 
to yourself

By what means can I do so

7007 146 My cards any of the things you 
have mentioned can be told by them 
& here there's no access to Evil Spirits

I have some time since promised to teach my Seer 
the Art of Card divining - If I aquire any information 
upon any doubtful part may I apply to you

7008 1467 Yes It is rather a different plan of telling 
them than is generally used that I 
should avise.

I will look among my papers for my system, & will 
if necessary request you to assist me, [?] the Cards the [Same?]

7009 1458 I will do so - the only difference is that 
they must have plain white backs, I 
will give you the first Instructions Now 
but I hope at present you will not 
mention it to Mr Henry Dawson Lea.

I explained

7010 1469 You first procure &c. &c.

7011 1470 You have the Signification of the Cards 
have I made myself understood

I will obtain the Cards and see if I understand 
your instructions,

7012 1471 Do so and then I will give you further 
Instructions.

May I be allowed to [?], that I have among 
my papers, a MS. upon Fortunetelling by Cards 
which I composed for my friend John [Dunley?]
88

the Bookseller's daughter in 1837 - & when giving her 
the necessary instructions & also when using it for the 
Amusement of my Friends I used to foretel Circumstances 
extremely frivolous in themselves yet which were so 
precisely fulfilled that I began to think the feeling 
of presentiment [raised?] by those means might be a Spiritual 
Prompting - & I have since found that [Cahagnet?] was 
of that opinion - is that so

7013 1472 There is nothing Spiritual about it 
either bad or good

Then I shall use it with great pleasure, I presume in 
your [?] like other Divinations, it is requisite 
that the [?] have an [earnest?] [deuce?]

7014 1473 Certainly it is of no use without that 
a regular system once formed you 
must not alter it.

I returned thanks

3 1/[?] 9. PM to the C.A left.

ES. Crystal

9 PM Called Jos Balsamo Commonly Called 
Count Cagliostro

Immediately he appeared as before

May I ask.

7015 Joseph Balsamo

Were you born at Palermo in Italy

7016 I have lived more than once

Your assertion appears to us mortals of limited 
knowledge Impossible may I ask your name & 
Nation at your first birth

7017 I know not, 
I know that I have lived, that
89

7018 [1474] I have died, I have attained 
Spiritual Knowledge. more than any 
other man upon earth. but I have 
come to one Conclusion

May I ask that Conclusion which I have so long 
and so earnestly sought.

7019 [1475] That all Religions are of no avail to 
procure a man happiness hereafter 
and also that the greatest truths 
believed in by man have no foundation

In making that assertion, am I to assume that 
you are an indweller of the Spirit World. or are 
you now again living on this Earth.

7020 [1476] I am living upon this Earth. and 
I only wish to secure others from the 
horrible conflict which has taken place 
between myself and Spirits

Your remarks are startling in what way do you 
mean to advise others to escape that dilemma 
is it by advising them not to use Crystals or Mirrors

7024 [1477] It is not altogether in this. they might 
use them as much as they like, but 
they should not be blindly led by 
any spirit to believe that which a [moments?] 
[?] reasoning would as quickly dispel

But may we not rationally use our faith as 
well as our reason in Spiritual Matters

7022 [1478] Too much faith is placed by man 
upon every thing which he believes 
superior to himself

If you are now living in the Corporeal World you 
probably do not remember your belief when in the 
Spiritual World. - but may I ask you. if you
The Existence of God.

The Argument from Design - is invaluable as an illustration 
but invalid as a demonstration - our belief in the existence 
of a living God - the source of all life - the fountain of all 
Law. is based ultimately on a fact of Consciousness.

[?] a. God is past finding out. - The fact of a Spiritual being - 
putting so unlooked for a question - took me by surprise 
and I fell back upon the usual proof "That of Design" 
but it is very doubtful "that design demonstrates the 
undemonstrable. - Infinitude of quality and especially 
the Infinitude of an infinite number of qualities, is 
insusceptible of definition; and the indefinable cannot be 
proposed as a Theorem. so that our GOD is, demonstrably 
by reason, as well as assuredly to Christian faith - past finding 
out. -

The Demonstration a Posteriori = by Descartes

"When I reflect upon myself, I know not only that I am an 
imperfect [work] thing. incomplete and dependant on another - 
one which lends and aspires ceaselessly to do something better and 
greater than itself, but I know. also that He on whom I depend 
possesses in himself all those great qualities to which I aspire -

First Meditation
90

You believe in God and in Jesus Christ as a Mediator

7023 Whatever my belief may have been, I 
never attained the least happiness, and 
yet I know it all.

Is it a curse that to me there is no 
Eternity - or is it [?] that innate feeling 
of right which I possess, that triumphs 
over all, worldly or Spiritual - and can 
pass through all, even the torments 
of Hell, and yet remain true to that 
feeling because I believe it to be right

Although I have lived and 
died, and lived again & again, died, 
and passed through every thing 
that the most diseased imagination 
could picture, yet I have always retained 
the same opinion

I believe it from the reasonings 
of the man and the knowledge of a 
Spirit -

You yet have doubts - you are also unhappy do 
you ever pray. to God - for help when in doubt & 
[?]

7024 What evidence is there that a God exists? ['a']

The Evidence in a Material sense is, that every, living 
existing thing is made with evident design to 
fulfill a designed end I propose, and as our worldly 
knowledge increases, we become more & more aware 
that these existing things - fulfill that designed 
end better than any other thing could do, this 
proves a designer - which we are content to call 
the Universal Mind - God.

7025 And that is all - Nature Springs 
Other being of a Neuronal GOD. 
"[Be?many] sum to think there is something noble in the belief of a future, and a celebration, and of a Father in Heaven, as a personal Deity; cannot conceive of the unselfish- sublimity of a more philosophical view of things. But what can be more impressive than the idea of the Infinite and the Eternal Omnipresent Law and principle of Nature" /  P.A. Sem of Man's Nature p. 189
" I do not say therefore that there is an GOD.  but that it is [?] Irreverent to imagine that [?] A person." GA p. 240.
" There is no theory of a GOD, of an Author of Nature of an Origin of the Universe, which is [????therly]  repugnant, to my faculties; which is not ( to my feelings) so [?] as to make one blush; so misleading as to make me mourn. I can now hardly believe that it was I who once was [?] with scarcely any recoil from the Theology; on Paley's "Natural Theology" 
with pleasure at the ingenuity of the Mechanic- God he thought he who recommending to the [?] of his leaders. " Miss Marteneau Ind p. 207

91

from nothing, and one event follows 
another as the natural (succession?) 
which must take place, but there is no 
evidence to show us that nature is [?] 
by a supreme head.

If you who have passed thro' the [horrors?] of Hell 
in your Spirit State, & suffered under more powerful 
Spirits who also had a Superior - may we not from a 
Spiritual point of View, deem it evident that for 
the Good, there is a State of bliss - of Good Spirits & 
a Chief, a ruler, God.

7026 I recognize the laws of Evil but not 
of good.

I cannot think that the world was 
created for a good purpose. and I 
know that all beyond it, is dark & 
void - full of worse evils than the earth

But your unhappy experience of the gloomy 
abodes of Evil, does not prove or persuade me to 
believe there are not realms of light & happiness

7027 Cast side from your mind all 
those feelings & opinions that have 
been instilled into it by a spirit.

Could I possibly do so should I thereby increase 
my happiness even on this earth

7028 I meant but for a moment.

I beg. pardon if I spoke too hurriedly I will 
await your Communication

7029 Cast aside all party feeling for any 
particular religion, and then tell me 
what you believe to be, the Origin 
of all religion
92

Your question embraces a vast deal too much for me 
to answer failed to do it. because he was 
a materialist - I answer - Spiritualism -

7030 And you believe this to be the foundation 
of all Religion

Yes I do. - my reasons are -

That in the earliest Ages of Man's existence, all men 
knew by their visible apparition of the reality of 
Spiritual existences, Man according to his nature 
entered into Communion with them - Good with Good 
Evil with Evil - The Jews led by their [?] & [?] 
ultimately resulted in Christianity - & others [?] 
under the guidance of Evil Spirits into all the 
Idolations of [Zabianism?] & other like Religions 
since become obsolete - but with an influence 
still existing over all the Pagan World.

7031 When we see the numerous different 
Religions, the very many that exists 
in the World - the great differences that 
exist between them. - The abuse that they 
hurl at each other, and the directly 
opposite opinions which they hold 
When you look upon these different 
sects with an unbiassed mind you 
must feel that they are all wrong. & 
then materialism is the only choice 
you have left by which you can escape 
either

Allow me to object Your question was as to the 
origin of all religions - not their relative - [?] [chief?] 
or [?] - I do not believe any existing Religion 
to be the only True one. I no more believe in the
The Builder of this Universe was wise.
He planned all souls, all systems, planets, particles,
the plan he shaped his worlds and aeons by 
Was - Heavens! - was thy small nine & thirty Articles?

93

Divine origin of [?] than in the Holy Coat of [?] 
nor that the Roman or Protestant priest can forgive 
us our Sins any more than the [working?] virgin of 
[7032] or the [bleeding?] Crucifix of. 
but I do believe in the Doctrines of Christ as laid 
down by him in the Books of the New Testament

7032 If you believe that you must favor 
one religion

I say look upon them all as 
level and then you will see the 
inconsistences and vileness that exists 
in them all.

A. Faith. is not a religion, I am a Christian but I 
do not believe in the infallible 39 articles of the 
Protestant or the 999 of any other religion, it would 
not matter to me whether I prayed [to] in a Church 
or Chapel or a Mosque - prayer is Spiritual - & whether 
I was shouldered by a Jew or Christian or a Turk 
would not avail me. - but you are Yourself the 
best advocate against Materialism, as you allow 
yourself to be & to have been both Corporeally & Spiritually 
unhappy.

7033 I did not say that I was a materialist 
but I believe them to be the only men 
who have a Chance of comfort here & 
hereafter, because I believe that they 
have no consciousness of what takes 
place after death.

That they as it were live in a 
world created by themselves for [?] 
that no alternation takes place farther 
than the Transformation from the 
bodily to the spiritual life -
94

That there they sleep on, still knowing 
nothing of what takes place, beyond 
their own sect.

Do you then believe that Men in the Spirit World 
live on in the Same [?] as when on earth, That he 
who lived a Materialist on earth - Yet finds himself 
an inhabitant, of the world beyond the grave without 
being altered his belief. - & that they view each 
other with that quintessence of hatred the odium 
Theologicum -

7034 I believe that every other religion 
continues abusing each other as they 
do in this world, but worse, and that 
they never arrive at the light point

The materialists know that they 
are right, and hold themselves apart 
in a body from the other Disputants

But when a Materialist Soul. finds on entering 
an existence which he had ever denied = that he in 
his Corporeal life had been so wrap't in [?], would 
he not then be open to conviction

7035 They cannot believe themselves in 
[?], it is only you who believes 
them so, they feel happy in their 
own conviction here, and they are so 
hereafter.

Yes but their's is the happiness of ignorance and 
I should not wish for that, in spite of the proverb 
"Where ignorance is bliss 'tis' folly to be wise."

7036 But if they continue in that happiness 
here and hereafter, why seek to alter 
it.

But can happiness be stationary, do they not
95
a spiritual rise, greater happiness, & increasing
knowledge.

7037  The happiness which he enjoys appears
the greatest because he knows no others.

Your argument appears to me in my limited view
fallacious - on earth the greatest happiness of a sot
may be in getting drunk - but that cannot be compared
with the laborious happiness of a refined & learned mind
The ideot may be truly happy - but who would not
rather be an unhappy philosopher"

7038  One person's happiness is not to be
judged by another's --
    The materialists happiness is
different both spiritually & bodily from
other mens while on earth.  he feels
that he has no dissension because he
has no belief -
    No fear of constantly doing wrong
because he feels there are no rewards or
punishments - and he lives in happy 
Harmony --  and amongst all men on
Earth you will no find any more kinder
to their fellow man or more charitable
than materialists --

That I have found this life to be correct, my most
esteemed friends have been materialists - the kindest
hearted. & most moral of my friends have been materialists
& I have always found religious bigotry - & selfishness -
inseparable --

7039  They are the most peaceful men, they
are the most humane, and they are the
most happy, and yet I cannot be one
of them, because I cannot contract my
belief to theirs, while I know more --


96

That has also been my case, although for the greatest 
portion of my life of no particular sect - , I could never 
be a materialist because from my earliest childhood 
I have from some innate cause been a believer in 
spiritualism.

7040  The protestant seems to place unbounded 
belief upon the Bible - It is only because 
their grandfathers believed it before them 
It is handed down hand had it [?] as an 
inspired volume. and therefore they 
believe it ------- 
[*This response 
came so fast that 
I lost some words 
here.*] 

7041 ---- but if we look for the origin of 
the Bible, we have not one particle of 
evidence that it is not what it seems -

It is idle for us to argue in favor of a belief which 
neither of us can embrace - You must, & I do 
believe in an all ruling power. - Can you withstand 
me while I exorcise you to depart. -

7042  I know not, care not, you may have 
a power to drive me away. I have 
used a larger power than that, but 
how could that change my opinion 
my [power] knowledge or my belief.

Because I would only call upon a good power, 
to do so. - The Supreme

7043  I recognize no supreme Power of Good

But that does not prove that Supreme Goodness 
is not /Adonic/

7044  But I believe that I could prove it to 
an unprejudiced mind -

Prejudice is but a term - When another differs from us absolutely 
we term him prejudiced, but it is only a term, I 
cannot at my will blot out my belief. and I
97
cannot conceive of the possibility of my forming an 
opinion on any subject unbiassed by any previous 
knowledge - in any other sense, I will listen to 
you with an unprejudiced mind.

7045  You would not because you are even 
now talking to me with a conviction 
so ingenuously put into your mind before 
hand that I am wrong - and I regret 
that any man could be so far the 
minion of a spirit, as to cast aside 
[thro] the opinions he had formed through 
a life, merely because a spirit has 
informed him that it is wrong, with 
no argument even between you., you 
allow him to be right in every thing

I explained.

7046  Will you allow me to appear again

Will you appear on Tuesday - if I call you

7047  I will on Tuesday Week

Can you in that state tell me the purport of 
this letter

7048 I cannot

7051 1476  It has not.

As it will be more convenient than the Crystal may I
call Mr Anderson into it

Lately when Emma inspects the mirror more particulrly

me with a remedy.

7053  1478  No answer.

I was at my friend Mr Lea's last Friday & his wife's
Vision has much improved  I hope now Mr Lea
will better regulate his feelings -

7054  1479  I am afraid that he will never have 
any very great success.

Is the spirit who appeared last Tuesday as Joseph
Balsamo - the Atmospheric Spirit of a now living
man

7055  1480  He is.

Is he in any way connected with [GAWS?]

7056  1481  No answer.

May I ask in what relation the Joseph Balsamo who
appears when I call at Mr Lea's and who is so well
versed in the Tables of Rotalo formerly in his possession
stands to the one who appears in our Crystal under
that name.

7057  1482  He appeared last Tuesday.  I do not
know all that he said

He appeared last Tuesday & entered into a defence of
Materialism but he does not appear to have any
Knowledge of the [?] Rotalo. - like the one at Mr. Lea's

& will not therefore ask you for instructions unless 
you wish to give them 

1484
7059  I will wait until you have the cards

Dr Travis has sent me his second question which 
I will ask with your leave at once without comment

Dr. Ts. 2nd Q'n   Is mans will free.

1485
7060  CA   Every Man has a free will, but it can 
be and often is put under subjection 
by others.

Dr T. 3rd Q'n.  In what does free will consist.

1486
7061  CA The will acting without instigation, 
[suggestion] subjection, or suppression 

May I ask if I am to return that as an answer to the 
question proposed.  or have you any further opinion 
to offer.

1487
7062  I have answered his question sufficiently

May I ask for my own information on this subject 
& without any reference to Dr T's question. - your 
views of the Doctrine of Predestination, Free Will & Fate 
about which such endless controversies are held by Men 
seeing that I cannot reconcile my belief in Mans 
Free Will with my belief in the power of predicting 
events by Astrology, Cards & other Divinations

1488
7063  All things take place in succession 
and every moment of a mans life must 
be taken up by events so long as he
[*100*]
[*7063 1488*] is in life there must be something that 
can be noticed
one thing must of necessity follow 
another in which mans will is not 
concerned.
Thus it can be predicted or shown 
that a man will be doing some particular 
thing at some particular time, and he 
too often believes that it must be so, 
and that by striving against it he cannot 
avoid it.
He believes that it is destiny while 
in reality it is only one thing arising 
from anther. a natural succession
Now were he to exercise his will 
in opposition to this, he would be 
convinced that he was wrong. for precisely 
at the time he would have done what 
had been predicted had he not known it 
he may be doing exactly the contrary
He falls into the error of believing 
that he must do things because he is 
[not] ordained, and this is keeping his 
will in subjection.
There is an aphorism in Astrology perhaps better 
supported than any other. The effects of ♄ upon 
the M[?]. If at Birth ♄ evilly Configurated it at 
a certain distance from the M[?]. the year that [?] 
comes by direction to the cusp — is one of downfall 
to his Trade, fortune, & credit — & even when ♄ transits 
the M[?]. the native suffers in reputation from the 
[?] signified by ♄ in the [radix?]. is that not so.
[*7064 1489*] Yes, but even in those cases the
107

attacks may be scarcely felt

I am in my own persons an exempt. of the [?] 
[?] is now & has for sometime been transmitting my 10th. 
& I need not say how I have suffered by my fathers 
folly - this as I had long since predicted, & as it 
was beyond my control. I may say it was predestined 
tho thanks to your advice I have not suffered as I 
certainly should have done but for that. may I not

7065 170 Yes. but you will allow that the effects 
which you would otherwise have felt 
have been softened -

My will has acted instead of your 
own.

I can feel by your explanation, that if a man falls 
into a river leading to a cataract. - if believing in 
predestination he subjects his will to his belief, he is 
[?] down the stream & lost - whilst the man who 
in the same circumstances by his will opposes his fate 
struggles successfully & reaches the bank. have 
I caught your meaning

7066 1491 Perfectly you are right

The natural succession of things must 
take place, were it not so the world would 
at once stop. and therefore it must be 
known what event will succeed the last

And that knowledge existing some 
where is able to be brought to those who 
are [distined?] - but of those who are destined 
can put another event which they choose 
better in the place of that which is 
predicted to them so that no vacuum 
is left, and the succession of things still 
take place, then he exercises his free will.
102

I presume you do not ask me to send Dr T. these 
responses -

7067 1492 All my Answers are at your disposal 

I think that as Dr [Tranis?] is a disbeliever in Spiritualism 
altho a very candid one. places his questions so curtly 
before you. I will only send the answers you gave 
thereto - [?] this latter portion to another time

7068 1498 Probably it would be best that the 
answer should be sent first.

When at my friend Lea's - Mrs. Lea's little daughter 
then some years dead appeared - & gave her some 
consolatory advice - may I ask if it was the child 
-soul. that appeared or only her likeness - & the advice 
given by Lero. the spirit of the mirror

7069 1494 I do not know.

May I ask if you are aware of any law of Spiritual 
Apparition which would prevent a child appearing 
who had died about 2 or 3 years old. 

7070 1495 None are yet passed the 7 Sphere that 
could hold any [Communication?] with man

Children who die young pass thro' 
all the spheres. and do not return, it is 
possible for their likeness to do so. and 
that would be unknown to themselves 
and I may say as I have often said 
before, no knowledge exists of earth 
or any thing appertaining to earth 
when the spirit enjoys happiness, I 
meant that of a deceased person.

Then I presume with deference that perhaps Lero Mrs 
Leas GS. knowing the childs state of bliss & the mothers 
anxiety, caused the likeness to appear & gave the response

7071 1496 It may
103

It would perhaps not be advisable for me to ask all that 
I could wish about Cagliostro, but it seems inscrutable to me 
that one who has twice thrown off this mortal [?] should still 
have his mind tormented with doubts as to the existence of a 
Deity - I can form no conception of it.

7072 1497 I will tell you

When he was born for the first time it was 
intended in the natural succession of all 
things, that he should have died received 
his reward or punishment according to his 
merits or demerits, but things which have [fired?] 
on his life, things which he himself altered 
changed his destiny - when the body was 
persecuted and [?] down, it died but 
the spirit lived - It never became purified 
and he had committed in life that which 
without great purification could never have 
been forgiven 

When the body had died the 
spirit remaining so strong and so wickedly 
attached to evil and to the world that 
it could not rise with other spirits, and 
thus without the least knowledge of 
happiness. without the least sympathy 
for good - with a love for every thing 
evil - he endured and again passed 
out of the atmosphere only finding then 
the wandering and evil spirits congenial 
with his own. - And he again lived 
on earth, but instead of improving he 
was worse than before.

This time he was endowed with 
Supernatural Knowledge but it was of
104

1497
7072  Evil, and he then willingly bound 
himself to Evil he earnestly wished for 
things which [that] he could not have. Evil 
Spirits tempted him with them, and 
he promised that if he had a Soul, it was 
at their disposal   he always loved 
he always loved materialism although 
he knew it was. wrong and could not 
believe in it, or rather he could not find 
enjoyment in it because he had that 
knowledge.
     He wished to believe there 
existed nothing, while he knew there 
was something.
     A terrible death closed his short
though as terrible a life. and the 
horrors of his situation after that death 
you had a specimen of when you saw 
him in your Crystal
     The spirit which now inhabits 
the earth in the form of a mortal has 
had no human birth and his punish't 
now is that he clings so long upon 
the earth until he can get his mind 
to acknowledge his own unworthiness
     Until he is humiliated & driven 
to seek refuge at the foot of the Cross.
     When he has acknowledged his 
sinfulness as a mortal and his 
repentance for his terrible life. and his 
belief in the True religion then will he 
be allowed to die in peace.
     The memory of the past will
105

be buried in oblivion and [?ve] [???o]
[u???olly] [?i?s?] that his spirit will begin
its progress.

     the Consultors of the Holy Inquisition have ever

I cannot without horror picture to myself the fate 
of a man thus tenderly commiserated (in print -) by 
the Reverend priests of that Earthly Hell the 
Holy Inquisition

Your kindness toward me induces me to make a remark
which would by most be deemed presumptuous = yet altho'
but too painfully come of my own Sins of omission and
commission. Yet may I not by your means be the
instrument of inducing the unhappy spirit of Joseph
Balsamo, to seek assistance where only it is to be found
1560  Through your Assistance I feel [sins?]
7082  has made some progress
towards the Truth.  And I cannot see
why you should not be instrumental
to others besides him

My hope was founded on the [?] that I have
read in [Guinan?] Authors especially, so many instances
of the Spirits of Mortals long since deceased having
sought the prayers of the living, naming [???] prayers
to be read and even Expressing their [?] [?]
happenings in the Spirit slate by these means

7083 1507 Joseph Balsamo is now upon Earth and 
he must now corporeally be convinced of 
the Truths of the "Divine" Religion before 
the Spirit can be released, the Soul allowed 
to progress.

I was much surprized when he appeared at his attemptd 
a defense of Materialism, in our mirror

7084 1508 But whilst being there you must understd 
it is the Atmospheric Spirit of [a living]

I am aware of that, yet altho. he appeared to know & 
indeed asserted that he had previously lived & died 
Yet he appeared ignorant of the Circumstances of his 
former life - in either State for he Surprized me by asking 
"What evidence is there that a God exists? - can any 
indwellers of the Spirit World, exist with such a belief.

7085 1509 There are some that can, but it is 
from their determined opposition to every 
thing good

When I am conversing with his Atmospheric Spirit 
in the Mirror or Crystal would my Arguments even if 
convincing to his At Spirit be of any avail in altering 
his belief in the Corporeal Body. - ie could I [?] 
convince him -

7086 1510 It would. - You could do so

                 in Heaven with all things of man


No. 59 That the universal Heaven in one Complex

May I solicit your views of some of Emanuel Swedenborgs
Assertions in His treatise of "Heaven & Hell"

7088  
1572  do so.

I read .87. 88, 89. 90 - then 81- and 94.

7089
1573  He wrongly calls the atmosphere Heaven
but neither are in the shape of a Man
were any Creation so, then the Creator could
not be the supreme ruler, because the 
creator and that created would be the same
Man is the only Image that exists
of the [Creator] Maker.
The forms of the Atmosphere & of Heaven
I gave you some time since -
of the communion of Spirits with
Man which he wrongly Calls Correspondents
he is in part correct.

I read. 59

7090
1574  The Divine Man is the Son of God
other than this no Angel knows.

I read 62.

7091
1575  He is there entirely wrong - There are separate
Societies of Angels because some even in
the same state are [superior to others] much
better than others
But these Societies have no bearing, no
form, they all recognize one Government
and they hold communion with all other
Angels, not of their own Society

Swedenborg, was not only a Man of vast learning
110

but there is every human reason to suppose that he
would not willingly have promulgated a falsehood [for]
to have gained a Kingdom - if therefore he is in error
on these Spiritual Subjects, it is most deniable. they
should be pointed out, his followers at the present
day being so numerous, Are You aware of the views
he held.

1576  I am aware of the life of Emanuel Swedenborg
of his Faith and of his Knowledge, and
Language seems insufficient to do
justice to his character as a Man.
He had one fault that of too much
zeal and enthusiasm in the religious
opinions which he believed, this led
him into error - 

7092 
But no man more truly believed that
which he taught, and which is now followed
by many, than he did, and none was
more just.

But if his views are founded in trust, then those of 
his followers who are numbered in England alone by 
thousands.  one in enrs too, it it not ingently necessary 
that those trins should be lineded. 

1517  Is is deniable but it is not essentially
Necessary.

7093
That a Correct belief in Spiritual matters is not necessary
to Salvation, is Certain, but his followers are apt to look
to his Works more than to the Scriptures for their guidance
or rather I should say - are apt to View the Scriptures
And him - may I ask in what parts you consider
his belief and doctrines are most in Error?
111

1518  Ask me that question next Tuesday
Evening

7094
I read 294
May I solicit your view

7095 1519  It is right

I read 295

1520
He classes the Heavens or more strictly speaks
the Heavens under different heads. This is
wrong They are all the same spirits
progressing and those which at one time
occupy the lower at another occupy the
Highest.
These spirits are as he states in conjunction
with man, they are his Guardian Spirits
and it is according to his own merits or demerits
to what degree of greatness these spirits belong
and altho they change the man, the man
as often Changes them. for if his mind
tend more towards evil than good they are
driven from him & spirits of a lower order
though still good take the Change.
And it is the same with evil if the man's
mind balances towards good, then the evil spirits
are powerless and the good have the ascendency
and he gets a higher guardian spirit than
he had before.

7096
I read 299.

1521  It is so individually but it is not so
generally. - It is those wandering spirits
which I lately spoke of in connexion with
the American manifestations which have

7097
112
those things which appertain to Man

But did Swedenborg here mean that they literally ent'd
Mans Stomach attracted there by the decomposition
there taking place which was to them agreeable.

1522 
97?  
7098 
97?  
Yes and they did do so
Although not low enough and with much
different character from Evil Spirits, they
are very far lower than man and strange
as it may seem altho' Spiritual they
are more earthly more corrupted and
therefore every thing which appertains
to Earth. as to decomposition is to them
Natural, for it contains the Elements
by which they exist - and thus they are
drawn to that even within a Man. and
whilst there, their presence cannot but
Cause uneasiness, because the mans
Spiritual faculties rebels against their
intrusion and the mind is distressed

When therefore a Doctor by prescribing for his patient
a good dose of physic & thereby cleanses his - 
indegesto--Hypochondriac Stomach. - & so dispels the
Spirits, he becomes unknowingly an Exorcist

7099 1523  When there is no disease it is so

But many thousand pious & worthy persons Suffer
from Indigestion & Melancholia do these Spirits enter
the Stomachs of the good as well as of the Evil

7100 1524  Yes, but altho they Affect the Mind
& sometimes when very powerful
overthrow the reason., I have before
told you that insane people or possessed
113
they do not affect their knowledge or belief 

I read 311
May I ask how Swedenborg with such good intent towards
his fellow men could have been so misled

1525 
7101  Heaven existed before the world was created
The communion of Angels began at it's first 
existence and the Heavenly host was formed
of those who had never lived
     Since the world has been created
many additions have been made to
heaven by those who have departed from 
it. - 
     I should rather have said the 7th
Sphere which is generally known as Heaven. 
for none until after the day of judgement
will have perfect happiness, that is
happiness which cannot be encreased. 
     It was not of those angels fallen 
from Heaven upon Earth at the time of
creation and thence still lower into Hell
that made the beginning of the Evil Spirits

I read 316.

1526
7102  He rose as a spirit, with his earthly death 
died every thing human and that which
rose again & appeared afterwards was
purely spiritual 
      He descended a Spirit, a spark, 
as it were of the light & glory of the Father
and the Mission fulfilled for which he 
descended, he ascended again as bright 
and Glorified to make one with the
Father from when he departed.
Matt.  28  v 6 "He is not here for he is risen, as he said
                          Come, and see the place where the Lord was laid"
Mark.  16.  6  "He is risen - He is not here; behold the place 
                         where they laid him."
Luke.  24.   3  "And going in they found not the body of 
                         the Lord Jesus.
114
But the General belief by Christians on the Resurrection of the Corporeal
Body is perhaps grounded upon the body of Jesus not being
found in the Sepulchre

1527
7103   When that spirit had escaped from that 
body, its power was infinite and having 
made use of that body for every purpose
for which it was necessary what more easy 
[*/See No.      /*]         than to make it fall into dust. 

When in Company with any one suffering from pain, I
Cannot suppress the desire to relieve them & this appears to

7104  It is necessary and it is also right that 
you should study yourself as much as 
others.
     You are aware that in Mesmerising
others you lose your own power and you 
do yourself harm.  more or less as the case
may be which you mesmerise

Good Evening  Have you thought since of our conference the
other Evening

7114 Yes I have

For an indweller of the Spirit world to argue in favor of materialism
is to me an evident absurdity altho I am but a sorry logician
and for me to attempt to explain to you why through the
teachings of my Guardian Spirit I am content to believe the
great truths of Christianity through faith, altho opposed to my
reason.  would take too long a time.   but I may so far justify
myself, when I percieve in every day life, the most learned
Men, the most acute logicians, the most laborious of Investigators
are led by their individual "reason"  to differ in toto on "physical"
Facts  which are almost physically  nay  mathematically
demonstrable. -- how then can men become by "reason"
unanimous on Metaphysics - by what argument could I
prove to the learned, the "unprejudiced" Materialist Dr. John
Elliotson  / whom of all men I should most like to convince/
that your apparition in this Mirror & your arguments are
not the result of a diseased action of my brain, a morbid
activity of one lobe - of some antagonistic duality of my
cerebrum or an unlintentional Biologyzing of my Seers
mind.  what would the "reason" of so staunch, so 
unprejudiced a materialist say to the assertions you
last evening made to me. -- May I hot therefore
possess a belief through Faith - in Spiritualism, however
much opposed to my materialist reason.  
117

7115 Altho' I argue in favor of Materialism, I am 
not a materialist myself, I cannot be so with 
the Knowledge I possess of Spiritual life, 
but I have said and I still say, that their 
belief makes them the happiest -

And it is a belief that produces the finest 
Specimens of humanity, and I say this that 
were it possible for all the world to be materialists, 
for every child to be educated in that belief, and 
for all to die in that firm belief, there would be 
no hereafter. for I believe this that a mans 
opinions and actions and belief in life constitutes 
his world in afterlife, and therefore were they 
all to have but one opinion, they would be 
stronger than the evil spirits who combat with 
them, the evil would cease to exist, and man 
would have no soul - because he would have no 
Knowledge of any, he would have no wish 
for happiness, and being good men as all 
Materialists are no need of rewards or 
punishments, and therefore no hopes of the 
one and no [no] need of the other, the soul 
would cease to exist when life ended.

I can see no advantage to man in living as you describe 
in Error here even if he could thereby preclude joy or 
Suffering in the Spirit World - Supposing such a belief led 
to his "Unconscious" existence in the Spirit World, it would but be 
an Eternity of Waste

7116 You reason thus but a Materialist, would not do so 
and in not doing so would constitute his 
happiness.
118

Your argument appears to me fallacious, & we need not argue 
as to a world which does not exist and which cannot exist 
because it is opposed to the Divine will, as proved by the 
existing World - & on this earth there now exist Men in every 
degree of Knowledge from the Savage to the Savan. & there 
is but little room to hope. it will ever be much otherwise 
unless by the Immediate Act of the Allpowerful

7117 Those beings who are not civilized must have 
a Materialist faith; they know of no hereafter 
therefore they do not believe it. leaving all 
those out of the question who have not received 
an Education, and allowing that all those 
children who are not yet born, might be 
Materialists then I say it would be possible 
for them to make the Spiritual existence cease.

Can it be possible that you who in difiance of all Known 
laws which govern the human race have twice entered 
the Spirit life, can believe that a mortal dieing with 
the belief - that he has no Soul, that there is no reward or 
punishment - can thereby Evade the Judgment or nullify 
the Laws which govern the Spirit World.

7118 No. Those who have died, have not been 
Powerful enough for that, they await their 
Errors, but were those yet to come, to believe 
there would be no existence, I saw again they 
would have their whole happiness in this 
life, and with this life they would cease 
to Exist. because they would be stronger than 
the Evil which is now stronger than Man.

I recognize Good & Evil but I believe that 
the greatest good is man & that the Evil is
119

is the Spiritual World The only heaven 
that is to be found in this world is here, the 
next is all Hell.

For 30 years I have felt a great interest in all concerning You 
and I cannot but express my great regret at your present 
Views, I yet have hopes you will see fit to alter them

7119   do you then think that a man could 
change his belief at Will.

No, but If I saw a man, "a reasoning being" walking a 
straight path deeper & deeper into the Shades of doubt 
& Hell, yet earnestly professing to seek light - do you 
not think if I told him that by turning the directly 
Contrary way he would reach the realms of Light and 
Heaven, which he had so long and vainly followed 
his own path to find - it might not induce him to try it.

7120   Probably it might do so -
     Were I to see a gleam of light then 
indeed I should follow it, but I myself 
believe now that nothing which man could 
offer as an argument could induce me 
to change my opinion because I feel that 
I know the world from having been upon 
it 3 times, and I know the spirit world 
from being upon it twice, had I when 
there been given a hope, however slight 
that something better existed, then might 
I have changed
     But indeed the utmost torments 
which man can pass thro' in this world
[*"Alas poor Ghost."*] is Elysium to those they pass in the next 

May I then ask if you [ever] saw in the Spirit World
120
beings so beautiful so self-radiant with light & loveliness 
that the fairest of earths daughters could not compare
with them & yet not believe that they must inhabit
a sphere where all was radiant light & happiness &
Heaven.

7121  I never did - all there was dark, terrible 
frightful - too frightful to contemplate
and Oh the Horror of returning again
to such a state.

Your reply pains me - remembering as I do our first
meeting - yet we in these mirrors behold those spirits
of Sight --

7122  They only exist in the Imagination, all
those things can be accounted for by a 
Physical Law.

By what physical law can you explain Your apparition
[here], & arguments contrary to our views or belief. 

7123  The laws of Nature are as much unknown
to man as those of spirits

Am I then to consider that your apparition here & the
arguments you have used.  the assertions you have made
[results?] from a disordered imagination & that they are
to be explained away by some occult Law of Physics

7124  No but I do not appear as an Angel of
light, I am but the second existence of
a mortal -- a spirit  -- if you will  - but 
I do not pretend to be a happy one.
   I cannot stay longer.

Will you appear next Tuesday Evening

7125   Why do you wish to see me.

Because in this material world, I believe there is

7127 1537 I will answer your other questions first

I have just learn by the Newspaper that E S. died

Circumstance

7128 1538 Yes

By his death Mesmerism has lost a

You can call him as early as you wish

May I now place before you Dr Travis's question

7130 1540   do so
Free Will.
"The world would think itself free in its motion round the Sun
until it discovered the Laws of its motion, which determine its course
to be precisely what it is - a speck of dust whirling around & about
and filling its little place in the harmony of the Universe -- 
     Free will! The very idea is enough to make a democritus
roar with laughter, and a more serious thinker almost despair
of being men to reason (!)  to experience the advantages of knowledge
and the calming influence of a recognition of Universal Law &
neccessity "                     G  Atkinson   Law of Mans Nature 194.

     "When we finally have dismissed all notions of Subjection to a
Supreme lawless will,' exclaims Miss Martineau - all the
perplexing notions about sin and responsibility, & arbitrary
reward and punishment - and stand free to see where we
are,  and to study our own Nature, and recognize our own
Conditions -  the relief is like that of coming out of a cave
full of painted shadows under the free sky with the Earth
open around us to the Horizon - what a new perception
we obtain of "the beauty of holiness" - the loveliness of a 
healthful moral Condition - accordant with the laws of
Nature, and not with the requisitions of Theology
                                     Law of Mans Nature p. 219
122

Dr T's 4th Question

You have said that the will is a power - that it is 
the mind, (or that in which the power resides) and 
that it is thought (a result produced by the exercise of 
power.) that is, that it is 1st. an attribute, 2nd, that 
into which the attribute exists - and 3rd, an effect of the 
exercise of the attribute - In which of these senses is 
it that the will is free.?

7131 1547 I cannot answer it so shortly as I have 
done those before it.

Will and free will are the same power - 
one is that which man always possesses 
and no circumstances can take away. - 
the other may be said to be an attribute 
which the different positions & conditions 
of Man. strengthen or suppress

Mind & matter are so nearly related that 
what effects one has influence over the other 
and thus in those nations of the Earth 
where slavery exists there is no free will.

The will is an earnest desire after any 
existing thing, and this no slavery a bondage 
can suppress.

While free will is a determination to gain 
the desired end against all opposition, and 
thus the Serfdom of the body trammels 
the mind, and the will is [?] to an 
almost animal level, but nearer us and 
amongst civilized and educated beings 
we find the same results tho from different 
causes.
123.

7131 1547 In Electro [Onology?], In Clairvoyance and in 
Mesmerism Free will is entirely suppressed 
and the will is entirely under the subjectn. 
of another - and in other cases the Civilized 
& well educated man who possesses a Strong 
free will can by reasoning have sufficient 
influence over one who possesses less knowlge. 
than himself -

Many a man has been instigated 
to do things which his free will would 
have revolted at

Thus Will is a natural attribute of the 
Mind

Free will is within the power of Man

The 5th question[s] is in a great part answered by your responses 
I will however place it before you

Dr T's 5 Question

If Freedom is an attribute of the will, how 
can this attribute be something taken from the will, 
as it is said or implied in the answer to questions 
2 & 3 that it may be? that is to say - If Man 
has a freewill how can this free will be otherwise 
& [have?] free under any Circumstance?

7132 1542 It is crushed by the Superior will of 
those who have power over the body

The peculiar manner in which these 
questions are placed will not 
allow them to be answered so satisfactorily 
as I could have wished

Allow me to observe that altho Dr. T is a sceptic as to 
the "Spiritual objectivity" of these apparitions yet he is 
I sincerely believe a very Candid Engineer & I am sure 
124

that in whatever form he may place his questions 
he would wish with me that your responses should be 
quite untrammel'd

7133 1543 I quite understand that

The questions are easily to be answered 
by a man in like manner to which 
Dr Travis asks them -

He dwells upon the words whereas 
I answer the ideas more than the words 
in which they are expressed

To a man the words only contain 
the meaning, I cannot confine myself 
sufficiently to the words to answer their 
meaning solely - the meaning of the 
[?] will [?] itself and I make 
use of words which will allow of being 
cavilled at.

I wish in future when Joseph Balsamo 
appears to you that you could copy his 
communications separate from those others 
which you receive, as when your notes 
go to Mr Owen. I do not wish his views 
and Ideas to go with them. to you 
I think it will be quite Apparent that 
he is in great Error - to Mr Owen it may 
not be so, so lately impressed as he is 
with the belief of Spirituality there may 
in it to call back to his own 
Materialism and it may awaken ideas 
and feelings which were before dormant.

Although I have now for so many years devoted my
1544

"As for the resolution of matter into forces, it does not to my mind 
convey any notion of immaterial existence - I observe you ([?]) 
use the words Spirit and Spiritual forces in regard to the virtues of the 
Magnet and the mutual operation of Billiard Balls - I do not 
object to the word, understanding as I do that [the word] by Spiritual 
you doubt mean 'immaterial:' but I should not have ventured 
to use the word to you. I suppose the German term "[?]" 
is of the same class, I wish we had a term [us?] people in general 
mean by "Spiritual" that which is not matter and which is 
in Antagonism with it - I do not know what term we have 
but "force" -

Miss Martineau

Laws of Mans Nature p 157

1545 Matter.

"We know that Nature presents to us a system of forces; and Faraday 
I believe conceives matter to be nothing but a system of Forces, but I 
cannot conceive of forces as an abstract from matter, or being matter,

But the question is perhaps beyond all ordinary powers of 
sense and reasoning. I once conceived of matter as a system 
of Forces; but now I inquire "What is force?" and require an 
origin or cause of force, and this brings me to where I set out; 
to two things; matter and its forces as properties

sparetime to the study of Occult philosophy in its 
various branches of Astrology Alchemy Animation 
Cabalism & Spiritualism - yet my increasing knowledge 
only shows more distinctly my almost hopeless 
ignorance upon these Subjects, and but for your 
Spiritual Knowledge it would appear insurmountable 
and unfortunately mans limited faculties compel 
him to use words or terms to express things, which bear 
a [?] of renderings - more particularly in the words 
Spirit and matter - may I ask

What is the Nature of Spirit in the final and abstract 
Sense of the Word.

7134 1544 Spirit is the all pervading & animating 
power of the Universe, the life of all 
that exists

Every thing that is incomprehensible 
to man is Spiritual 

All power which is invisible, which 
has no material existence

The Spirit, I mean now that which 
is so nearly connected with Man, 
not the universal spirit, desires its existce 
from his Material body the mind, 
[is] the reason, Thought and the will 
from his Spiritual body and emanate 
from him as Scent from flowers.

The flower is the Material and 
the Visible body, the Scent is the 
Spiritual, still the most powerful body.

What is the Abstract Nature of Matter

7135 1545 Matter is earthly, all that which is
126
Visible and Comprehendible to Man
     The Corporeal body is but an image 
created him Natural  elements which
exist and thro' which the [body works] 
spiritual body works. 
     Matter has only Animal senses 
possessed in common by all Creation 
it is the Spiritual body which  /animates/ 
/[*? elevates*]/   man beyond all 

But many I ask him can a Spiritual intelligence be 
an individual entity = & yet not partake of the nature of 
matter or substance. 

1546
7136   The same as a Mans mind is 
separate & individual - as soul. 

Is what man terms " Electricity"  Matter or spirit. 

1547
7137  Spirit 

Is Light matter or Spirit

1548
7138  Everything is Spiritual which is all 
pervading, those things only are material 
which are Visible to the eyes of Men 
only those things which are confined 
to earth. All beyond and 
                     is Spiritual

Then I am to conclude that "Light" in its abstract 
sense is Spiritual and also "Heat"

1549
7139  We call these an all pervading influence 
they are not material, but we do not 
call the Spirit. 

May I ask if you then only call that Spirit which is 
intelligent. 

1550
7140  Yes

Is Electricity and Mind Identical

1551
7141  Electricity is one of the powers of The Mind
127

May I ask if you are aware of the imponderable 
called Phosphorous & if the Mind is phosphorescent

7142 1552 That is inseparable from Electricity 

I will now proceed &c &c.

7143 1533 I will do so on next Tuesday week 

Can I see [EJ?]. this Evening and shall I call him 
into this mirror or the ES. Crystal.

7144 1554 He will appear in his own Crystal

I wish to continue the this Evening

I cannot do so next Tuesday

The Emperor Alexander [?] died suddenly on the

7145 1555 I think that the war will be over 
in the Spring

If you particularly wish to see ES. 
I will appear again when he leaves

8.30 PM ES. Crystal

Called ES. present Mr G.[?]T.

Here is a gentleman [from?] [?] Lavender Waistcoat, 
black Trousers [fulled?] shirt white neck cloth 
no Shirt Collar. No Wig - its ES.

My [Lord?]. May I first ask if you have any objection 
to being called.

7146 I have not. I have no title now.
May I ask if you are [Cognizant?] which is that is 
now falling [a??n]. 

7147 I think that [?], I had much 
[?] belonging to you.- [?]

In the last letter you [?inned] me with you [???imed]
to meet me again in [l????m] thing the Psychograph
[??ay] I ask of you [?] it

7148 Yes but I [?] confident [?] that the
intelligence I gained from it, so my
lurking was not correct, [?] [?]
before I left the [?enth] that [?] [?]
[??lly] developed.
May I ask your [?erci?] opinion as to the quality
of the spirits [??he] [fur????icra?c] by [?a??ings].

7149 I know them to be bad
I trust I shall reach happiness and 
I still believe as I did on Earth
that the prayers of those living are
beneficial to those deceased.
Since [yo??] departure from [??gland], I have been
[fee???] to [h??ively] after my opinion [?] the 
[S???ied] of the Trinity [??he] [die??ce] of the [????enent]

"And yet, amid the Hurry, toil, and strife, 
The claims, the urgencies, the whirl of Life, - 
The Soul - perhaps in silence of the night 
Has flashes, transient intervals of light; 
When things to come, without a shade of doubt, 
In terrible reality stand out. 
Those lucid moments suddenly present 
A glance of truth, as though the Heavens were [lent?]; 
And through that Chasm, of pure Celestial light, 
The future breaks upon the startled light; 
Life's rain persists; and Time's advancing pace, 
Appears with deathbed clearness face to face; 
And Immortality's expanse Sublime, 
In just proportion to the speck of Time; 
While Death, uprising from the Silent Shades, 
Spews his dark outline, as the Vision fades; 
In strong relief against the blazing sky 
Appears the Shadow [h]as it passes by, 
And tho' orwhelming to the [cazzled?] brain, 
There are the moments when the mind is sane; 
[?] then, a hope in Heaven - the Saviour's cross, 
Seen what they are, and all things, else are [dross?]

towards those among my own friends 
who still hold the opinions I did when 
on Earth and none more so than my 
friend Dr [Ashburner?].

My I ask if you obtained your belief in Jesus Christ 
before your decease or since you left this Earth.

7153 Some time before my decease I felt the 
want of something to rely my faith 
upon

I felt that unless I could find 
some supporter death without hope 
would be too terrible to [bear] endure & 
then I turned my mind in earnest 
prayer to the one God. and gradually 
as the body & work of the Spirit rose to 
almost gigantic power, my mind 
Continuing in prayer, the Holy radiance 
seemed to pour upon my Soul, 
I seemed elated and happy and then 
as I felt humanity and Spiritual 
Elevation at the same time I thought 
of God made Man - of the Divine 
Spirit with earthly feelings, I thought 
of his death, and then of his Resurrection 
to Eternal life, I thought that he 
could sympathize with me, and know 
my wants, and then as my mind 
wandered back over a long life and a 
very sinful one, I felt what need there 
was for that death upon the Cross 
I felt that by his blood my Sins 
might be washed away, and then I felt 
the Influence of the Holy Spirit, the
130

the Holy Ghost the Comforter and my 
Spirit passed unfettered from the body 
in the blessed assurance that my 
Redeemer liveth.

Shall I show this your answer to Dr Ashburner as 
I have a great wish that he should be placed on the 
one true path.

7153 Write to him tell him that the Spirit 
of his departed friend prays, that he 
will well weigh those things contained 
in the New Testament

If Dr A. raises any objection as to these replies really 
[?] from you - would you give me in your 
present state any Sign by which he might believe it

7154 I have no power to do that which 
would convince his bodily Senses, and do 
not address me now as though I yet 
lived, I am level now with the most 
humble that ever left the earth.

As my letters to you in your lifetime were very Voluminous 
do you think if your Son the present [?] has not 
already destroyed them he would return them to me 
If I applied for them

7155 - I think that he would.

Your Son might in return require your letters to me, 
which I should regret to prat with have I your sanction to 
retain them

7156 You have - I said then what I believed 
in my ignorance to be the Truth, and 
I have no wish that they should be 
destroyed.

As You have expressed your altered opinions on the 
subject of the Trinity at the time of your decease may
131

I ask if any passages of Scripture [?] to you at 
the time and what they were.

7157 I seemed to know the meaning of 
the whole, it seemed to show me so 
plainly, so indisputably that there was 
a Saviour of the world, and that one 
Jesus Christ.

Now his Lordships going -

May I ask if you will appear on Tuesday next if Called

7158 I will.

20' past 9 PM.

9.30 PM. C.A Mirror

Invoked the CA

The CA is here.

I referred to the Commn. received from ES. & his wish for 
me to write to Dr A

7159 1536 When do you intend writing to him 

I thought I would write to him on Thursday & see him 
on Sunday

7160 1557 The Spirit of the late Lord Stanhope 
will appear again next Tuesday, if 
you so wish it, I think I would defer 
writing to Dr Ashburner till after that 
time.

I presume there is no objection to my writing to the 
present Earl to request the return of my letters,

7161 1558 There is not, you can tell him how 
much you are interested in all these 
Subjects

May I ask if you have any Commn to make to me before 
commencing with the other subject

7162 1559 I have not.

My Seer has unfortunately suffered much from
132
luminous appearance in the mirror, paining her Eyes
May I ask if you can tell me how to remedy it

7163 1500   It is possible to have that without
injuring the Eyes.
I will now begin &c &c

10' past 11 PM ended,

8'10'PM             C.A. Mirror
8'                  Invoked the C A.
The C A.  in morning.
May I &c

7164 1561  do so

My young friend has lately suffered much pain in
her Eyes when Inspecting may I ask how we can 
prevent her suffering

7165 1562  No Answer

Repeated the question & the Response No

7166 1563  No Answer.

I have received this letter from a friend of my Father
will you favor me with Your advice

7167 1564  I am still of opinion that the greatest
service you could render him would
be to remove him from his family
but you must be sure that he was
entirely removed so that what
comforts he had might not be taken
away from him by them.
     I should advise you not to
increase the money you are in the 
habit of Lending him, but at the
same time I hope that you will
133

not allow his affairs to harass you, it 
does him no good but yourself harm 
believe me that what you have done 
has been for the best, and I shall be 
ever ready to give you any advice when 
you feel the necessity of asking it.

I will appear on purpose to do so 
at any time

May I ask if ES. will appear when called this Evg

7168 1565 He will

When in Genesis it is written, 'And the earth was 
without form and void and darkness was upon 
the face of the deep. does it mean that matter then 
existed in Chaos but by the addition thereto by the 
[?] [Will?] of the Spiritual existences Light Heat & 
Electricity. the Earth assumed its present shape & 
[conviction?] & [obeyed?] its present [form?] as a planetary body

7169 1566 The word of God sent forth Spiritual 
life into the mass of Material which 
had existed for Eternity before

Under the Influences which He 
forced down upon it, it expanded into 
Shape and the Spirit uniting with 
the Material [it] made Life -

The latter portion of your response induces me to ask 
if Spontaneous Existence is possible, there has for 
many years been much Controversy upon that Subject 
many great names in Science being both for & against 
it - May I ask if it is possible for any species 
of insect or Animalculae however small. to come at 
the present moment into Existence, without obeying the 
usual laws of procreation

7170 1567 They can, they do, do so
"Spontaneous Generation."

"One nearly pardons the believers in Spontaneous Generation 
on seeing these despised creatures so frequently [?] & 
propagate immediately that a suitable [?] for 
Colonization is afforded, that the Mystery is much 
cleared up when we look through the Microscope 
at a Voided threadworm, & see its body almost 
filled with Millions of Eggs, minute enough to pass 
through most [fillus?] & therefore probably distributed 
by [Olives?] & Subterranean [rills?], from Springs and 
Cisterns - when we find that one joint of a 
hundred jointed tapeworms contains enough [worms] 
germs to furnish every inhabitant of the globe 
with an image of itself, these latent lives must 
be continually passing down the line of [our?] [inter?] [times?] 
finding only in rare instances a station to stop at.

This is an unpleasant thought but it is some 
gratification to remember. that we of all Animals 
are best defended against such [?] by our 
possession of the sometimes despised act of Cooking, 
It is unlikely that any Eggs can live through 
the boiling temperature".

All the strange rare human parasites which 
fill the lists of the [?] have been found in 
Egypt Abyssinia & Ethiopia - it is will known that 
[?] & [?] fill the stomach of the inhabt 
of these regions with raw food & stagnant water which 
may be supposed to be peculiarly full of ora. & 
against the access of which cooking guards mor e
civilized nations"

Life exists in everything, and it is possible 
for animal life to be taken from vegetable 
life.

If that is so what limits are to be set to size, why 
have we no large animal hitherto unknown. Springing 
into existence

7171 1568 It is impossible for a sufficient 
quantity of matter to [use?] in one place 
to make one body of a large Animal

There is not sufficient of the same 
matter existent in one spot, it is [imminally?] 
[diffined?] therefore millions of minute 
Creatures can have being, while one of 
an immense size could not.

I thank you, I have hitherto held quite opposite 
views, unfortunately, in arguments even when founded 
upon Physical facts & things - degenerate into Theological 
Controversies as tho' Materialism & Spiritualism were 
ever to run counter to each other, instead of parallel 
A favorite Subject for dispute has been "which 
existed first the Cheese or the Cheesemite may I ask 
you that question.

7172 1569 The Cheese. - because it is an essence 
arising from the milk which gives 
the animal existence.

But although this Separate 
existence as it appears in Contradistinction 
to Nature. is allowed to those small 
creatures. and could exist where it the 
Divine will that it should do so [?] 
larger and amongst higher ones. by 
his wisdom & Providence it is stopped 
there and goes no farther
135

7172 1549 And here I think it must be observed 
by all who will give it attention how 
merciful, how thoughtful and how 
abounding in goodness is the gift of 
life.

The Power of Generation is the 
greatest blessing, the greatest pleasure 
He could bestow upon the living Creation 
it exists in common with all, it 
levels all and it shows that the God 
of All is as Merciful and as thoughtful 
for the lowest of His creatures as the 
Highest.

Are any Substances which now are part of or in this 
Earth "Simple Substances" that is of one, Sole 
Kind of matter - for example, if we take a drop of 
water, by a stream of Electricity it is analyzed or 
divided into two Gases Hydrogen & Oxygen as its 
Elements. or by reversing the order subjecting certain 
portions of Hydn & Oxyn. to Electricity - water is produced 
may I ask if pure Native Gold can by any means 
be separated into its Elements as a Metallic [?] or 
a Metallic [?] a Metallic [?], have I made myself 
understood.

7173 1570 You have

Nothing exists in an [?] state 
everything is mixed and extracts 
from this Mixture, make mixtures of 
a very different kind

If Gold then is not Simple & homogeneous, cannot 
it be then divided into its Elements

7174 1571 It cannot be divided for where this 
possible [?] might be made of other
136 

other substances, for the substance 
which makes that could be found 
separate and w[h]ere that the case [?] 
might be easily made

The antient alchemists held that [?] might be [?] 
to its own [?]. [?]. & [Sophie?] [?] -. from which by certain 
processes. the [powder?] of projection could be obtained, which 
combined with other metals in a certain state transmuted 
that other & baser metal into Gold - Can any objection 
be offered at [a?] learned & pious Alchemist. trying to do 
this - to any [?] for good & beneficent purposes, [where] 
when the [?] uncultivated man. is allowed to 
delve for Gold & perhaps find several thousand 
pounds worth only [?] to be spent in [dissipation?]

7175 1572 There is no objection to the Trial, but 
it cannot be done

Pure Gold has never yet been made 
It is a natural production a Combinatn 
of minerals and nothing that man 
can do will make it - or an addition 
to what he has.

But man may obtain Gold, he may 
find out those places where it exists - 

Have Spirit & matter been equally Coexistent from 
all eternity, though as far as concerns this Earth 
kept separate from all eternity

7176 1573 They did not

because Spirit was Gods influence 
descending upon the Matter which had 
existed Eternally.

Were the planets which form our Solar System Revolve 
round our [?] as [?] created from that 
Chaos of Elements at the same time as the Earth was
137

or each from an Individual Chaos

7177 1574 They had existed eternally but at the 
time of Creation they were brought to 
Shine upon the Earth & fixed. before Creation 
they were all wandering planets.

When we see the order & beauty of their orbits & the Laws 
they obey & that even the Erratic Comets never come 
into Collision with them might we not suppose that if 
they were wandering planets they would come in Contact 
& destroy each other.

7178 1575 At the time of the Creation they had 
their places assigned to them, but before 
this they wandered about unfixed, there 
was no collision they were then uninhabd. 
merely bodies of [p???] vapor, when they 
did come in contact they passed through 
each other. the strongest passed through 
the weaker. and divided it, without 
either bursting it or discomposing it 
in the same manner that you might 
pass your finger quickly thro the 
candle without either injuring the 
flame or your finger.

Are you aware of the Contrary as to the Plurality of inhabited 
worlds.

7179 1576 Beings do exist in the different planets

Drunkenness as you are possibly aware is one of the 
greatest blots on Civilized life - & a Society has been 
formed, to introduce Total Abstinence from all 
intoxicating drinks, Beer, Spirits, or Wine. May I ask 
your view of the subject

7180 1577 Stimulants are necessary for man.
A moderate use of them is advisable


138
1577 7180
Water is for cleansing, wine exhilirating 
Altho in some cases, total abstinence 
from Spirituous liquors is advisable
I am no advocate for Teetotalism
Drunkeness is indeed a detestable
vice, it is more , it is a great sin, it
deadens every faculty that man
possesses, and makes him nothing more 
then a brute.
Jesus Christ made some at the 
marriage feast, He used some at the 
last supper. as the semblance of his
blood. and used by such authority
as this, it cannot of itself be harmful
to man. but it is well known that 
those who from habit have become a
confirmed drunkard cannot have it
off by degrees, and only use it 
moderately.  To those I say leave
it all off. and drink in penetence
the water[?] which is intended to 
wash out all stain.
[?] any further advice
7181  1578 Not this evening
May I ask you to request ES to appear
1579 7182 I will.
ES Crystal
1/4 to 10PM Called EC
He is here as before but so much yellower, his hands
are as yellow as gold.
May I again ask if I have your sanction to call 
you into this crystal, and to request you will tell me when
I am to cease doing so an I beg to [?] you I
139

Would not upon any account call you, against your wish

7183 I am willing to appear, I will leave when 
I desire to do so.

I have written this letter to your Son, do you approve of it

7184 Put earliest before convenience, he is 
very long about things.

Had you the psychograph at your house at [Chevering?] 
when you left this Earth

7185 Yes.

What is your opinion now of the [?] Theory 
or preexistence of Man as a thinking being

7186 I know that Adam was the first 
created Man.

What is your opinion of that passage. 1 John 1 v [7?]

7187 I believe that it shows his Mercy to 
those that believe in him. 
That it is a promise to those who 
recognized him as their Mediator 
And that it shows him to be the way 
the Truth and the life.

May I ask if you are now aware of that state of 
double existence of Mortals which in my letters to you 
I termed Atmospheric Spirits

7183 I think that it is the embodiment 
of the mortals Ideas, that those 
Ideas show him in his true state 
without disguise, and that makes the 
difference between the mortal & the 
Atmospheric Spirit

When you visited me at Croydon you once asked of the 
Spirit then in. the Crystal whether your Ancestor the 
first Earl S. died by poison or not, & you wished me 
also to ask the question may I ask if you have 
the means or power now of ascertaining that fact.
140

7189 I have not

As you have so recently left the Earth may I ask 
if you still retain the Knowledge of what happened 
to you when on this Earth

7190 I do of some things

Your Son is I believe a Sceptic in Spiritualism 
could you give me any proof by which if it was
requisite he could be convinced of your appearing in 
in this Crystal which you presented me with.

7191 I do not wish him to know that I 
appear here, he never respected me when 
living and I am sure he would not 
my opinions even when dead

May I ask your opinion of the manner or mode 
of your thus appearing in my Crystal & replying to 
my questions

7192 I appear thro the Crystal, not in it, 
it makes an opening in the Spirit World 
and by it I am arrested

May I ask if you know by whom this letter was 
written and its Contents

7193 I cannot see it

Have you recognized any of your departed friends 
since you left this Earth

7194 Very few of my friends have left the 
earth so recently as myself - many of 
them have gone on.

May I ask in what place state or sphere you are now 
in.

7195 Hades.

Have you then passed thro the atmosphere

7196 Yes

I have been visited by the C.A.
141

Is it permitted for me to ask the Purport of that Visit

7197 He set me on the right way of proceeding 
he gave me the Knowledge of things 
which before have been incomprehensible 
we conversed of many things, he told 
me about you, and I was satisfied 
of his great goodness

His love for you and interest is 
unlimited - he is indeed a lovely [and] 
ministering Angel

When you last visited us in the Crystal I promised to 
write to Dr Ashburner. but after you left the CA said 
I had better wait until you had appeared this Evg. 
may I ask if you have any further remarks you 
would wish me to make to him in reference to his 
Commcation with the Rapping Spirits

7198 Tell him that they are not allowed 
by [all] the Almighty, that mention is 
made against them in the Bible 
indeed there is a passage which seems 
to me now, clearly to be intended for 
this period

Tell him to consult that book 
to refer to those passages, which tell of 
the False prophets and the Evil doers 
and seriously to consider. what good has 
arisen from these manifestations or for 
what possible good end they could be 
devied.

How limited his ideas must be of 
the great and beautiful Spirit escaped 
from all Bondage, and bound by no 
[?] to earth. - Spiritual in every sense 
of the Term - without human Knowledge
142

7198  and without memory - to concieve that
this spirit after having many years
at liberty -- many years in happiness
[*?*] could so far [?] itself as to return to
them to remembrance -- and if remembrance
at all it must be unlimited, and they
must therefore remember the bad as well
as the good - to recognize their friends
to talk about earthly things, to tell
them that they are happy, and that they
hope to meet them, and far more than
this to make themselves known by
their mortal power of knocking, that 
is flinging themselves backwards and
forwards against material substances
and making sufficient noise for it
to be evident to those around that they
are present, and then to believe that
after having joined them as mortals &
conversed with them by means which
they themselves would have used, that
they could return straight to the
happiness that they had left.  and
throwing off this mortality begin again
the spiritual life.
     It seems to me now that a
mans feeling would rebel against this
Yet  I  when on earth firmly believed
it --
     How much grander & more 
congenial to ones feelings would it seem
to believe that the spirit rises from the
Body after death  to a new life,  that
gradually at first but rapidly afterwards
143
it ascends towards happiness, it expands
to Angelic Glory, that every feeling
Appertaining to Earth has left it, that
it is in communion with its own sphere
of Angels, and that at last it is
filled by its goodness and its purity
to stand face to face with its maker.

As Dr Ash [?] when he visited me at Croydon in
company with yourself  appeared to posses the
faculty of discerning spirits in the Crystal, may I
ask if it would be agreeable for you to appear in
my Crystal if he inspected it

7199   He will no look long enough

May I ask how long he should look on Sunday
if I called you.

7200  He must look half an hour and
then he could not see to read the first
time.

My letters to you when on earth were very lengthened
Have you any remembrance of them & particularly
the last one in reference to your becoming a working
medium

7201  I have and I thank you for it

May I ask if you have any further communication

7202   I can appear once more.

Will that be the last time.

7203   It will so that you can recognize me

Will you then appear next Tuesday 1 week if I call

7204 Yes

                   Invoked the C A.
May I &c

1580
7205  I will

I have written to Dr Ash[?], if he wishes to be present
when ES. appears for the last time - I presume there will be
no objection

1581
7206  Certainly there will not should he also
wish it I will appear,  here or at
his own house -

May I now request the fulfilment of your promise
to favor us with your view of the scope & doctrine of
the sacred scriptures

1582
7207  It must be observed by all those
who have given the scriptures their attention
that they are written in language
peculiar to themselves -- It is more
simple, more poetical, yet not so
explanatory as others written in the same
tongue at the same period.
     The New Testament was written
by men who without inspiration would
have been ignorant, at different times
and unknown to each other, until
their work came together.
     This in some measure accounts
for the inconsistencies which are found
in those writings when put together.
and besides this there are words which
have been altered in translation, some
of minor importance was lost before 

145

1582
7207   The Translation was attempted but 
the important parts are the same now
in the English version as they came 
from the hands of the apostles and 
emanated from the Lord. 
     As He intended it to teach Mankind 
to the end of the world so he would 
guide it safely in its course. -- there are 
inconsistencies in the Bible and there 
appears even in the New Testament 
passages in direct contradiction to 
each other, indeed it may be so perverted as 
to strengthen the arguments & meet the 
views of any sect of believers. 
     The most important part of the 
Bible is the New Testament - the old 
is more to be regarded as Sacred History 
and Prophecy of things to come, It 
treats of men, and is not written to men 
for the purpose of their Guidance - 
     In the first part of St Matthew
you find the miraculous Conception and 
birth of Jesus Christ and the same 
time his Heavenly Father resolving that 
some in a distant part of the earth 
should be made aware of his coming 
                direct guidance of the wise men 
of the East of the Star to Bethlehem 
with the offerings they thought acceptable 
to the Child - not only was his birth 
a miracle, but these men his chosen few 
were by a direct guidance from Heaven 
sent to him to offer homage at his 
coming.
John the Baptist
    "It appears from the context that John the Baptist was
a very popular preacher. "
      "This holy Apostle seemed to have put his hand / if 
I may so speak/  into the Bosom of those men and 
presented them with their own viscera, already glowing 
       with the heat of Hell."!

After teaching in his extreme youth 
men so much older than himself with 
so much wisdom he sends John his 
disciple forward to Baptize in the River 
Jordan - John Baptizes in all humility 
prophecies that he comes after him whose
shoe latchet he is unworthy to tie. 
Jesus Christ came to him in his 
humility and wishing strength for that 
great undertaking before him, he prays 
to his Heavenly Father that he will 
strengthen him with the Waters thro
 the hands of John, And here the 
3rd direct interposition of Providence
takes place for a cloud opens & the 
Angel of the Lord appears, and a
voice was heard from the Clouds saying
"This is my beloved Son in whom I am
well pleased."
Refreshed and Invigorated & Strengthened
by the assurance of his Father's love
the Son of Man goes on his weary
pilgrimage - that pilgrimage was 
indeed weary - he had the power of 
the Father without his knowledge, but
the power was limited to his Capacities
as a Man. he was allowed to feel acutely
every suffering that the flesh is heir to
every mental & bodily injury that can be
heaped on Man, and this at the same
time that he had the delicate sensibility
(?) feeling of angelic goodness of his
Father.
We cannot be surprised then
/a/ Matthew 26 39
O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me:
nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt
Prot. Version
147

1582
7202  When he felt these injuries so acutely 
in the Mount of Olives, that his heart 
should sink, that in the extreme agony 
of mental suffering,  sweat of blood 
should drop from his brow, that he 
should pray 
[*/a/*]   "O my Father if it be possible 
let this cup pass from me, but thy will 
not mine be done"
Again he was inspired with confidence 
The Almighty's arm was outstretched 
to support him, after returning to his 
Apostles, and finding they were heavy 
with sleep, he again prayed, that if 
it was the will of his Father to give 
him strength to execute it, he no longest 
desired that it should be left undone. 
     Comforted and assured after the 
3rd time of praying, he returns to his chosen 
friends, forgives them for sleeping, for 
he knows that the spirit is willing 
but the flesh is weak.   he takes leave 
of them,   for he tells them that the 
hour draws nigh
     He is betrayed, tried   Condemned 
and crucified, worse even than a murderer
he is healed by those men whose souls 
he came upon earth to save. -  they 
insulted , they spat upon him, they 
placed a Crown of thorns upon his lead 
and divided his raiment between them
they pierced his prone body with nails 
and hung him to the Cross and when he 
mastered the last mortal feeling that he

knew, they gave him vinegar mixed 
with gall in a sponge

     In the agonies of his death his
mortal feelings gave way, although his
spiritual feelings Ascended to his Father
and he cried in a loud voice, " My God
My God why hast thou forsaken me."

To show that He had not forsaken
him another miracle was presented.
The Nail of the Temple was rent in twain
darkness overspread the earth from the
6th to the 9th hour and at that moment
Jesus Christ gave up the Ghost.


This you find clearly related in
the New Testament,  it is repeated several
times, and I believe is sufficiently plain
to be understood by All, but the most 
important part of the life of the Savior
of man. I have not mentioned that
part which he gives to the multitude
in the Sermon on the Mount. I have Christian
duties and religious feelings which shall
reign triumphant from one end of the
world to the other before all things pass
away.
   In that Sermon Upon the Mount
is man's salvation opened to him, the
straight gate the narrow way is shown
which leads to everlasting life.
     There is a passage in that which
has not been clearly explained, this that
in which he says " Repent ye, the Kingdom
of Heaven is at hand". Now this would
"Repent ye for the kingdom of Heaven is at hand. 

It will be observed that these words recur in the 3rd Matthew -- 2nd Ver
and are used by John the Baptist =   They do not occur at all 
in the Sermon on the Mount as given by St Matthew.  -- but it
appears to have probably formed part of that sermon as it is
[cont.d] appears the Sermon took place on a mountain in Galilee
or near it = & St. Mark speaking of the same period in (1 Mar v 14)
     Jesus came into Galilee preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom of God
and saying "The time is fulfilled and the Kingdom of God
is at hand.  repent ye & believe the Gospel",  and it is also
observable that Matthew (c 7 v 28-29) uses the same words in
reference to the Sermon on the Mount as Mark uses (1 v 22) in
reference to his discourse in the Synagogue. --
     (This is not so)
     Mark  C 1 v 15.  ( corresponds to Matthew 4 v. 17 )
were the words [?] as in the response spoken by Jesus
[*below*] X  "Repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand --" but,
still the words may have formed the opening of his discourse
as St Matthew says  From that time Jesus began to preach
& to say  Repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand --
implying that those words were frequently used =

Ask the C A: to explain.

X Matt. 4.17 "Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand"
                                              Protestant Version
                      "Do penance, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand"

                       Repent ye, for the kingdom of Heaven draweth near

Seem to imply that the end of the
world was at hand., but when he
exhorted them to repentance, he did
not use it in this sense — he meant that
After his death the Communion between his
Father and the Earth would be direct,
that his influence would be universally
felt in the hearts of the Good and he
therefore exhorted them to Repentance 
that the Spirit of his Father might
reign in their hearts and the Kingdom
of Heaven be opened to them thro' that
repentance.
He meant that the Kingdom
of Heaven was at hand because it would
be a direct communication with Earth.
This is a part that will allow
of great argument , and unbelievers can
so readily grasp it , not taking it as
it is intended for them , "Repent ye",
but taking it as a great inconsistency
and saying how can this be, When the
Kingdom of Heaven has not yet come
when so many generations have passed
Away, their opinion is strengthened
when they turn to the 24th Chapter of
St Matthew — in it are two remarkable
things they are both altered by Jesus
Christ and they are in direct contradiction
to Each other.—
In the beginning of that Chapter
his disciples ask him how they shall
know when the end of the world is
at hand. but he then tells them that
Matthew 24 v 3.
The disciples who were Jews had the grandest notion of their Temple
thought calmly that nothing could survive such a glorious piece of 
work and therefore they joined the end of the world to their enquiry
after that went. But Christ never meant to extend his prophecy so 
far for he plainly says verse 34 This generation should not pass
till all things be fulfilled, so that the whole of this awful
description relates to the dreadful destruction of Judea by the Romans

Revd B??kes Lomment

1582 
7207 tThey are not to trouble themselves about it
for the end is not yet near, he then goes
on to describe to them that it will be
known to all men -- that before that 
time Nation shall war against Nation
Earthquakes shall be felt, famine &
[*✔️*] pestilence shall pervade the Land, that
the true religion should be in the heart
of repentant mankind, that false prophets
shall arise calling themselves Christ.
     He then tells them that no one 
principal sign shall be given, the sign
shall be universally known & felt, that
it shall be connected with the Atmosphere
with the aspect of the Heavens and with
the sight -- the sun shall go down
in darkness, and the moon shall not 
shed her light over the Earth, Thunder
shall rend the skies and no stars shall
be visible.
     Then the Light emanating from
[*✔️*] the Throne of Grace shall illumine the
world and then shall come forth an
Angel sounding a trumpet & declaring 
the End
     After describing thus minutely
those things which shall take place
before the end of the world "This Generation
shall not pass away before these things 
come to pass. -- You have this repeated
in Mark in Luke and in John.   a
     Here he did not mean by this 
Generation only those present with him
for there was a multitude of all ages
151

7207 1582    from the babe to the oldest 
     He meant the whole generation of 
Man from Adam the first man to the
last, because after this world has passed
away and all its inhabitants, dead &
living taken from it a change will take 
place in the twinkling of an Eye and
the creatures will inhabit the Earth.
not the Earth as it is now. but the void
from which the Earth was created
     When he said this Generation
he used it as a figurative term, he meant
Man Kind shall not have passed away
before these things should come, that 
they should be visible to those who were
on the Earth at the time. _

I ret Thanks

7208 1583  If it is Convenient to you I will resume
it next Tuesday Evening I have much
more than I could say Now.

As E S. promised to appear for the last time on that
Eveng. Can Emma  see him & receive your Comm'n
without hurting her Eyes

7209 1584  You can.

May I ask &c

7210 1585  I had intended before Mr Owen's meeting
takes place in May to make a
Communication to him trying to alter his
opinions on some things that he may
proclaim them at that meeting.
     I wish you to write to him and
when you have received an answer
152

7210  I will then address him.  I feel it a 
duty and should he wish to publish
any Communication he has my consent
     I make the Communication to him
in this manner,  that it may be directly
between myself and him, feeling that
you may not probably like to be my
Communicant in the way you have
hitherto been, so that were he to publish
it - your name would be unnecessary
because it would not be mixed with
any of your opinions or questions
     I wish to know your view now of this

I have entirely placed myself in respect of Spiritualism
under your guidance & do so in this -- I am sure that
all who know Robert Owen personally earnestly desire
he may even in the Eleventh hour  be guided to the
one path [?] that of truth.  Knowing that
once convinced he has the moral Courage to publicly
avow it, however opposed to his previous belief - I
will therefore write to him with this communication

1586
7211  I await his reply.
Any question that may suggest
itself whilst I am proceeding I wish
to be at once put.

I ret'd thanks & explained that as my Seers eyes pained
her I w.d not ask any further questions that Evening

1584
7212  Accept my blessing and sincere
wishes for your health

[Mars sign]die 3rd April 1855 - C A Mirror
Invoked the G S.
The C A is here etc.
May I [?]

1588
7213  Yes I wish to hear your remarks
on that before I again begin

Can you inform me, the reason of my friend Mrs.
Charlotte Lea's vision being at time so uncertain
& imperfect - last [?]die the responses appeared in
such small characters that she could not read
them.

1589
7214  I think that if your friend were 
to call them with a stronger reliance
and a firmer will, they would be 
plainer - and behave whilst they 
do appear in a calmer & less irritable
way - neither should they disagree
about it.
Neither does it do [you] for
you and him to be about it at the
same time, it must be done alone
by one without those oppositions
and disagreements which make it
almost distressing.

I have written to Robert Owen with the
commucation you made in reference to him

1590
7215  I shall make my special comm'n
to him next Tuesday Evening if he
replies before that time.

It was my intention not to make any remarks
in reference to your kind response until you
had completed your Scriptural Views but as
you now request me to do so, may I observe
154
with deference that the words "Repent ye for
the Kingdom of heaven is at hand." do not occur
in the Sermon on the Mount. but in the preceding 
chapter  Matt. 4 v

1591
7216 Those words did occur in the Sermon
on the Mount but were not repeated
in the relation of it, there is [?]
sufficient proof that they were
uttered by Jesus Christ, and that he
uttered them more than once for the
words in that chapter immediately
preceding were
   "From this time Jesus began
to preach.  "Repent [ye] for the Kingdom
of Heaven is at hand."
   You have this repeated by John
and believing as you all must that
John preached from inspirat'n, it is
but a repetition from the Almighty
of the words of his Son.
   I should have said this at the
time and must endeavor in future to 
make my meaning more distinct.

In your former response you also mentioned that
Christ's explanation as to the end of the world &
the preceding signs were repeated in "Mark Luke 
and John" may I observe that it is not at all
alluded to in John, I only mention this [?]
in compliance with your wish to hear [?] [?]
as of course I do not suppose that any created
being can be infallible, that being [?] [?]
only of the Creator.

1592
7217  In the allusion which is made in
155

1592 
7217  Saint Matthew by Jesus Christ to 
those signs which shall take place
before the end of the world  He makes it
Known that one religion shall prevail
and this is the end of all things.
     A full description is given there of
every thing that shall take place.  it
is repeated in Mark and Luke &
alluded to in John by Jesus Christ
himself in the 4th Chapter 21 & 23 Verse
     But in the English version there
is a few words wrong, they were made
as a note before it was translated by
one who read it
     Jesus christ in holding that 
conversation with the woman of [?]
says "the hour cometh when all shall
worship in spirit and in truth,
"true worshippers" were the words added
and this is the direct allusion to the
end of the world and its being at hand

May I observe that I do not perceive the parrallellism
of those passages -

1593
7218  It is mentioned in Matthew that one
of the Signs shall be the universal
truth pervading the Earth. and this
is what is again alluded to in John

May I request the Continuation of Your remarks
upon the Scopet Doctrine of the Sacred Scriptures

1594
7219  I should wish you first to see
that those passages do correspond
     I will make a few remarks
this Evening before Lord Stanhope
appears.


156

 RP.
1594
7219  The Bible is the great tome from which
all religion sprang in civilized countries
I mean religion which has for its basis
truth. -- More Religions are various and
they all differ, and passing carefully
thro' all those religions, their doctrines &
their practice, I cannot find one
which may be truly called That Church
of which Jesus Christ is the corner
stone.
     Therefore that Simple & holy religion
has yet to be founded or the trinitarian
doctrines cleansed & purified before the
Almighty can be worshipped in Spirit
and in truth by all men.
     When         are gathered tog'r
to worship God, he tells them that
he is among them, and it must be with
humble & penitent hearts that they meet.
he requires no form or custom. he does
not require that one man shall be
above the rest.  and pronounce in his
name the absolution & remission of
sins.
     He requires that all shall humble
themselves before his throne of grace
and each pray for his own Sins
     Jesus Christ tells his followers
when they pray they are not to use
many words for that the Almighty
understands their Wants. but to use
that simple & beautiful prayer which
he gave to them. and for more
157

7219 1594  Acceptable in the sight of that All merciful
Judge. "Father have mercy on me
a sinner". from the depth of an
overflowing heart than those elaborately
worded and refined supplications
which are made use of by too many.
     The Simple words of our Lords
prayer must come home to a man
in every distress, or trial, or supplication
or thanksgiving which he may wish
to make known.
     All Men are born into sin
and the very best are not wholly free
from it. therefore how forcible & how
expressive is that part, "lead us not
into temptation, for man of his own
strength cannot pass through that
ordeal.
     The Church of England is right
in its main points. - The belief in the
Divinity of Christ. and his being one
with the Father & the Holy Ghost
is the grand foundation of religion &
yet amongst them may be found, I
mean the Trinitarians as great or a 
greater number of Evil doers, Hypocrites
Ungenerous, unfeeling inhuman
Men, than in any other so called
religion, what a Mass of hypocrisy
may be found in those sitting in
High places, and Even in those who
call themselves the ministers of Christ
              St Paul in his letter to
Timothy gives you the Christian Character
158

1594 
7219  of a man who should be a Bishop or
a Deacon. - That does not corespond
with the priesthood or Roman Catholic
Countries, nor does it with the Character
of men belonging to the English Church
     The Roman Catholics are more
sincere believers in their religion, however
wrong that religion may be to them it
appears right,   they practice what
they profess and would go thro persect'n
& death itself in their zeal for their faith.
     Although their Idolatry for
Images & their worshipping the form
of Saints is very wrong it originates in
a good desire for they believe themselves
too sinful for their prayers to ascend
to the almighty and they therefore
make the Virgin Mary instead of her
son the inter-mediator.
     I think this a beautiful trait
in their religion and in their belief in
the Almighty's mercy, for although
Jesus Christ is the only one as high as
Himself and the only one who can be
both him in his Glory inseparable &
united.
     It is wrong to believe that after
the father had inspired her, had made
her the mother of his son. and he chose
her from among many, that he would
after that son had filled his destiny
after he had died to save a world
for which he was sent, and ascended
159

1594
7219  to his glory, that she the humble   
instrument of this great good should
be no longer taken especial [?] of 
and that after death her soul should
be but as those of other of her Kind
She is a Saint, an angel in the 
presence of her Son, and why not make
her the receptacle of those wishes and
desires to be transferred and made
acceptable through her to him -
                           
The spirit of L               S.          will
appear. - he will  himself answer
your questions

20' to 11 PM.  ES. Crystal
                  Called E.S.
3' now its thick, he's coming he's plainer now.
Welcome &c

7220 [1595]  I will answer them

I have rec.d a letter from your Son. he states he has
not found any of my letters - may I ask if you
destroyed them

7221 [1596] I did not, it is scarcely likely that 
I should as I prized them so much

May I ask if you remember where you placed them
                 
7222 [1597] In a cabinet with my crystal in the 
Library at Chevening

I ment'd my visit to Dr A. -  that he had then informed 
me he had also changed his [?] belief & intended
to avow it - publicly I asked if ES. had any
fur'r communication

7223 [1598] If he is Confirmed in his faith. I
160
I have nothing more to add.
As to Sir ESB

[1599] 
7224   if you do see him, tell him of my
appearance here and that I died
in the Knowledge and belief of a 
Savior, it will gratify him I am
sure.

Dr A read to me as he had been instructed to do
by a spirit, the notes he had written that morning
& also his note on Light to Riechenbachs work.
what is now your opinion as to spirits who thus
write by mediums — is it possible that Dr A's
spirit is a good spirit

[1600]
7225  he may not be evil.

The passage of the Soul from the Body at death
to Life Everlasting is to us so inscrutable may I 
ask an explanation

[1601]
7226   As thought leaves the Mind suppos'g
it to be immediately embodied.

Is death oppressive or painful or is only the
body that suffers — while the soul is insensible of it

[1602] 
7227  It is the numbness of the body and
the stoppage of the breath that causes
pain, the Spirit has no human feeling

You mentioned that this is the last time of your 
appearing in a form that we can recognize  is that
so.

[1603]
7228   it is

May I ask what form you will assume then

[1604]
7229  The spiritual form

May I ask how it is that we see you in your
mortal garments, the same so when you visited
us — the Ghost as it were of your cloathing --

 [1605] 
7230  When called I wish to be recognized
161

it is but an Appearance

As the lengthened Correspondence which took place
between us in your mortal life — gives rise to so
many curious questions & responses which yet left
much to be sought — may I ask if you can give
me any beneficial information on a spiritual
point of view

[1606]  7231  I am but a novice Yet, I do not
even know who sent me these papers
from America which are bound in
this book.

I will request Dr A to write to your Son for my
letters if you think that advisable

[1607]  7232   I doubt if they will be found there
now, his Lordship has an enquiring
mind.

Most surely your son would not deny that he
had found letters addressed to a parent so recently
deceased if he had done so

[1608] 7233  No answer

By what means are you aware of my Calling
and wishing to see you.

[1609]  7234  The will finds its way into the
Spirit world and arrests me.

By what means do you thus show or cause
to appear to us in this Crystal the painted
letters which form Your Answers.

[1610]  7265  Your questions awaken me feelings
connected with it, these feelings
are clothed in language by another

do you mean by being clothed thus by another
that your ideas are put into words by the
Spirit of the Crystal

[1671]   7236   Yes.
162
By what means then can a spirit caller be assured
that the ideas so expressed are those of the exorcised

[1612]  7237 because that Spirit being good, dare
not give other than the answer dictated
by the person who appears.

About 2 years ago a lady in black who called herself
Lady           unexpectedly appeared & made a certain
Communication to us was that assertion true.

7238   [1613]   No answer.

have you since we saw you thrown off your belief
that the prayers of the living are of benefit to the Dead

7239  [1614]   did I not answer you this question
when I was here before.

Yes but my question is do you still believe that

7240  [1615]   I believe so still

Can you give me any grounds for such a belief 

7241  [1616]   I cannot   it may be from a long 
cherished feeling which I have had 
and a wish which rises in a persons
heart when on Earth & expresses itself in
words -- --- --- --

[symbol] 10th April 1853 CA Mirror
Invoked the C.A.
May I &c.
7243 1495 I will begin with my communication
to Mr Owen
I then as usual prepared to take the response into my
minute book when the CA said
7244 1596 I would rather that you sent the first 
copy to him--
I then took some writing paper &  recd. the Commn. of
which the following is a transcript.

My dear Mr. Owen
7245 1597 It may seem strange that I should
choose this means of communicating with you. I
have done so that it may be a more direct address
to yourself than any I have hitherto made knowing 
that you will receive it in the spirit it is given of 
sincere good will.
 I have always taken great interest
in your life and feel the deepest anxiety to see
its object fulfilled and the human race uni-
ted in one permanently happy and enlightened 
family -- but can man succeed unaided in 
this object, can he surmount the whole array
of obstacles that rise in his way, can he humble
the high, and elevate the poor and lowly, can
he make those holding authority in the State
insensible to their individual interests and
ambition in their zeal for humanity, can he 
find the find the means of educating those 
innumerable thousands who are so ignorant 
of all light or more than this can he extinguish
that great evil which has existed from the worlds
1597     7245   164
beginning, the enemy of all good.    Man cannot
do this unless aided by God. His Almighty power
must uproot the evil before man can sow the good
seed and to secure His countenance, His guidance
and mighty help, man must do that which
is acceptable and finds favor in his sight,
and how he do this otherwise than by believing
in that new Testament which He has sent
man as a guide to salvation, that book which
under His protection for eighteen hundred years 
has preserved its undying enterist and which
has struggled through warfare and revolution
and tyrannical despotism in the Church
and State only to become after the lapse of that
time the bright foundation of the religion
     The belief in one God has two foundations
the one is the Bible, the other is nature, if man
receives any part of that Bible with Faith he must
receive the whole, and he must therefore believe
in the Three persons and one God, and in the
death of Jesus Christ for the redemption of the
world. If he makes nature the foundation of
his belief in God then the necessity of a Saviour
must be obvious to all who will consider things
from the beginning of Creation.
     When the first man, who was created
to enjoy perfect happiness upon earth, fell from
immortal estate, the wrath of the Almighty was
just in condemning him to death., but He knew
that those generations that would follow Adam altho
inheritors of, could not be punished or answerable
for his sin, but when generation succeeded generation
he found that the evil was growing, that
Matthew 1 v 23
"And they shall call his name Immanuel , which being
interpreted is, God with us."
1597        7245             165
they sinned more and repented less, and that were
He to punish them according to their deserts there
would be no hereafter, he then showed His great
mercy to the Human race, and He made that
very sin and the death that followed it the
portal of an everlasting life. He now determined
that the seeds of the true faith should be sown,
that man should have a convincing proof of his
goodness and mercy, and that the doors of Salvation
should be opened, that all those believing should
enter. for this purpose was God made man, who
more fitting to redeem the world and effect this
purpose than part of His own spirit born into
the Flesh and named by Him His son Emmanuel
interpreted by man, "God with us."
     The great scheme of Redemption
being now fulfilled and the son united to the Father
they exerted their mighty influence over all mankind
and this is the Holy Ghost. Those seeking the influence
of the Holy Spirit must ask it in humility of the
united Three, and he will be successful.
     Could you sincerely believe in the
Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, and the Son
as the Redeemer of the world, the guidance of the
Almighty would be extended to you, for how acceptable
unto Him would be the homage of one who in all
other respects is so truly a Christian Man.
     I trust that you will give your
attention to the life of Jesus Christ as written by 
his Apostles, and I think you must see the great
blessing of Faith in his divinity, and of those
things relating to him which appear to man
inexplicable, I will only say Blessed are those
1597   7245    166
who walk by faith and not by sight. I will no longer
dwell upon this subject, but believe me it is of
vital importance to your soul's welfare, and to the
body and soul of those who shall follow in your foot
steps. for could you unite your belief in the Trinity
in your supplication on high for help with the
noble you have formed for mans happy condition
on earth, that system and the true Religion
would flow together and spread universally,
as the true vine covering the earth whose branches
would be found in every heart, and the Millennium
would commence.
     Consider how deeply you are involved,
that you are responsible, not only for your own
soul but for many of those who almost worship you,
whose opinions are theirs, consider also the greatness
of your glory if being truly convinced you shall
wait with your followers who have been saved
even in the eleventh hour, the coming of the
Judgment day and receive with them your
rewards.
     In conclusion I will call your
attention to one other subject of scarcely less
importance than the former. the necessity
of abstaining from all intercourse with evil
Spirits while you are searching after good, when
you have attained but the first stage of conviction
the admonition will be unnecessary. I
assure you that those Spiritual Communications
with man, by force, which have created such
a disturbance in America and England are
undoubtedly and undeniably Evil, and it is
the last struggle of the Fallen Angel for the
167
1597 7245
empire over man before the commencement of the
rising of peace,
 with the most earnest prayer that
Angel can offer up for man I now bid you fare
well, sincerely trusting that He who gave the 
living waters of Eternal life unto the woman
of Samaria in return for the water which
quenched only his thirst will give you the
same reward for those works of charity in which
you have been so faithful a follower of himself
as man.
 Believe me your sincere friend
CA.

I retd. thanks & said I would forward it the next day 
to Mr. Owen.
7246 1578 I thank you
you will keep a copy of it.

It is now 22 years today that I have been acquainted
with my friend H Lea. I have a very great wish to
enable him & his wife to succeed with his mirror
& crystal but when last calling for him -- the
responses appeared so small that his wife could
not read them. May I request your advice.
7247 1599 I will call Lero to appear to you
I am still of opinion that it in a 
great measure depends upon themselves
When may I ask am I be favored with the Cont.n
of your views of [?] Doctrine
7248 1600 I will conclude it next Tuesday
I can appear next Friday if you
wish the questions answered from
Doctor Travis
If I am called I will appear there
168

1/4 to 10.     CA Mirror
         Invoked Lero.
Lero is here in black robe, dark hair, little whiskers
No wings. I can see his feet, both hands in
front of his band

Will you show &c

7249    11     I do not wish it

What is your name

7250   Lero.

Why will you not show me &c.

7251  I am not so high as I was

May I ask without offense the cause &c

7252   I have inclined too much towards earth 
& men.

I explained at length my desire to serve Mr Lea. to
whom he has attached - & the difficulty I experienced
when calling.

7253  I have appeared every time and answ'd
their questions  his wife is not a good
Seer.

Could you give me a seal similar to this to assist
her Spiritual Vision

7254 I have no Seal

Can you give me any advice upon the Subject

7255  Try as you will she will never be able
to see well.

As to Mrs Lea's Nieces 

7256  I cannot tell, he must try them.

Lero left Suddenly at 10 PM.
169

Present Mrs Purvis    C. A Mirror
♀︎die           Invoked the C A.
May I ask if we can see the atmospheric Spirits of
Mrs. P.'s friends this Evening

7257 1601 You can call them.

I have sent your Comm'n to Robert Owen., I regret to
find that in his Part C he has inserted some sad
Rhapsodies received from Friends who are the merest
Novices in Spiritualism - this has necessarily given
so ludicrous a turn to the whole subject, that I
do not wish any further Communication of mine
to be inserted - unless it is your wish otherwise

7258 1602 I had intended that my address
to him should conclude the 
published communications to him
from either yourself or me knowing
that every thing of Service to him
has now been done and that it is 
unnecessary to proceed further

Dr. Travis's [?] Question is
[?] Is not the term Free Will commonly
understood to mean - a power in man - which 
is independent of all causation, and which
is itself the Cause of all his volitions and
Voluntary Acts ?

7259 1603 
It arises from although it is not caused
by a strong healthy & vigorous
Mind.
     Man is answerable for the 
actions of that Free Will because 
they act in unison with his judgement 
his knowledge and his understanding
170

1604
7260  Yes that is where he is wrong 
The will being the Mind, that is the whole 
intelligent faculties concentrated for one
purpose. - because the will never exists or
is called into action unless circumstances
demand it. 

1605
7261 It is the will acting without [?] restraint
or Suggestion

Dr T's 7'h proposition is.
    "If this definition is correct - Are not all man's
voluntary acts produced by his Free Will as their
sole and independant cause?

1606
7262  They are

Dr T's 8'h proposition then is
     If this is so, are not these acts properly to be
considered as entirely mans own?

1607
7263  They are and arising from his superior
intelligence, and his moral Courage, he
is entirely answerable for the actions that 
arise from that free will.

May I ask why Angels as Yourself appear with
Wings - [and] it is an [question] objection which has often been
raised
141

1608 
7264  It is but a form  it is a pleasing one
and it shows the distinction between the
material & spiritual being
     It suggests the idea of unlimited
motion and the power of visiting even
as thought places far different & dist't
from each other.  almost at the same
time
     It also shows the Communication
of Earth with Heaven and the possibility
of a passage through air

May I ask of such spirits as Hunder [Low?] Abeer
Lero & others whom we have seen always without
wings have the power to appear if they chose
with wings if, if Wings are limited to a particular
order.

1609
7265   It is limited to Ministering Angels

At a former response you mentioned that Mr [?]
daughter would possess the gift of discerning Spirits
may I now ask at what time or age,  it will be
manifested

1610
7266  Shortly

May I ask if it will be most advisable to develop
that faculty or to allow it to be dormant., that is
 so far no regards her own spiritual & bodily welfare

1611
7267   They do not the least harm to the
Spiritual Body --
Taking solely a worldly view of
these things it is not desirable for
one individual to possess it.
     It does the body no harm as far as
health is concerned to any thing
connected with it, but it is calculated
to [inj?] the reputation of a person

172
because there are so many that disbelieve
it.
Mr & Mrs Haydon, the Spirit Medium, Miss Jay the
eloquent preacher in a State of Sleep and Mr [H?me]
a gifted Spiritual Medium are expected shortly
in England. have you any objection to my being
introduced to them

1612  7268  There is no objection to your meeting
them but I do not wish you to
[communicate] my your Spiritual
Communications with thens.

Dr. Ashburner, as I before mentioned is a writing
medium & read to me his notes written under Spiritual
Inspiration   may I ask if you have any knowledge
of the Spirits who dictated that portion of his notes
which referred to me.

1613  7269  Use the word influence instead of
Inspiration
     I can find out under whose
influence he writes & will do so.

I should be very glad to ascertain if Dr. Ashburner
is one of the few who have the moral Courage to avow
his altered opinions upon Spiritualism

May I ask if you are aware of the reason why I have
not rec'd any reply to my comm'n to the Harmonical
Society in Cincinnatti

1614  7270  Sufficient time has not elapsed yet

But I sent my letter on the           last.

1615  7271  You will not have a reply under
6 months from the date you sent it

As to the Spirit rapping Comm'ns in Robert Owens
part 6

1616   7272   Do so
173

Can we see Mr Anderson this Evening

7273 1617 You can

May I &c

7274 1618 I have not

9 PM. Oval Mirror

Called Mr [Anderson]. Susan Northfield

He Mr Anderson is here black frock coat, Lavender Waistcoat grey 
Trousers, black stripe black boots, trousers strapped down 
Good Evening Mr Anderson. I am glad to see you but why 
have you come when I called a Lady

7275  In Invitation of your politeness, I 
dont know if you treat your bodily 
friends as you do your Spiritual

Why do you give me such a rub, are you still in the 
Crimea - I presume not. by your dress

7276  If you can condescend to recollect 
I appeared in February last and 
said I should be home in a 
fortnight, you have not been polite 
enough to call me or even invite 
me to appear.

I explained - and S'd this reminds me to ask you if 
you can tell me any means of preventing the pain 
in the Eyes which my Seer now experiences when 
inspecting

7277  I knew a person once who used 
smoked glasses, I dont know 
whether it did them any good or 
not.

You promised when you next appeared. to favor 
me with your name, is it agreeable for you to 
do so now.

7278  I will do so if you will do something
174
for me in return,   its very easy

Mr A.'s looking at you and, laughing
If with propriety I will

7279 Tell my fortune by cards then

Ah but you can't shuffle them remember

7280 That difficulty is easily got over. 
Throw the pack up, let them fall 
Separately & I will have the turnups

Well as soon as I have finished my book I will 
do so, but how did you become aware of it.

7281 Now I am come home I use my 
Crystal again.

Are you aware of the System I have recently been taught

7282 I am aware of the System, but not 
that one I believe

Are you in England

7283 I am in Marseilles

We expect Louis Napoleon & the Empress over here 
on Monday, I should have thought you would 
be here.

7284  What for,  certainly not to see the Show 
nor to see a man that I dislike 
or a woman whose name is not ---
unknown to the Spanish Court.

Will you tell me your name

7285 You will wait till you tell me by the 
Cards

I hope you have got over Your wounds

7286 Oh yes thank you

Did you know a Lieut  Col'l Dickson in the Crimea

7287 Why

Because you appeared to my friend Mr. Lea. in the 
Crystal when I called him - do you know him

7288   Yes what an addition it would make
175

to 12" Cakes if a certain person could 
see well.
   If a Lady a friend of yours, not at the 
west end of the Town could see perfectly 
Spiritual Characters might be made 
for the 12" Cake

May I ask you the name of the ship you came home 
in.

7289   The one I told you I should come home in 
the Himayla

Can you appear on a Friday

7290 Yes

Can you assist me to get a Vision of Mrs P.'s friends

7291 No I cannot

he's going Good Evg.

7292 Good Evening

25' past 9.

                    Called Mrs. Susan Northfield 
                    No Vision
                    Called Mr John Manning
                    No Vision

♂︎die  17th  April 1855.    C. A Mirror
8 PM.                   Invoked the CA
Is it convenient for you to favor us with the cont'n 
of your view of the New Test't Doctrines

7293 1619 I cannot do so this Evening 
Next Tuesday week if it is conv't to 
[for] you.

Lero informed me when in the Mirror that he is 
not so high as he was - Is it possible for a Spirit 
to fall from a higher to a lower state
176

7294 1620   It is possible for those who have not 
risen high.

May I ask why we could not obtain a Vision of 
Mrs. P's friends on ♀︎die night - You said "I might 
call" -

7295 1621  I cannot always tell whether living 
Mortals will appear when called in 
any other mirror than the one I appear[ed] 
in myself.

I have received this letter from Robert Owen in reply 
to your Communication, I then read the letter and 
placed the Minutes against the Mirror -

7296 1622  I wish that it will be published, I leave 
the way entirely to him.
     I cannot but admire the strength 
with which he upholds his convictions 
although they are so wrong, but I 
earnestly trust - more, I feel firmly 
convinced that at the last, even be it 
when the hour draweth nigh. he will 
be as truly convinced of the right, 
from the Spirit above. As he is now 
of the wrong solely from his mind.

Is it your wish that this should be the last 
communication to Mr Owen.  (for printing)

7297 1623   It is, more would be unnecessary. 
I should be very much pleased if 
Mr Owen would mention it at his great 
meeting in May, so [far?], that 
those who hear him may Judge 
of the two means by which the 
permanent happy existence of the 
human race can be obtained, that is, 
Mans reliance upon himself, or upon God,
177

I think it would not interfere 
with his own plans, I ask that 
you could attend that meeting, tell 
him that I shall be there.

As my Seer has latterly [experienced] felt so much 
pain from inspecting may I ask if in order to relieve 
her eyes [from inspecting] develop my faculty of a 
writing medium under your Sole guidance

7298 1624  If you are made a writing medium 
I cannot prevent others as well as 
myself directing you, although I 
could be with you often you could not 
tell when I left.
     I have told you before that there 
are low grovelling Spirits upon the 
earth. who can only see that which 
is open unto the Eyes of Man, but 
they can read that which has been 
written by him, the moment I leave 
one of these may continue my 
communication, and without contradicting 
it pervert is so slyly that 
you could not at first notice it
      Of the means by which I now 
appear and this only can I be 
perfectly assured no harm will come 
and nothing but my own direct 
communications come. when my form 
is present or my name attached to it
     No Spirit of my Sphere or of 
any class can take my form and 
none dare take my name.
178

I explained at length my motives

7299 1625 I will appear by this means whenever 
you call me, and it is possible
     I am aware that my answers 
are at times more indistinct than 
at others - this Seal has effected 
much towards them being made 
plainer.

May I ask if you are aware that Spirits guide 
Dr Ashburner. as a writing Medium

7300 1626 I have not yet ascertained but I 
will do so

I again explained my reasons as to being a 
writing medium.

7301 1627 Be assured that I desire this 
Communication as much as yourself

As to my thoughts at night when directed to [him?]

7302 1628 No answer

When Our Lord was Crucified - did he repeat the 
whole of the 22nd Psalm or only that portioned 
mentioned by St Matthew

7303 1629 He only repeated the words I before 
mentioned to you

Matt. 27 verses 52 & 53
Are these verses correctly rendered

7304 1630 They are

May I ask the meaning of a passage which appears 
to me so inexplicable

7305 1631 It means the Spirits in the form of 
the bodies of those who had preached 
his Coming and who could not rest 
until their prophecy was fulfilled 
appeared to the eyes of those who 
disbelieved them
179

In reading the New Testament one cannot help 
regretting, that so small a portion comparatively of 
Jesus.' own words have been given

7306 1632  Sufficient has been given to prove his 
Divine mission and of his doctrine 
of Faith, why would you have more 
of the life of a Man who had many 
sorrows and whose flesh was frail

I did not mean, more of his life, but his Doctrines 
his own actual words - instead of the Epistles of his 
Apostles - have I made myself understood

7307 1633  You have 
but I still believe sufficient of his 
own words are given for the purposes 
intended

My reasons are, in part taken from John 21 . 25 
but I suppose Johns assertion is rather to be taken 
as an Oriental mode of Speaking

7308 1634  Yes indeed that is an addition of his  
own.

The C.A. left

9-25 Oral Mirror. 
         Called Mr Anderson 
         No Vision

♂︎die  April 24th  1855.  CA Mirror.
                 Invoked the C.A.
The CA is here, in morning

May I ask if you have ascertained the name of 
the Spirits who guide Dr. Ashburners hand as a
180

Writing Medium, & who referred me in his Communication 
to Dr A's note [?]                of his Translation of Riechenbach

7309 1635  Their names are 
ELEVE and OIMAR

May I ask the Spiritual Meaning of those names

7310 1636   No answer

Asked again

7311 1636 They have a meaning to Spirits

Of what Sphere or order are they

7312 1637 They are Wandering Spirits

If Dr A. exorcised them would they be compelled 
to answer to their names & acknowledge them.

7313 1638  They could Evade him.

By what means through your aid could I 
prove to Dr A. - or enable him to prove that they 
are wandering Spirits and not the Souls of dec'd. 
friends as he supposes - as Dr A is so candid 
an Enquirer, & from his learning & position enabled to 
be as others - is it not desirable that he should 
be placed in the one way. Truth -

7314 1639  It is desirable, but at the present 
time there is no means of convincing 
him, an opportunity will at a future 
time occur.
     his faith will be shaken in 
these spirits and when a doubt enters 
his mind, I will then offer my 
Suggestions -

Is it advisable that I should write him thereon 
or Wait

7315 1640  There is no objection to its being sent

A work has been lately published called under the 
Title of                                           It has been considered
181

by some as utterly demolishing Christian Doctrines. 
but I cannot perceive on what grounds, it contains 
little that has not already been many times asserted 
by other authoers.

7316 1641

May I ask which will be the best Method. the work 
consists of [blank] short Chapters

7317 1642

When will it be agreeable for me to Commence

7318 1643

Shall I.

7319 1644

May I ask some further questions in reference to 
the writings of Emmanuel Swedenborg.

7320 1645 A moment first 
The person who has appeared several 
times to you, and who is the Spirit of 
the late Joseph Balsamo, again Embodied 
desires most urgently to appear again 
this Evening - I second his Request - 
because I know that you can do good 
for him and that you will not refuse
page 44
182

him the aid you would so willingly 
extend to others, by directing him towards 
the bright and true faith of which you 
are such

I explained at length, and my objection to the last 
remark - I shall be glad to see him at 9 oclk.

7321 1646 He will appear at that time.

As I have before mentioned to you. & which doubtless you 
know far better than me - how highly Esteemed the 
[?] of Emmanuel Swedenborg are by a very numerous 
Sect in this Country as well as other parts of the 
World. - Yet as his assertions are so different from 
the Views you favor me with - I am anxious to know 
how so learned & truly pious a man could make 
the following Assertions. - believing them to be true. 

234    - H and H

Angels converse together like men in the world & talk 
like them on various subjects, such as their domestic 
affairs, the affairs of their society, and those of 
moral and spiritual life; nor is there any difference 
except that they convers more intelligently 
than men because from more inward thought, 
I have frequently been permitted to associate with 
them and to converse with them as a friend and 
sometimes as a stranger, and since my state 
then was similar to theirs, I felt exactly as if 
conversing with men on earth.

7322 1647 When the body slept or rather I should 
say, when his body was inanimate 
for the Trances which he fell into could 
not be called sleep, his Spirit mingled 
with the Spirits of the atmosphere, it
page 77
1647  moved amongst them as one of themselves
           and with them engaged in these [183]
7322  apparent conversations
           On the body and the spirit being
           again united the mind retained all
            the things that the spirit had heard
            and he believed them to proceed from
            those of a higher order.
235 Angelic speech consists of distinct words
like human speech, and is equally sonorous for
angels have a mouth a tongue and ears, like men
they have also an atmosphere in which the sound
of their speech is articulated, but it is a spiritual
atmosphere, adapted to the angels as spiritual
beings, angels also breathe in their atmosphere
and pronounce their words by means of their
breath, as men do in theirs.
Is that also true only as regards Atmospheric Spirits
1648       Atmospheric Spirits have all these
                qualities because are the reflection
7323        of men, and it is necessary for those of
                 a higher order who enter or pass the
                 limits of that atmosphere in which
                 they dwell to take the appearance of
                 what they really profess, because
                 were they to leave their sphere and
                 go into another different from their
                 own they would be incomprehensible
                 and as is necessary for them to be
                 Comprehensible beings - they must
                 take the appearance of those dwelling
                 in any place they visit it is not
                 until they enter their own circle
page 77
184
that they can appear really as they
exist.                                                

23/1  The universal heaven is of one language, and
all understand each other whether they belong
to near or distant societies, this language is
not taught here but is implanted in every one
for it flows from his very affection and thought,
hence the angels know the character of anyone
merely from his speech, for from its sound they
discern the quality of his affection, and from
the articulations of its sounds, or his words they
discern the quality of his mind. This has been
proved to me by much experience, I have heard
angels lay open the life of another merely from
his speech and have been told by them that
they know the whole of anothers life from a
few ideas of his thought, because they discover
from them his ruling love, in which are inscribed
all the particulars of his life in their
order, and mans book of life is nothing else.

1649  7324  In substituting Atmospheric Spirits
for angels  the first part of his proposition
is right.

As it is [near 9?]. may I ask to

7325  1650  I have not

Shall I call Joseph Balsamo in this Mirror
or the Oval Mirror

7326  1651  In the Oval one

The C A's gone.
185

The Oval Mirror

Called Joseph Balsamo.

[?]. He is here black frock coat. Black Trousers 
& black waistcoat.

Welcome &c. may I ask why you have so particularly 
asked to appear this Evening

7327 Since I last saw you I have been 
induced to believe that Good as well 
as Evil exists.

I am indeed glad to hear it, when I read your life 
as pubd. by the "Holy Apostolic Chamber." & reflect 
upon what you must have suffered at their hands 
I am not surprized at your former belief.

7328 I was tortured. and it was because 
the priesthood believed that I was 
able to divulge a secret that would 
bring them wealth by unholy means 
they envied me the possession of it 
even altho' they professed to believe 
that my souls salvation was the 
price at which I bought it -

Do you now believe in the power of transmuting 
base metals with [symbol] that is according to the Theory 
of the Old [Adepti?]

7329 It cannot be done

Persons may deceive themselves and 
others with the belief that it is Gold

Do you in your present state remember your 
friend the Count St Germaine a Courtier of Louis 14th.

7330 He is dead now

Have you any Conception how long he really lived 
upon Earth.

7331 I do not know when he died but 
when I lived as Joseph Balsamo
186

I believed that he had lived and departed 
from the earth several times in 150 Years

He is [posses] stated to have possessed the power of 
Removing flaws from Diamonds and also their bad 
color. this I presume he did by merely natural 
means.

7332 He never removed flaws from diamonds 
but he made Artificial ones.

As that is merely a Chemical. & natural process may 
I ask if you knew how he did so

7333 I do not now

You mentioned at a former visit that you had no 
remembrance of the Cabalistic Tables of [Rotalo?]. which 
you possessed & of which this is a Copy

7334 I cannot remember it.

Can you then tell me how it is that when I call 
you in the Green Crystal I gave my friend Henry Lea 
you appear to his wife, in the form you lived upon 
Earth., and enter into an Explanation of them & have 
Even promised that "we shall understand it" can 
you account for that duality of apparition

7335 No answer

Asked again

7336 I know not, it must be but an 
Appearance. for did I really exist in 
the same form as then, where could I 
be not in happiness for then I should 
have lost all earthly appearance - 
not upon Earth for that same appearance 
could not live there so many years 
not entirely Evil because after the 
lapse of that time I should be so 
much lower[?] than when on earth that 
the appearance would be too good.

187

I will not now ask any further questions upon 
that subject there is a far more important one may 
I ask if you have yet in your heart turned to the Giver of all Good 
for his Assistance

7337 I have only just began to believe in 
the existence of good as well as Evil, and 
the doubts that now exist are, does this 
good which I believe exists all over 
the Universe arise Spontaneously in the 
hearts of Men as the opponent of Evil 
or does it come solely from one cause 
the influence of one Superior & able 
to direct.

To enter upon the Metaphysical question of the origin 
of Good and Evil upon which so much has been 
written to so little purpose, is quite beyond my 
poor abilities - I can only repeat the words of 
J. C.. ask and it shall be given &c.

7338 Am I then to believe that one being is 
the author of all good, and then am 
I to supplicate that good. to enlighten 
me further - I could do this.

When you view your finite & limited powers, limited 
& powerless even when in the hands of your priestly 
tormentors. - how small a speck even upon the Earth 
we inhabit - Still less when compared to Millions of 
Solar Systems - what then must be your powers in 
reference to the Creator of all. - Call therefore upon 
him for assistance - You cannot expect his aid 
[put right?] & unsolicited - You yourself  
would let a man go a wrong road if 
you knew he was too proud or too idle to ask for 
information

7339 Not if I knew that may lead to
188

destruction I could always feel 
humanity in whatever shape I existed 

have you in your present State a New Testament

7340 I have but is it not written by the 
very priesthood who persecuted me.

Certainly not - You can even Separate the words of J.C. 
from those of immediate disciples - and his doctrines 
which teach "Love your Enemies, bless them that curse you" (Matt. 5.44) 
"Be ye therefore Merciful as your Father also is merciful" (Luke 6.36.) Ye 
cannot love God & Mammon (Matt 6.24) - Provide neither Gold nor Silver 
nor brass in your purses - doctrines which [enjoined?] [mineral?] 
[Anxiety?] [?] & humility [?] have been written by 
a Priesthood preeminent for their pride & avarice 
let me request you to Study it Carefully

7341 I have never read it attentively but I will 
do so - I will read it attentively before 
I appear again -

I am indeed gratified to hear you say so, because 
I deem it the only means by which your Spirit 
can have rest & your Soul ascend to him who gave it

7342 But it seems to me and I have ever 
believed that a Spirit exists without 
a Soul.

I will consider well what you have 
said, I will read what you have mentd. 
I know there are many very many 
who believe the same., & I will try 
& believe that all those cannot be wrong 
When I have done this I will appear 
again.

Do so and at a 1/4 past 11 I will.

May I ask you have any Comm you wish to make

7343 I have not -

I thank you for giving me this opportunity
189

You - If good should come from it 
I trust you will be rewarded with the 
Knowledge of having done a benevolent 
Act for a Suffering fellow creature.

190

May I now request the Continuance of your 
Views of Ch'n Doctrine

7350 1656 In concluding my remarks upon 
the Scriptures I would mention the 
inseparable unity that exists between 
Man & Spirit and how greatly it 
affects those Spirits by the Knowledge 
of the many Sects of religions and 
forms of doctrine that exist on the 
Earth.

Spirits powerful in their own 
state and high in their own Sphere 
are powerless over the opinions of 
men with one religion amongst them 
and that they know to be the true 
one, and the only way by which 
Eternal happiness is attainable, are 
greatly agitated & made Sorrowful 
by the Knowledge that many will 
not do that which would bring him 
nearer unto them.

In the Revelation of S. John 
the Divine in the 2nd and 3rd Chapters 
Angels are spoken of as governing 
Seven Churches that is Seven Religions 
and made accountable before God 
for the [errors?] of that Church of which 
he has given them the Guardianship 
and although he finds something 
to praise in each of those Churches 
none are wholly favorable in his 
sight. The last mentioned is found 
by him to be the best and to that

191

1656
7350  Church of which [?]. John is the 
Preacher and the guiding spirit 
he made those revelations which 
follow in that book -- Revelations 
much commented upon, but I believe 
little understood by man.
     On the many differences and 
the great commotion that has taken 
place amongst Spirits in the last 
few years I will not comment they 
have been carried by the various 
struggles, the Antagonistic Principles 
of the growing civilization & enlightenment 
of the World.   for what agitates the
one has influence over the other.
     The present bloodshed & warfare
is very painful to them, and casts
a gloom over their existence, and thus
angels pure as the creator can make
them are not without sorrow and
will not be until the day arrises
when all is spiritual as they. -

May I ask if this is the Conclusion of Your Response

1657
7351  It is

May we still ask our Questions taken from the 
Scriptures --

1658
7352   I will answer them

There is a question I much wish to have resolved --
     Are the priests of my Christian sect  by virtue, either
of their office -- their "Call"  their apostolic succession, the laying
on of hands -  or by any other means more sacred than the
general body of Christian believers - that is are they alone
Priests to offer sacrifice - or is each individual Christian
his own Priest --
1659 This response agrees with the view taken by Augustus Neander
in his Hist. of the Christian Church Book 3 Chapter 5. in which 
he strenuously asserts "the peculiar Nature of Christian Community 
- all Christians priests - equally related to Christ - and in a 
relation of fraternal equality to one another.
     "Since Christ satisfied once for all that religious want, from the 
sense of which a priesthoods has everywhere originated - since he satisfied 
the sense of the need of Mediation and reconciliation, so deeply seated 
in the Consciousness of the Separation [of] from God by sin, there was 
no longer room or necessity for any other Mediation - if in the 
Apostolic Epistles the Old Testament ideas of a priesthood, a priestly cultus
and sacrifices are applied to the New Economy, it is only with the [?] 
of showing, that since Christ has forever accomplished that which the 
priesthood and sacrifices in the Old Testament prefigured - all who now 
appropriate by faith what he Effected for mankind stand in the same 
relation with one another to God, without needing any other mediation 
that they are all by a Communion with Christ dedicated & consecrated to 
God, and are called to present their whole lives to God as an [acceptance?] 
Spiritual thank-offering, and thus their whole consecrated activity, 
a true Spiritual, priestly cultus - Christians forming a divine 
Kingdom of Priests - vol. 1 p 128  Bohn's Edit.
192

1659 With the Apostles and the Ministry 
of Christ, the prayers and the Sacrifices 
of one Man in the Eyes of the Almighty 
are the Same as another, that mans 
is the most acceptable that offers them 
the most sincerely

[?] Will the CA please to say "What is the Sinners ground 
of acceptance before God.

1660 Belief in the death of Jesus Christ 
and faith in his atonement.

[?] How can that faith be obtained can man do it himself 
or through the Medium of another.

1661 The Knowledge of that faith is obtainable 
through the Scriptures, the Holy Ghost 
is the Medium of his Faith.

" How then is the gift of the Holy Ghost to be obt'd.

1662 By humble prayer to God.

" By what means can the true meaning of the 
Holy Scriptures by truly and spiritually understood 

1663 By reading them with attention 
they are made plain

" My meaning is this man may read them Studiously 
and intellectually with great attention and after 
all not attain to a saving Knowledge of their 
Truth. so as to produce the New Life mentioned 
in Scripture

1664 Any man who would read them 
with humility and fervor would be 
endowed with a Knowledge of their 
Truth.

" The C.A will observe it is just the difference between 
one man and another but my point is how is he 
to obtain a Saving Knowledge of their Contents so 
as to obtain a Change of Life
193

1665  7353  The Holy Spirit emanating from God
is ever ready to open the hearts of
those who read with attention

[*FH.*]  But we are aware that many persons, worthy & pious
as Frail man can be, read the Bible with an Earnest
desire to attain the one true path. & yet irreconciliatly
differ theron.   thus the Unitarians, who for their
number are perhaps the most intellectual of [?]
notwithstanding their earnest investigations, have not
arrived at that which Your responses show to be the
Truth  but deny the Divinity of J. C & affirm the
Unity of the Godhead, yet there are doubtless very
many truly pious men among them

1666  7354  There are.
Their faith is as nearly right as
many of those who oppose them
there are many true believers amongst
them and many good men
     But the Religion has yet to
be instituted  founded solely in the
life and the words of Jesus Christ
from the New Testament.

But if the pious Unitarian searches the scriptures
with the hope of arriving at truth.  & yet so far diverges
does not that show that your kind responses
do not meet that point

1667  7355   It does not
No man can tell the heart of another
when he reads the book of Life
  Those who read it in humility with 
a desire to have its truths made known
to them  are not those who read it 
attentively as an intellectual employment
and to pervert it to the use of others.

"Try my [?] & my heart"
194
[*GJT*]  How is that desire to be first obtained, the desire
so to read as to be affected by its contents.

1668
7356  The disire of truth. The desire of 
Eternal happiness, rises in the 
heart of a good man. and one
who abstains as far as humanity
can do from all wickedness

[*?*]  In your response you refer to the "heart" of man 
as the part affected.  & effecting- do you do so
figuratively, physically or Spiritually.

1669
7357   The heart is the source from which
all spontaneous feelings arise, over
those feelings the brain of man
has no control. In the ignorant 
and the refined, "  the peasant and 
the prince, those feelings are the
same.

[*GJT*]  Are you aware that mans life is a continual
state of warfare in the struggle between good & Evil

1640
7358   I am indeed

[*"*]  And the more he reflects & the more desirous he is
to obtain good, the more temptations appear
to arrive to induce him to do Evil

1671
7359   It is so.
Evil the Antagonist of good Ever
strives to effect a victory over those
who seem above its power.

chain or does it arise from the defective state
of Christianity, or will it continue to the end of
his life

needed, and the higher he is raised by 
it, can he withstand the temptation 
of that evil

[?] When there is no perfection in this World, it is not 
intended that a Christian should be above temptation 
however high his [?] may be.

7361 1673 He cannot, with humanity there is 
[?] and with flesh frailty

" May I ask with all solemnity if the Holy Spirit is 
the only Communion between God and Man. in this 
World

7362 1674 No answer

" Does the CA object to answer that question

7363 1674 No answer

" Will the CA please to say if he declines to answer 
that question

7364 1675 I cannot answer it 
In the manner it is put I cannot 
understand the meaning

My meaning is whether the only Communication 
between God and Man is by the Holly Spirit, that 
is whether there is any Emanation from the other 
persons of the Godhead towards man

7365 1676 The Holy Spirit is an all pervading 
influence, it is invited into many 
bodies and they can make the prayers 
of man acceptable to God.

Will the CA explain the passage "no man can say 
that Jesus Christ is Lord except by the Holy Spirit

7366 1677 The Holy Ghost is the influence 
that makes those prayers rise from 
the hearts of man, and his Spirit 
pervades those who minister from 
Man to Christ.
196

In the questions thus put in a desire to  Truth
I hope it is by no means wrong to ask questions
of you on that Subject

Rev. 1. verses 1. 2 & 3 

In what manner did John receive this Revelation

7376 1487 It was his Spirit that received the Revelation 
while his body was entranced.

I believe those words were not written 
by him that open the first chapter

May I ask where Johns Rev'n begins

7377 1688 The Sixth (Sentance)

But the 6th Verse is only part of a Sentance - besides in the 
original the Book is not divided into Verses

7378 1689 The were originally written with marked 
Sentances although they were not numbered

Rev. 1. 10-to-16

If [?] the 7 Churches here mentioned were all of 
the Uniform belief being founded so immediately 
after the death of Jesus Christ

7379 1690 Seven Christian Religions

St Johns description of Jesus Christ was 
written after he had recovered from his 
Trance, and the description of him he 
saw was figurative

Likeing his face unto the Sun he 
would mean it was exceeding bright 
Purified and Light

And his Eyes unto fire that they 
were more light, more expressive than 
he had seen in man.

The seven stars were small bodies 
of Light in the same shape as himself 
and the Seven Candlesticks were 
but receptacles of those bodies of Light
198

7379 1690 which he calls starts, which represented 
the Churches

By the Seven Churches are meant the 
Seven Religions in which Christ is 
recognized.

I have mentioned this before 
I cannot stay any longer now.

of the Apocalypse next Tuesday

7380 1691 I will appear

I hope it will be well attended, there 
is no objection to any of your friends

I have humbled myself before Almighty

Having for so many, I may say 30 years - had so 
great an interest in your life, & which from what 
I have since learnt must have comprized many 
remarkable events, I should indeed be gratified 
by your giving me some idea of them.

7387 Do you mean my three lives

I explained

7388 I do not think I am able to do it - 
I cannot remember these things 
which took place in my first or 
second state entirely. 
I know the most important things 
I feel now all the horrors of the 
situations in which I have been 
placed - how I longed for a life 
better than the ones I have spent 
being now convinced that that life 
exists after death. I would not wish 
even in Spirit to return to Earth 
after I once quitted it forever.

I explained how gratified I should be to hear the 
Experience of one who had thrice lived upon
200

this Earth, altho so repugnant to our feelings &
opposed to our belief 

7389   It may be repugnant but it is
nevertheless true - I could let you
know my life other than this

I requested an explanation

7390   In another way from that you
have mentioned of repeating it
myself 

May I ask how you would do so.

7391  There are books & papers existing 
that I could place in the Mirror
written during each of my separate

In White, but not morning -- no mantle

May I &c

1695 
7393  Yes ____  I was present on Monday at
Mr. Owens meeting and  I noticed particularly
with regret one passage in his address
He said "That man can do no good to
God -- that adulation & praises are
flattery  to him, and that flattery was
contemptible to him  Coming from his
own creation - that the only way
201

7393 1694 Man had of Leaving his Creator and 
of doing that which is pleasing in his 
Sight was by benefitting his fellow men 
that this was the only means man had 
of finding favor with God - the 
Similarity of this passage to one in 
the book which you placed before me 
called "What is truth" seems to me 
exceedingly great - at the opening of 
that book only in the 3rd page you 
find nearly the same remark made by 
the author upon those of the Orthodox 
faith - Next Tuesday evening I shall 
have to dwell longer upon this Work 
further remark upon it now would 
be unnecessary.

I noticed the part I mentioned 
in Robert Owens address with regret 
because it is so opposed to Truth 
and opposed to every thing received 
by Man from God through the 
Scriptures and by other means

Flattery would indeed by contemptible 
to the Almighty, because flattery is only 
a coverring for other failings - there is 
ever something base, servile & hypocritical 
concealed beneath that hated mass 
Flattery. but the adulation & the 
praise of man when Sincere is not 
flattery and it is received as it is 
meant - It is necessary that that 
Creation should bow with reverence 
to Him who made it after His own 
Image, and it is also necessary for
"As God is infinite in his Nature it stands to reason that He can only
be seen in part by any finite being for this reason the Almighty
made himself visible on the form of an Angel frequently to the
Patriarchs but then they saw him with their internal or 
Spiritual sight; but no man says John has ever seen him in
his mortal sight.    Banks in Comm'tn  [?]

"These results have cost the lives of 54 English Agents out

among other Missionaries on the same Coast lead to very
serious questioning among us who lead.  Whether European

1695  mans Salvation that he should 
worship with Love and Faith. his 
maker and his saviour, This is 
the first object, after that truly may 
Robert Owen say, man should love 
his neighbour as himself.

Have I your permission to send your kind response to 
Mr. Owen -

1696   7394  You have if you intend writing to him 
there is something else I would mention
     Man should not Worship God 
as a finite being - too many create 
an Ideal of him in their imagination 
and worship that Ideal, but He 
should really be worshipped as the 
great incomprehensible being that 
no imagination can paint - do you 
understand me.

I explained my Views.

1697  7395  My remark was made because Mr. 
Owen believed that all men by 
Worshipping God which he calls flattery 
lower him to their own Standard. 
Man can and often does truly worship 
him as an incomprehensible being 
and yet that very worship so closely 
unites them that those truly 
worshipping him can imagine His 
Glory and Even the feeling with which 
he receives their Devotion.

I will, [Dr?], write to Robert Owen & earnestly do I 
hope he may be guided to the Truth. being well 
assured that if convinced of his Error he would 
publicly avow it - for Truth I believe to be with him 
paramount to every other Consideration
Extract from "Memoir of Richard Williams - Surgeon. - one of 
the missionaries who perished at Terra del Fuego"

I bless God that ever I was afflicted . not only do I 
date my conversion from my illness but I believe that 
this illness was designed for my conversion, it was a 
seizure more remarkable than any of which I remember 
to have heard or read, and apart from the inward work 
of the mind it prevented a series of extraordinary symtoms 
which seem to defy solution, myself a medical man and 
for many years accustomed to witness disease in every 
form I have been able to explain to some extent at least 
almost every case . but for the cause of my own illness 
and for the explanation of its strange symptoms my 
knowledge and means of judging fall far short, but 
whether mere natural causes occasion all the bodily 
sensations or not, scarcely signifies: the mental changes 
I am fully assured were altogether the work of God.
     At the very outset I should acknowledge that I had 
no previous believe in the truth of Christianity, I viewed 
it sometimes in one light sometimes in another, I 
regarded it for the most part as an absurdity, at its 
many votaries I wondered, and their understandings 
I looked down upon as strangely deluded, I could 
not comprehend how a God should die, nor even 
bring my mind to admit that an atonement was 
necessary, the works of infidels however I always read 
with dissatisfaction or disgust, and any scurrilous 
attack on the faith of others I should have been ready 
to oppose. but into the truth of the matter I never 
thought of inquiring: and as far as my perusal of 
it went: the bible was a mere lumber-book. Science 
literature and my profession were my whole delight 
but the truth or falsehood of christianity I felt it 
no part of my business to examine.

with which he was siezed & during a kind of catalyptic 
Trance. he altho. previously a sceptic & a Deist. received 
a very Strong religious Impulse or "Awakening" - in 
many things   it so much resembles the communication
made to me by the Spirit of the late ES. - that I
wished to ask your view of it -- the more so as it may
be objected,   If conversions can be thus wrought
why are not the great body of Unbelievers   but in
other respects   estimable men  placed in the True
Way.

of the Truth by a Miracle would
not have any merit of the belief

that conviction would bring

I knew myself to be a creature sprung from God, 
but I never dreamed that I was a creature accur[sed] 
before him. I knew God to be infinitely just, but 
I never feared that that justice would consign 
me to eternal misery. I knew that I oftimes acted 
contrary to my conscience; but I believed that 
intellectual enlightenment and the mere [for?]
of reasoning could carry human nature to perfect[ion]

I deified human nature as capable of transcend[ent] 
virtue,  and absolutely denied its innate corrupt[ion]

of the future.
     Such is a slight picture of my state of mind

My attention in  the enormous  [?] ruined in this
country for Foreign Missions -- & setting aside the numerous
cases of Religions Impostors who make missionary labors
a pretext for a life of Idleness. -  There are many truly
pious persons who enter body & soul into their mission
but I have never been able to believe, not withstanding
that most of the immediate disciples of Jesus met violent
deaths in their missions -- that in the 19th Century men
as in this Instance where Capt. Gardiner, Mr. Williams
Mr. Maidment and           others perished miserably of 
cold & hunger in their endeavor to plant the Gospel
among the savages of Fuego, can possibly be doing
that which is acceptable to God - or justifiable to their
families in thus risking their lives upon such ill
judged expeditions - but that it is rather the result
of a morbid Fanatacism -- Have I made myself
understood.

(See note opposite page 202)  
I do understand it.
Civilized men going from an
enlightened country to uncivilized
parts know not what a duty or
a danger they incur -- as individuals
their object is praise worthy, but they
do harm to those they would prosper
and the sacrifice of themselves is not
acceptable t the Almighty for the
good of their Fellowmen  so long as
those countries remain ignorant and
in darkness,  that ignorance to them
is bliss, because what sins they
incur are not intentional, and they
receive from their merciful Creator
the same happiness as those who
have knowingly sinned & repented
but when a gleam of light in the
waiting to see me and instantly I felt myself severely
unwell.  I went upstairs and threw myself on my
bed. in a few minuets I felt inexpressibly ill. The
first sensation was an amazing weight on the chest,
with difficulty of breathing, the carotids of my thr
striking like hammers on my head, and a feeling
as though torrents of air were rushing into my brain
and the head itself were expanding.  The agony
became insupportable and I knocked for some one 
to come to me, meanwhile my mind acquired a
wonderful vivacity.  Thought upon thought came 
pouring in with a distinctness of apprehension,
enlargement of view, and faithfulness of memory
such as I never before experienced. a power to
comprehend any personal identity and to understand
my relation to time and eternity was
wonderfully given me. the passing moment
seemed without beginning or end. I felt as though
immortal faculties, immortal relations were beginning
to be recognized.  The thought began to stagger [?]
that the hand of death was grasping the cords
of life, with the thought, darkness -- thick, palpable
darkness -- gathered on my soul. a mountain load
seemed to crush my breast, it was girt as with 
bands of iron.  my heart felt to big for its wonted 
space, a horror  of anguish filled my whole being.
Unnumbered sins began to spring up before my
astonished conscience and Death in his terror ran
up to my gaze, look where I would. there was
no hope, one wide, unbounded ocean of dismay
and terror, lashed with tempestuous howling
roared on every side and the thought of an
offended God pierced my soul with madness
and despair.

darkened spots, then do they know
what sin is,  and not sufficiently
convinced of the means of turning from
that sin, they sin more  and are
punished, they have the knowledge
of Salvation    but all of them have not
the means   of obtaining it, and if this
light is again taken away, it leaves
them darker than before.

    To those who would undertake the
 task of trying to correct them  I 
 would say.

     The Almighty created them with
the same love for them and the 
same desire to benefit them as he did
those who are enlightened, and he
himself will choose the means of bringing
them home to himself --
     Be satisfied that He will  not
punish those men for not believing in
Christ when they are ignorant that
he ever existed, and if He intends that
you shall be the means of correcting
them to Your Christianity  he will
send them to you, or open a path

     In this state I lay for hours, meanwhile my  
sister, alarmed by my knocking had come and 
found me speechless.  Others of my friends were 
sent for, then  medical attendance, recourse was 
had to remedial measures, but I still grew [weak as?]
the night passed , and the morning found me 
the same. A painfully vivid consciousness of everything 
going on around me added greatly to my distress.  The 
first glimmer of light that broke into my soul 
was when the name of Jesus was uttered.  with
the very thought if that name the hope of mercy
was allied, and like a drowning man I clung
to that hope.  In the agony on my soul I called
upon that name; and in the meanwhile finding
that one of God's servants had entered the room
I felt a new hope, as if the very presence of a 
man of God was a source of safety.  he bade me
loke to Jesus, with the very bidding I felt an
infinite joy in so doing.  faith in that holy
name rapidly gained the ascendant,  my darkness
was turned into light, and in a short
time I felt a sweet sense of the pardoning mercy
of God.  after this I grew better and better, and
all my symptoms remited till I felt nothing
except the langour resulting from the violence
of my previous sufferings.
     Towards the evening however, a relapse
took place with phenomena essentially different
beginning with the same contraction of the
chest as before  there followed titanic spasms

sometimes by a complete rigidity of the neck and

I explained
impression of a breath of air that the approach 
of any one evincing an intention to disturb me now 
throw one into convulsions; and suspecting tetanus 
or hydrophobia the three medical attendants inquired
whether I had been bitten by a dog, or had sustained 
any mechanical injury.  with short intermissions 
this state of things lasted for successive days till
my strength was nearly exhausted. towards the 
close of the fourth day, and during the succeeding 
night my eyes were upturned in their sockets.
I retained not the slightest power of voluntary 
breathing.  I was incapable of speech; and the 
attempt to swallow a drop water brought on 
spasms which thretened suffocation.
     During all this period I was possessed 
of perfect consciousness; nor had I any pain. 
the only painfull sensation was the impossibility 
of resisting the convulsive movements of my body 
and the fearful constriction of my che[a]st. 
at first I was, as it were a mere spectator and 
observer of the symptoms - thinking and even 
reasoning upon them and when abstracted 
from their consideration. I felt that I could 
calmly meditate on Gods mercies. I had no painful 
conflicts about my state, but a settled serenity 
a tranquillity for which I could scarcely account 
unless from the coviction that my salvation was 
sure. but during the last night of this stage 
I experienced wonderful evidence of a world to 
come. my friends were assembled at various 
distances around my bed. the curtains were 
drawn, and a candle yealded its obscure 
rays, I heard the sobbings of my relations. I 
knew they looked on my life as fast fleeting
1704  It may sometimes seem to you that  207
           I am in error - it has done so - but
7402  I assure you that I never speak of
           a thing until I am perfectly certain
           I never have any doubt and
           if I say I fear, or I believe, its only
           to soften the expression that would
           attend, I know,
I explained the circumstance alluded to.
1705  I can never feel offended
           I do not wish any blind reliance
7403  to be placed upon me, I never could
           recieve it with pleasure. When there
           is an objection let that objection be
           arged and if I can conquer that
           objection rationally and consistently
           with the other doctrines I 
           preached then I think  I can claim 
           Attention.

                Action Ended
I was myself convinced that I should not recover 
I had pictured my body, carried to the grave, and 
had marked in my minds eye all the attendant 
circumstances. mentally I had taken leave of ea[rth] 
and I lay in perfect peace, assured of my salvati[on] 
a dead silence now reigned around, and as I 
waited the moment of my final change, it was 
an intense and deeply absorbing thought that soon
started in expectation.  inwardly I exclaimed
I come Lord Jesus, relapsing into [?] I felt 
all but dismissed. it had the effect of so far 
arousing me that I got power to speak and 
surprise and anticipation. I took leave of them 
I told one to the watchful, and spoke to the others
until power of speech again forsook me. as I 
lay, I drew any hand to my heart to examine its 
beatings.  I felt they were small and weak, I was 
content, for I should soon be in another world. 
I was even anxious to die, for I feared lest livi[ng] 
again I might lose that what at now seemed so 
sure, then at [?] that a new order of feeling 
came over me. I had the most extraordinary 
sense of the bodily presence of the power of  
darkness standing by the side of my bed. not 
that I imagined I saw anything, but I 
felt as if I could put my hand on the ver[y] 
spot where he stood. and i shrank from tha[t] 
side with horror and loathing, but blessed 
be God!  on the opposite side stood equally 
revealed to any spiritual senses; the power 
of salvation, the very embodiment of love
and to this I turned as to a refuge, I shrank from 
the evil one and poured out my prayers to Christ 
whose protection was evident to me, thus I lay when 
all of a sudden the most brilliant light darted 
into the room, and filled me with with astonishment,
now I thought the time is surely at hand 
God is visibly making manifest his approach. 
quickley will the Angels of God be descending and 
I shall behold my redeemer by the vigor thus imparted 
I was enabled to sit up in my bed, and with a 
feeling like that which Lazarus might have experienced
conscious of a supernatural presence I 
called out to my friends "Did you not see a light" 
next minute The impression came over me that 
I was yet to live, and at the same time inspired 
with the certainty of knowing what I ought to take  
I told my assistant to bring me forty drops of the 
tinture of opium and twenty drops of the muriated
tinture of iron, and to reheat the doxe every twenty
minutes,  after taking the first doxe I concinued
sitting in bed feeling as though entranced, and
what is singular, my arms, when extended at an
early part of the evening had remained so, evincing
the cataleptic state. I took the second doxe and lay
down.  These doxes so large that my assistant
afterwards wondered what could have possessed
him to give them were the means of my recovery. 
after a miserable interval, during which the
body seemed to be sinking into curruption, and
the mind itself to have lost all power of joy or
sorrow, hope or fear, a profound sleep closed my
eyes, it lasted more than twelve hours, and
awaking as from a dream, there remained no
trace of my former state except extreme debility

"rapid progress in recovery." "

to those who read it, and it is so with the Bible -

[?] 411  1711  The same faith should not be given to the
Old as to the New Testament, [one]  The old Testam [is] was written by men
with all human weaknesses and with all those errors
that are inseparable from the mind of man.--  It
was but the prophecy and the forerunner of the great
event which redeemed mankind --

[?]412  1712  It is mentioned by the author of "What is 
Faith" that it is noticed by all who read the Old
Testament how often "this saith the Lord of Hosts" [*page 10*]
is applied to any passage that may seem suspicious
for its truth  -  But can we believe that these passages were [not] received direct
from God as [the[y] [would] writers would lead those who read them to
believe [?] either that they are copied from other parts - thus -  when The
Almighty in the early copy of [?] wuld [makes] make [a] communications to [one] man containing
many passages concerning different things, that book
[is] was written complete, and [the next] succeeding & scribes [prophet] picked out
those communications that best suits them, and without
absolutely altering them, [he] put[s] them to a different
purpose than what they were intended for --  there
are many now who would do the same thing --
did Henry of Exeter wish to enforce upon the minds
of his congregation that a subscription was necessary
for the relief of the Poor and the particular benefit
of himself he would not scruple to say, Thus saith the Lord "Blessed
are those who give for unto them shall it be given"
but it is very different in the New Testament,  that
is sufficiently clear and Truthful -- It is given
from the Almighty to man through his chosen
servants.  to be received by them, as the only [true]
basis upon which [any] the true religion can be formed.

[?]413   1713  The Author of that book [?], that
the antiquity of the scriptures does not add to its
3
value, but it does -- no book could be preserved
by its own merits with as much interest for "1800 years  [*page 2*]
as the [Bible] New Testament  -- travelled through the four quarters of
the Globe -- translated into every language, although
written by uneducated men -- when even the art of
writing was not prevalent -- it passes through
Rebellions & Revolutions of the Church & State -- it
stands out in the 19th Century with more believers 
in the religion of which it is the foundation than
any other existing Idol. -- God is not even 
worshipped through Nature as He is through that 
book -- and why  ?   because he has ordained that
those two shall agree -- His nature -- and His
Book -- one is incomplete without the other.

[?]414  1714   Man believing in God only through 
Nature as the author of "What is Faith" seems to do   [*17*]
must ever be in error -- he must even feel that there
is something wanting to complete the knowledge   [*p 49*]
he has gained by studying the works alone without
the Intelligence displayed by the Creator. -- In nature
he can have no knowledge beyond his sight, but turning
to the book which that creator has given him, to hold
communion with himself, he knows the origin of
that creation and the end for which it has been made [*50*]
it furnishes him with a hope beyond the Grave ---  [*pages 2
                                                                                           39 ・ 58*]
[?]415   1715  The author then Treats of the "Religious  [*65  64*]
obligation of belief" -- if man is merely obliged to
believe that which his reason revolts at  he wears only  [*[?]!*]
a mask of hypocrisy to deceive the world.  whatever
a man may believe  must be spontaneous,  pure
and to him True. --  believing other than this is not
to him belief -- a mans belief may be changed
because the errors of one belief, may be made apparent

4
to him, he may then be made to believe what is opposed
to it - or he may be trained - educated in one belief 
and that belief may be error -but until he is fully
convinced of it, it is to him True.

1716 
[?]416  It is a sad thing that my man on a 
subject so fraught with happiness or with danger as 
Religion should seen to be that which he is not 
because were they religionists at all,  they must know 
that unto god all hearts are open, and they cannot
hope for his mercy when they know that they are
disguising under a cloak of hypocrisy their real
feelings and their belief from their fellow men 
    Religious obligation [therefore] of belief therefore cannot
exist - He likens those who offer homage to Almighty
God as a supreme being formed according to their
won judgment as the highest and holiest being they  [*page 3*]
can conceive -- as "pots worshipping the Potter that   [*9*]
made them" and He who delights in the love and
faith of his children, as an operative potter delighting
in the worship of his own pots -- [?]  The accomplished
Author of "What is Truth" would do well to reserve his
Sarcastic comparisons for a more fitting occasion
in many places throughout his book he uses a
tone of levity ill becoming so serious a work - he
says that man the creature creates God after
his own image, he is wrong, man must worship
that which he can embody, even if spiritual if
must have form, and even although he cannot
comprehend the three persons in one God.  he still
believes that they exist -- so before he can have that
faith and trust that he reposes on his Creator.

1717
[?]417   The Author alludes to Jesus Christ as
quickening only whom he will and damning those  [*page. 5*]
1718  That God gave his Son to be the [?]pitration for our Sins
is a sufficient answer to the objection which represents the
Evangelical doctrine as dishonorable to the benevolent
character of GOD.  for this is the highest expression of that
benevolence that has Ever been recorded --
      "That He beheld more  He beheld the manifestation
of his won Love,  He beheld the working out of his own purpose
he beheld the harmonious acting of his own righteousness
as a ruler with his own compassion as a Father -- He
delighted in his Son who stooped so low; who presented
himself as a man; who did all that a man ought to do;
who bore in his own person the Chastisement of Sin which he
had not committed, that those who believe in him might
for his sake be entitled to the Eternal Life which they had
forfeited                                 Ec. Rev  p 705  dec 1851

he will not quicken - of calling many and choosing   [*page 5*]
few - but at the same time he does not remark 
that the means of being chosen, and of being quickened 
are opened unto all mankind. that it remains 
with themselves, whether they will be the chosen 
few, and few indeed are all those created in the eyes 
of the Almighty who are saved to eternal happiness - 
it is to those alone that Jesus refers who will not be 
saved, who will act in entire opposition to the laws 
which he has ordained, who will rush into crime 
and wickedness when they know how to avoid it 
that he threatens with that punishment - "Those 
who believe in me shall be saved," are words that 
cannot be misunderstood - Those who will not 
shall receive punishment is also as plain - For 
those who have not the means of believing in me 
for those who being Sinners are repentant. - do I 
die upon the Cross 
          This in Substance was the whole tenor 
of his life - [The Aut]

1718   The author of this book tells us that 
the idea of innocence being sacrificed for guilt     [*page 15*]
that the idea - the bare idea of a father suffering      [* "  16*] 
his own Son to die an ignominious death for beings,  [*p. 56*] 
so much lower than himself is revolting to all             [*page 16*] 
sense of Justice Truth and Divine goodness. - he 
is wrong - it was necessary - Christian Men can 
fully understand this - for the Almighty to descend 
upon the Earth in the form of Man, to understand 
the wants and the Necessities of those in life, to 
teach unto them that which would be comprehensible 
coming from a being the same as themselves, and 
not only to do this, but to found for future generations
6
a religion of Truth. -- that being done the aim of
that existence was complete, and he then offered
himself a living sacrifice - for the sins of those he
loved so well - while his spirit ascended to his father
to intercede for those below - he lays before him, his
knowledge if humanity and they being now one spirit
send an emanation from themselves over the world
- an all pervading influence  to be in the hearts of
 those who will faithfully receive it.

The C A is here in white, no black edging,
Is it agreeable for you to give me your further
opinions

1719
[?]419  I will give you the answer to the 2nd Chapter

I read the 2nd letter, may I ask if I have made myself
understood
Chapter 2

7420 1720 It seems to me a very weak doctrine of GR's 
that man should be created perfect - when he made [*page 4.*] 
that assertion he could not have duly considered - 
for w[h]ere man made perfect, there would be no sin 
no temptation, no need of an hereafter, no need even 
of death, for all being perfect upon earth, that 
earth would be a paradise - no - The perfection [*page 8*] 
of man is left to himself, - and to his fellow men. - 
God gives the materials, He sends that into the 
world which will grow if well exercised, well clothed 
and well fed, into a fully developed man - and in 
that casket he sends a Stone that polished can be 
made a Gem. - he gives him intelligence & reason 
but it must be brought forth by circumstances 
by training and by Education, were man left 
perfectly to himself, he would be unable to make 
even a sound intelligible to those around him 
how then can this man be perfect - the work does 
fall imperfect from the Almighty's hands, and 
the means are given unto man, by which he can 
make perfect that imperfect work -

7421 1721 Allowing this of all generations since 
the fall of Adam. - he could not have been created 
perfect - he was in the natural form perfect in 
intelligence - in reason - and in Knowledge but not 
perfect in good principles - In truth, or in faith - 
He sinned, and for that sin he was [?] with 
death - to enter a new life in a perfect state, a state 
purely spiritual - and in that state there can be no 
Sin - from the very cause of his being perfect - 
But - can man be perfect upon earth, perfect 
in Truth, and sincerity, and Justice & Mercy, perfect 
in faith, and in religion - it is a question of mighty
the part in parenthesis was given whilst I was looking
thro the Testament to find the passage






As the reading vanished before I could write it all down the
words underlined were  repeated at my request
21

importance - the answer given by many would 
be that he cannot - but I am sure that he can - 
not that he can pass through life so, that is 
impossible, but at the last before his death, when 
he is yet acting and moving among men - he may 
be perfect as a Spirit of righteousness - Jesus Christ 
himself tells man, that he may be so, after having 
shewn them the means of being truly righteous 
he, exhorts them saying - Be ye therefore perfect 
even as your Father which is in Heaven. (you will 
find this in the New Testament it is immediately after the 
Sermon on the Mount)

The Author of "What is Truth" speaks of 
that inherent sense of right in man which 
harmonizes with or revolts at those things received by 
his reason and understanding - He speaks of that 
instinct as mans endowment from Natures God - 
- Granted. that it is so - but it is only one of the 
many [that] he recieves, and it is the weakest of 
them all. - but are not his other qualities, his 
mind, his understanding, his reason, his intellect, 
his thought, his will, and his judgment, special 
endowments from Nature's Creator. and his God? 
then why should he resist the evidence recieved 
by these faculties, because the Animal instinct - 
that which is felt in Common by all creation 
rejects them.

7422 1722 It is said that Knowledge comes from 
the Brain - feeling from the heart - it is true - 
when that Knowledge fails, then may feeling guide 
man aright, but the evidence from the heart should 
not be recieved in favor of the Superior intelligence of 
the brain - the heart is the seat of softer emotions 
perhaps of power sentiments, nothing but truth
9

exists in the feelings, that it emits, but it often errs, 
therefore I should say believe in that which is 
made evident to the intelligence - not to the feelings -

7423 1723 If man knows that he must face 
death in a battle, his heart would shrink from 
it - would yearn towards other objects - peace 
Country, Home, it would be almost childish in its 
feelings - but still his reason would tell him that 
he must go forward, he would be called Coward, 
the world would upbraid him, and ever after he 
would live in misery - therefore he follows the 
dictates of his reason, goes on to the battle and is 
Killed - which is most right - which gains him 
the greatest reward.

7424 1724 There is another assertion I should wish 
to contradict - he treats faith beyond Knowledge 
with contempt. - If man believes only that 
which he sees, that which he knows & understands 
what a weak low unhappy creature he must be. 
- All men have faith in thing which they 
do not see, or [of] have evidence of. Man comparatively 
speaking understands nothing that he believes, and 
having faith in those things which occur every day 
beyond his Knowledge, why cannot he extend 
that faith beyond Knowledge, to the works of God? 
Many men do so & how much more elevated 
and exalted they are than those who will not believe 
in that, which cannot be made manifest to their 
Senses. - Men believe they have a soul, but they 
do not know it. they cannot see that soul, they 
cannot feel it - they have no evidence of is 
existance, other than a strong hope - a faith beyond 
the Grave - that that Soul is embodied in bliss -
10

and if he believes this, [for] that his Soul is immortal 
with nothing but hope for a base for that belief - 
why cannot he believe that of which there is 
evidence to show, why cannot he believe those 
doctrines of Christianity, in their finest form as 
preached from the New Testament? They lead to 
the same conclusion with his own hopes - the immortality 
and the reward of the Soul. - [I think it absurd 
to say the least of it]

7425 1725 I think it absurd to say the least of it 
for any man writing an English book to 
disfigure it with quotations from a foreign work if that 
book is written with the intention of being useful to the 
lowly as well as high to be generally circulated amongst 
all that are willing to receive it, it ought to be 
published at a low price written as plain as man 
can write it, in terms that cannot be misunderstood 
and it may be so and yet the language preserve Elegance 
and learning, and written throughout in one tongue & 
if it should be desired that another Nation should see it 
let it be translated, I admire good writing, to carry 
conviction with it and to have weight even with the 
uneducated it must be written fluently & grammatically 
but at the same time it should be easy & unostentatious 
no tone of Levity or of Sarcasm should creep out when 
the tenor of the book is intended to be serious give 
your opinion at once and decidedly without being 
tucked up and polished up so that it may appear 
that it really is not. after you have given your opin'ns 
then use your illustration for your argument but 
above all dont put in Quotations from foreign authors 
I believe there are plenty of English ones quite as fluent 
and quite as learned for any subject whatever

derision

I wish to go with my Seer to Mr Patterson's on Friday 
will you kindly permit us to have the Visions we wish

7430 1730 Yes

Will you on that Evening kindly appear in my oval 
mirror

7431 1731 I will

I will now proceed with the 3rd letter (read it
11
Chap. 3

1732
7432   I think with the author of what is 
Truth,  that Truth is the paramount object to which 
 all things should be subjected,  but I do not 
believe with him that there is only one way of 
arriving at this great religious Truth,  and that way 
through nature.

1733
7433   Nature is the servant of man  was created 
for his purposes, not for his director to his God.  
Man is between nature and his Maker, and all 
the smaller productions of God created in his use 
must be subservient to mans will - and although 
Nature gives evidence of a living and all powerful 
existence, it cannot satisfy man as to the nature 
of that existence - by looking at the universe the 
[str] moon the stars, the earth or even the grass 
for that is itself a miracle, he could not imagine 
the power that made them - he could not feel 
himself in unison both a being so great, and 
therefore nature is insufficient to connect man 
with God. - He knew this and He gives them 
sufficient evidence through the coming down of 
his spirit upon earth and furnishing the 
groundwork of Christianity -  of his power, & of his 
goodness--

1734
7434   It seems to me that life without a belief 
in Jesus Christ, and through him a knowledge of 
God and of Salvation must be like a man 
walking over a precipice impelled there by some 
unknown power, and unable to save himself 
from falling into the gulf below. --  without 
offending the [clergy] priests of any denomination, [for] 
I believe that in all ages there has been nothing [is sufficiently] too infamous for 
some of them to transact. - I still believe there
1735 "The painful truth becomes too clear to be suppressed
that when men are leagued in support of a system, they
will resort to craft and dishonestly in defence of it, that they
will feel acts of this kind, not sins, but duties: that
the habt and rule of their life will have more & more tendency
to become one of untruth in proportion as they feel more
distinctly that truth and the system are identical'
Professor Maurice (prayerbook pp 124).
12

must have been some among them (men) truly convinced 
of the Doctrine they preached - and [?] there 
the whole body of the protestant [?], do they 
believe against their reason? do they appear to man 
under a disguise of hypocrisy and blaspheme the 
Almighty by an avowal of a religion which is 
Contrary to that entertained in their hearts? because 
they will not break through the shallow sands of 
Conventional religion, This is what the Author 
of What is Truth calls the "Obligation of belief" 
If these thousands of men who bow in daily 
and sincere reverence of the Holy Trinity believe 
what is right and true to them why should they 
profess to man to believe different - they do not do so - 

7435 1735 The [?] religion as practiced by an 
from forms and rites prepared by the [?] Churches [cannot be?] 
[not] correct - but out of that and with the New 
Testament solely for its foundation and with the 
life of Jesus Christ for its standard without 
priests and without clergy - The true religion 
might be formed a religion that from its 
very simplicity and its clearness, and its purity 
would convert the heathen and convince the 
Sceptic. but this religion must be formed solely 
for the Spirit of Man, nothing worldly, nothing 
fleshly must have influence on it. and I think 
that if men in their character as Clergy were not 
allowed to take part, avarice, selfishness & envy 
would be excluded.

7436 1736 The Author of what is Truth seems 
to believe himself. not only a Judge of his fellow 
men in the most secret workings of their Soul
13

but also to judge the Almighty - he states in one 
place that it is the pleasure of the Almighty 
to keep his works a Secret from his people 
and he submissively declines the Knowledge 
as being unnecessary to man - and in another 
place he calls him a demon for Sacrificing 
the innocence & purity of his son for the guilt 
and crimes of men.

7437 1737 I think it would be more fit for him 
or any other man either to receive the Knowledge 
which the Almighty has given man of himself 
through any means whatever, and study it 
to the utmost of his comprehension - put that 
evidence together, and draw from it his conclusions 
(there can be nothing wrong in this) or else 
leave it without a remark acknowledging his 
incapability of forming any idea of a Supreme 
Being, or of his works. - and his belief that 
it is unnecessary to the essential part of his 
belief - by doing either of these he would show 
himself to be a true [Man?] - the simplest and 
the least among men could belong to the latter 
whilst the most researching, the most learned 
and the wisest would find in the former 
sufficient food for the most intense study.

7438 1738

You can find through the writings of 
GR. that he has a firm will and a true heart 
but a sadly misdirected mind, I would entreat 
him before going further in a cause which must 
eventually entail misery upon himself & others 
for by publishing his opinions strongly - he certainly 
obtains followers - to earnestly pray to the one God
14

of Nature to endow him with his holy influence and 
I firmly believe that no other production the Same as 
the enquiry into Truth will ever come from his hands

7439 1739 He reasons in that book solely from his 
own Strength and not in obedience to any power 
greater than his own. - He perverts the lines taken 
from Dante's Inferno. to meet his own views., they 
might be justly altered as a warning to the readers 
of his book placed upon the [Cover?] of that

"Let those who believe in this leave hope beyond" 
for assumedly our hopes of Salvation can ever enter 
the hearts of those who are led by him to question 
even the immortality of Souls. - 

May I ask if you will kindly continue next [?].

7440 1740 I will do so

May I ask &c.

7441 1741 A moment it was my intention when I 
made the beginning of my remarks upon the 
book now before for you that they should be 
but suggestions for you to fill in, that 
you might later the words if you so found 
it necessary still adhering to the sense 
I feel that I cannot meet every 
argument that might arise from 
man, and that knowing him better 
you would be able to place those views 
so that they might be more readily 
received

I explained that if it was necessary I would do so 
under his guidance

7442 1742 I wish that you would do so

1/4 to 11 PM.
I asked a question (now unknown)

7443 1743 I will answer it at some length another Evening

I then read the 4th letter I asked if I had made myself 
understood

7444 1744 You have.

A [Romanism?]

"Here also, we exclaim is a case of Superstition, that has had 
an existence, and a fearfully appalling one, too, when viewed in the 
results that have attended it, for the best part of 2000 years; a Superstition 
'introduced by a degenerate race' and for selfish and sinister end, that 
spreads itself age after age until 'the huge [?] of [snow?]' put out all 
the lights in the firmament, and involved in utter darkness the [whole] 
entire face of Europe; a superstition that has [ministered?] corruption to 
the priesthood of a better religion than that of [?], and bondage - 
physical, moral, spiritual, to whole nations of men; a superstition 
that in the name of religion, and during the entire course of its history 
has been the death of millions - men, fathers, wives, & children; a 
superstition that still exists, although modified through causes 
foreign to itself, and for which therefore no credit can be taken to itself, 
decrepit through age but still breathing out threatenings & slaughter, 
and growling out vengeance from those gloomy [?] to which any 
advancing light has driven it - need we say that we refer to the 
Superstition which has permitted the force of human authority 
and of the temporal power to meddle with matters pertaining to 
conscience and religion - From the days of Constantine until 
now has this great evil grown up along with the nominal 
advancement of the Religion of Christ and his Apostles, corrupting 
and emasculating its doctrines, formalizing its worship, rendering 
its Clergy the [?] functionaries of the Evil power, doing its 
best to stifle the voice of Truth and free inquiry, giving exclusive 
privileges to such as [?] fall into the Ranks of a 
State appointed and state paid hierarchy, excommunicating all 
who think for themselves, and worship God according to the dictates 
of their

[?]die 19 June 1855 1/2 past 8. Invoked the CA.

read. Letter 4.

1745 [I think with] The author of what is truth 
seems to think himself the only creature upon Earth 
who can act and think alone [?] & unprejudiced 
and solely relying on those innate faculties which he 
believes exist[s] in man - the Image of God which 
he argues that all men (excepting of course himself) 
are the Stars of System. - and that education 
implants in their mind a form of religion that 
must be adhered to by them. through life - even when 
they have the opportunity and the will to believe 
otherwise - but it is not so - granted that Education 
forms a mans principles and gives him a faith 
upon which he may rely, circumstances & after 
convictions can change that belief, and there are 
circumstances in every mans life that offer 
opportunity for him to be convicted from one faith 
to another. -

7446 1746 Surely Amongst all those who believe 
in the Christian religion and are firmly convinced 
of its truth - there are those who have examined its 
Truths - there are some who believe in the book of God 
and the death of is Son from Conviction & love 
instead of reason fear and youthful Education - 
are not all those who are convicted from the 
[*a*] Roman Catholic Creed - the Jews - and the 
worshippers of Idols made to feel the Conviction of 
the Sincere truth of the Holy book of God, before 
they receive it, instead of the Religion in which 
they have been Educated.

7447 1747 Passing over this part he next quotes 
St. Hilary for an authority who expresses his views 
on the presumption of man in trying to elucidate
of their own consciences [excommunicating all who think for themselves] 
coercing the people into submission, wherever they have not been 
strong enough to conduct an effectual resistance, using the [axe] 
Rack, the Screw, the Axe, the stake, the dungeon and the sword
to effectuate its selfish and despotic Ends. - We call for 
Witnesses to the truth of our Allegations, and from 10 thousand 
places, and issuing from every age during which this superstition 
has existed the Cry is 'we come! we come! Scarce a spot in 
Europe that is not hallowed by the dust of martyrs, not self-immolated 
as in the case of the Suttee, but compelled to suffer 
under this tremendous Evil, the so-called heretics and Cathari 
of an early period the Vaudois, Waldenses, and Albigenses, the 
Leonistae, Patarini, and Turpelini, the Picards, Lombards, and 
Beghards, The Paulicians and Lollards, the Wickliffites and 
Hussites, the victims of the inquisition in Rome, Spain & Portugal 
the Huguenots of France, the Puritans, and Nonconformists of 
England - These are but a portion of those who rise at our 
Invocation to Testify to the injustice misery and woe which 
this Superstition has engendered - and yet we are not without 
hope, that it will not be undermined and destroyed by the 
very weapons of Truth and reason that abolished the Sacrifice 
of Suttee in India. -

1749 'What is nature'? - 'What is mind?' - We who live
amidst the one, and possess the other can give no answer - 
We know no more of either than if they were not -
16
those things which are but partly explained to him
he would make Man believe that he commits a
crime in using those mighty powers with which
he is endowed to further his belief and purify
his views,   and exalt his mind above the things 
of Earth by bringing it in unison through thought
and study with his Superior Image in heaven

1748   7448  The Almighty has not given man
knowledge of himself, because it is not essentially
necessary that man should know it — In all
that he has revealed to man the good of the
human race has been his sole object — Himself
he has allowed to remain as mysterious; as he
is great.    but he has never forbidden  man to
seek a knowledge of himself as far as human
understanding, and human mind can attain
— far different from this — he has given him the
very ground work on which to raise all his
ideas by declaring that man is made in his 
Image — and although he must ever remain
to man a being too great for his finite
comprehension, he can strive to attain knowledge
of him, and by so doing he can attain
perfection — more — he can obtain grace —

1749   7449   The author makes  no distinction 
between nature and God -- he believes one to be
inseparable from the other -- This doctrine
may rivet the attention of its readers, written as it
is there and backed by seeming proofs [?] in the old Test of crimes
and injustice, it may raise doubts in the minds
of even it Christian readers. -- But although
it does arrest their attention - their hearts can
17

never receive from a belief in Nature that sure and 
Certain hope which a belief in God as revealed thro' 
the Scriptures calls forth from the very soul of man 
However devoutly he may believe in Nature being 
God.  that belief must always be confined to Nature and 
therefore to the Earth - He cannot pass thro this life 
with a sincere faith, and Knowledge through that faith 
of a life of Everlasting bliss beyond - Death must have 
induced terrors when it is looked forward to as the 
yawning gulf of eternal oblivion
     How different from this is sincere 
belief in those glad tidings of great joy which 
assure to all, eternal bliss that man knoweth not 
of in the presence of the God who made the Earth 
who made man to dwell upon the Earth, and who 
is now preparing that future, which shall recieve 
him for his merits while thereon.

1750   7450   The Author mentions successively extracting
from the Old Testament which he has selected to 
prove that the Jews being the worst of the human 
race - have recieved the greatest favor from God 
He must remember that the Jews have always 
been a persecuted race - much Evil has been assigned 
to them by their Enemies - which was never done by 
them - and that the relation of the mediation of 
God in their behalf on earth as recorded by themselves 
is not written by Inspiration.

1757  7457   He is Emphatically named God of 
the Jews several times but it is not in distinction 
of his Favor towards that race any more than 
another - He is the same God to the Jew, the 
Gentile and the Heathen so called by those who
18
persecute them - and if He shows more love and
more mercy towards one race than another, it is
because they are more in [?] & more danger and 
therefore more worthy to be redeemed.

7452
1752   The author asserts that the coming of
Jesus Christ upon earth for the teaching of Man   [*/15*]
and his death upon the Cross for the sins of Man
is but a questionable favor because -- "he quickens"
only which he will - and damn those he will not quicken"
He artfully keeps back the knowledge that Christ
will quicken all those who believe in him - that he
gives them all the means of believing - and promises
Salvation unto all who do not deny him.

7453
1753    In a remark made shortly before the
Conclusion of the 4th letter we have unmistakable [*page 31*]
Evidence that the author doubts the existence of a
Spiritual life - Can that religion be firm and
the faith in Gods wisdom and Mercy sincere that
doubts this the greatest of All -  was man then
created only to Live the short hour of his Existance
to be withered up and die as the grass? - did he
recieve the Mind to comprehend and the memory
to retain the Knowledge he can recieve by all his
wonderful faculties - did he recieve the feelings
of the Mind and the passions of the heart for no
other purpose than to give happiness or misery at
Intervals to a life they could not keep. - Did
He show man his undying love for him by making
all the rest of his Creation Subservient to his will
that he might use it and abuse it - without being
called to account - and having Served his pleasure
So far as fancy and want desired - All creation
might with him die the death that knows no Waking!

with reverence and respect as emanating
from the inspiration of God, the whole
must be recieved the same.  and if

May I observe that Mrs. P's views are not of material

would not make that Creation so fair

render him nearer and more thoughtful 
to them who sincerely worship him

to appreciate the wants of man

As to my going to the North

7470   Altho in that time I shall no be able

that these Communications may continue

wish to call me   I wish most earnestly 
and believe me it is for your own benefit 
that you should not travel upon water 
I am perfectly convinced there is great 
danger in it to you

Shall I now read the 5th Letter.

1771 
7471  A moment first, I am much gratified 
to be able to give you this evening a remedy 
for the Effects of these Visions upon your 
Seers Eyes -
     My appearance here, not my 
presence is occasioned by a great body of 
Electricity by which I am surrounded 
this electricity is forced forward against 
the Eyes of the Seer -
     The human Eye is a conductor of 
light as well as an Emittor, now whether 
this Electrical current can send the 
natural light back into the Eye or not 
depends the Vision, then this 
Electric light has operated upon the Eyes
18
e
1771
7471
for many successive times , it leaves the
natural sight less able to resist it, and
thus forcing itself upon the  eye externally
it drives the sight of the eye inwardly
and the strength of that collects a film
that works upon the brain, and thus
the pressure and straining sensation which
usually arises but the pain is not so
much felt until the Electricity goes
away with the vision and the sight
forces itself back to its natural position
The Effect and feeling on the Eye is 
precisely the same as a stroke of
lightning catching the Eye directly, the
only remedy for this is to have common
glass Spectacles set in Steel wire the
coarser the better, glass being a conductor
and steel also , they will draw the Electy
and focus it upon themselves without the
least influence upon the natural sight
but these glasses must be smoked so
that the light being attracted towards
them should not be blinding

May I observe you mention glass as a conductor
it is generally supposed to be a non-Conductor
1772
7472
Glass is a powerful Conductor, it attracts
the heat and light from the Sun but
while it conducts the whole force of
heat and light it preserves the human
body especially, from the Sulphur for by
no other earthly name can I call it,
that has such baneful Effects upon all that

only with the intention of benefitting 
yourselves.

1774 
7474  You can 
Light Electricity & their unlimited 
powers over creation may indeed form a 
deep and interesting study to man 
different from the Author of what is 
Truth. I would most willingly encourage 
and applaud all those who strive to 
attain the Knowledge of those boundless 
powers & wonderful mechanism which 
the ignorant and the blinded believe are 
unattainable, those mighty Spiritual powers 
which begin with the smallest atom 
of Gods Creation, and leads man through 
a Seemingly impracticable labyrinth 
which dissolves before his earnest gaze 
through the whole of Creation, and 
at last to God himself

I returned thanks

1775 
7475  I wish you to read the two Chapters

is nothing that I have not answered

answer to that and the next without 
interruption -

1776 
7476  To go further than this, when the human 
race is extinct and the End of the world is Come 
for to the Almighty Time is as nothing would he 
create another world on the same principle 
and without any cause - and so go on for all 
Eternity - killing what he creates - destroying that 
which he gives so fair a promise of life, by 
making the opening on Earth so beautiful - No 
it is blasphemy to believe it - In creating those 
magnificent works he had a purpose worthy 
of himself - all other inhabited bodies besides 
the Earth blend in union towards one Eternal life 
and when at the last day  The Truth  is known to all 
how woefully will those find themselves decieved, who 
have relied upon their own strength in discovering the 
Truth - I would liken him to a boat without 
a rudder and without oars after being driven. about 
by conflicting Storms driven against a City on which 
he finds no port

Read to the CA. Chap. 5 & 6

have I made myself understood

7481 1781 You have 
Men are not all base hypocrites and     [*p. 57 40*] 
Cringing Cowards as the author would have his 
reader believe, such do exist it is true but they 
are exceptions to a rule of nature. and I believe 
that circumstances and influences over him which 
he cannot control make him bad as he is. to those 
who have honest minds and clear & truthful hearts 
I would address myself - When they are convinced 
and there are many [thousands] mIllions of them who are 
by reason and Knowledge. and faith beyond Knowledge 
of the Truth of the Scriptures and have faith in 
the Trinity and not by wild enthusiasm for 
that which is mysterious and unknown.. and 
wilful ignorance of that which is intelligible 
and clear. - (See opposite) of those with a clear heart and 
Free will I would ask this question.

7482 1782   Do they feel from that innate 
Conviction which the author professes to believe 
can never lead man wrong, that the prayers 
and thanksgivings which they devoutly offer 
up to the Throne of Grace are rejected as being 
unworthy of hearing because he who addresses 
them cannot wholly understand the being he 
addresses, does one morally convinced of the 
Truth of the scriptures ever feel that his prayers 
are unheeded or denied — They do not — and 
must not that religion be better & more truthful 
which gives him a hold upon Eternal life 
and perfect confidence and Trust in one Eternal 
Energy working for his good then that religion 
if it may be so called, which he who believes in
21

it professes to know not whether it exists in one 
Eternal life always acting, or whether it is but the 
Consequences of one great cause - a faith, which leaves 
man in utter ignorance as to every thing beyond 
the possession of the day, and yet that same man 
tells you, that it is the height of wisdom to confess 
ignorance of al those things, which because they 
are not indelibly worked upon Creation or written 
in his own heart are unnecessary for him to learn   [*34*]

1783   7483   It is in this as in many other things 
men cannot recieve any thing with belief unless 
it is felt by them through their Senses, they 
cannot recieve that which is only apparent to 
their Mind - The Author denies that revealed 
religion can[not] agree[s] with Natural Religion, in 
his words to believe one is to blaspheme the other, 
but it is not so looking at them aught they 
both agree - one indeed is part of the other, and 
recieving one truly you cannot reject the other, for 
looking back to the beginning of Creation the 
necessity of a living God., the necessity of a 
Saviour must be obvious to all, For the expulsion 
of that Satanic influence, which began in the 
garden of Eden. it was necessary that an acting 
power should exist, that power must have been 
good to relieve man of the Evil that he had 
brought upon himself and to remove him to a 
place where he should not be tempted again, 
     And if, as the author states the prayers of Man 
are received by Him, as from creatures grovelling 
in he dust, why should he use his influence 
direct to save man when his Aid was unmasked 
and if he gave his Aid in the time of sore distress
"Whatever encroachments my have been attempted on the 
Rights or the Dignity of the Sovereign, and whatever Legislative 
measures may have been necessary for the maintenance of 
those rights and that dignity, it should always be carefully 
borne in mind - That each man's religious persuasion 
must be defended, and can only be defended by himself 
As his faith cannot be wrested from him against his will 
by the act of another so neither can it be maintained in 
its purity by [its] Legal enactments

Devices & tricks of Statesmen & Priests to rest upon, it could not have stood 
at all; for that these are very weak things indeed, which when they 
are left to themselves, a popular tempest must carry utterly away.  if
they have lasted a single day it must have been because they had 
something better, truer than themselves to sustain them - 
This better, truer thing it leaves to be allowed must be that very Faith 
in mens hearts upon which so many disparaging Epithets were 
Cast & which it was supposed, could [no] produce no fruits that were 
not Evil & hurtful - Faith it is now submitted has been the most 
patent instrument of Good to the World - has given to it nearly 
all which it can call precious"

to one who had acted directly contrary to his commands
how much less would he withold it from those who
humbly ask ---

1784  7484   He states that no honest mind
can totally agree with any code of Religion -- He
can with the religion but not with the dogmas
that priestly craft have placed around  it  [he] man gets
confined when he enters a labyrynth in which
appears so many contradictory turnings -- In
choosing a religion man should not trust to other
men, were they all to act with unbiassed 
Judgment  and choose that, even if it were parts
from all the different religions upon the Earth,.
which he could fully understand & believe, and
not agree with one form because some of the
features of that form met his own.

1785  7485   Thus he might believe in the 
Divinity of Christ as given in the New Testament
without rushing headlong into it and believing
without connection that every word of the Old
Testament was inspired  when his Mind tells
him, his Knowledge of Truth tells him that
the one does not agree with the other.  and that
there is much in it  Omnipotence, purity and
Judgment would Condemn.

1786  7486  The author here treats the Old Test't
the same as the New, and although he loudly
denounces the old he gives an illustration of
a passage in the old Testament which he treats
as exactly on the same footing with the life of
Jesus Christ -- All those personages [?]
in the old Testament and they are very numerous
"Let us again, instance the state Church, among[st] us: how many
"Mute Millons" and "inglorious" Paleys verge the year long towards
Starvation on miserable Curacies of £80 per anum: while

'Bishops'
       "The past month has been a terrible time for the Bishops
it will be long remembered by members of the Episcopal Bench
and ought to cover them with humiliation & shame. ---
       What we complain of is that a system should be elaborated
which renders it almost impossible for a man to retain his
virtue in connection with a Mitre. --
       The temporalities of the Church are sacred, for the Laity
to which them is sacrilege; they are consecrated to a Divine
End, and cannot be abreviated without impiety. -- Such are
the views broached by our Churchmen - and yet it is ever
proved beyond all doubt;  that the Dignitaries of the Church
& the Bishops especially - have been recklessly and without
shame enriching themselves at the Cost of the Church --
there has been a perfect scramble after wealth, money has
been the God of their Idolatry --
       The words used by Mr Horsman on the 17th. may have
been indiscreet, but they were true, the wisdom of uttering them
may be doubted, but the description they give is strictly
correct, the picture is a revolting one, it is nevertheless
lifelike. ---

he seems to expect although human & living upon
Earth are true and good as their Creator - but the
Same Sin that is now among men, the Same
Sin that will make a Bishop pocket 14 or 15000 a year [Clergyman] of the Church of
England or Clergymen pocket 14 or 1500[0] every year and give
out of it a poor [slave of a] Curate 40 or 50 £ a year
to do the drudgery of his work - and yet call themselves
[a] Ministers and a Chosen ones of God. - would make
in centuries gone by a poor Son of a persecuted race
take from sheer want the treasure of another & that
was very small - and then lie to make that treasure
more Secure. - The lie was not altogether wilful
for having taken the treasure belonging to his brother
it appeared to him that he was under the influence
of a more than human power - every thing
seemed to prosper with him after this Sinful
Act and although he could not know that it
was the Almighty that supported him - he cheated
himself with the belief that it was So. - But
treating this only as the True record & history
of the times, of things right and wrong, that
were happening amongst men, and amongst them
who were prophets and Diviners, and those who
Sought Knowledge of the Future - it does not
in any way involve the Almighty.

7487
1287 After this and as he believes showing
that Christ and the Jewish prophets were equally untrue
equally deceitful, equally unmerciful & unjust

Few are aware of the labor involved in these enquiries. the
malpractices of a Bishop cannot be exposed without raising
the anger of many, and few terms are too opprobrious [to such]
to be applied to such as have sufficient courage to undertake
the task. --
     The eyes of the Nation are upon them their wrong
doing is known to all;  the veneration in which they were
formerly held is gone; Superstitious reverence for Episcopal
functions is known only to Church wardens & old Ladies.

Same meaning as "Judge not that Ye be not judged"
his meaning was. [That] when men advanced opinions
at which yours were at [war] variance, when they obstinately
stood in them and you saw no ways of convincing
them otherways - when they were powerful, And
you were weak You should be silent. And if
they believed that that silince gave Consent, it
would make men at peace with you  that would
otherwise be your Enemies - he gives nothing here
but what is disinheritedly for mans good and 
which can be complied with by him with truth
and [wit] propriety & save a [?] [aimless?] charity home

1789   7489   The Author says that the highest,
the finest and the best of Mans Aspirations
are for Earth and that whenever his thoughts or
his wishes are turned to the world beyond, they
are centered upon himself and he argues as this
"what shall it profit a Man if he gains the
whole world and loses his own Soul - does he
consider how insignificant his life is to eternity
how brief the moment of his existence when
compared to the long eternity that has no End
could he in a thing which involves such mighty
interest  Sacrifice his own Soul to save anothers
Man dare not do this - [the present is his own]
the present is his own in that time he can
Strive to do for others as much as is in Mans
power he then can teach other men the principle
he himself acts upon and believes to be right
All his Corporeal faculties - All his Mind
and all his Strength he can exert to do good
to other Men - but the fortune is Gods and the

Soul of Man is in his keeping - and the first
and greatest object in mans life must be to make
that keeping safe -.  to preserve his soul in the
hands of the almighty and make himself
worthy of receiving happiness which has
no End.

The honest confessions of all the parties who had contributed

Alcunius and the Clementine Editors were substantially

7494
1794  [*?*]    There is nothing mentioned [in this 
chapter] more than he has before touched upon but in 
different words.

7495
1795   I do not seek to palliate the offences of 
those he has mentioned in this chapter, for however 
painful and degrading and blasphemous to Almighty 
purity and Truth the written lives of those men may 
be when it is divested of all mystery, of all pretence 
to the knowledge and direction of God, and looked 
upon solely as the Record of the times -  as solely 
the works of men having power on Earth - of Sovereigns 
existing when their will was the only known Law -- 
of advisers - and pretended divines - the first to commit 
the Sin, the second to advise, and the third to pardon 
and absolve -  looked upon solely in this light 
[that book] More men have many rivals in the present [day] time. [*38*]
[Solomon & David], Isaac & Jacob,  David & Solomon have many    [*46*]
counterparts at this day. --  I think these passages 
alone must raise an objection in the mind of an 
honest and candid enquirer as to the Truth of the 
Old Testament being written by Inspiration of being 
a relation of persons and things guided & governed 
by Gods purity and Truth.

7496
1796   Yet There does not seem much wisdom in the 
remark that men have only the Credulity of the nursery   [*45*]
in regard to Religion - it is from the very reason of 
men having labored so much that they have required 
so little - how many men have read the scriptures 
dissected them - written volumes on volumes upon 
them - stretched every faculty of the mind, have spent 
their whole lifetime in trying to discover their meaning
27
and merit, and yet have passed over the simple truth
that is indelibly engraved upon every page of the New
Testament, because they have not recieved it, in the Spirit
that it is intended - they have not when beginning that 
book sought assistance from where that assistance could 
be alone [well] found  -  they have not placed reliance in the
God of Nature, and the God of Man.  to open the Secret
Springs of the heart. ,  that that might recieve the
Divine teachings and inculcations written therein and
reject the Mortal [weaknesses and cares] weaknesses
and errors of which the book alone has many.

I then read Chapter 8.
have I made myself understood

1797  You have.

Chap 8

7498
1798 In this 8th chapter more than in any other [he] GR
shows us how weak and how shadowy his belief [*page 55*]
must be, how unsatisfying his religion based only on [*52*]
the creator of Nature, and [on] not on the living God of [*53*]
man. - when that religion even does not give him the
hopes of a Faith in the Life beyond

7499
1799 Can he believe that the Almighty created
Nature with only life and motion, and then made Man
[with] the image of himself, with the light of his own
being in him - gave mind and every faculty of the
brain, and of the heart, and of the Soul to appreciate
and to understand the rest of Creation - that the God
who gave him Free will and discretion and Judgment
over his own actions, and of right and wrong, would
destine him to a premature decay, after passing
through a life that to no man is happiness - would
he give him a desire for immortality - without satisfying
the desire he himself had created - why make Man
above the rest of Creation if a higher destiny does not
await him, would it not be more just and more
merciful to make him insensible to all beyond mere
Animal enjoyment, if he had intended that he should
wither up and die only to give place to others of the
Same Kind - The Knowledge of a Soul lives in the
human heart.

♃ die  31 July       C. A Mirror
                  Invoked the C A.
The C A is here in white

1804   7504 I thank God that I can welcome you
 again in safety
     I ask answer you questions

I present on     Ev'g  at Mr Robert Owens meeting for
the announcement of his belief in spiritual manifestations
At his request Mrs.           a friend of ours read your 
communication to him. 

1805  7505  I wish that to be made public which
I know to be true I   am therefore grateful
to Mr Owen for the steps he has taken.

When at Mr. Owens meeting Mrs. Hall a friend of Mr.
Owens gave me a sad acct of an unaccountable malady
which has afflicted her son now abt 14 or 15 years old
for the past 2 years.  she has sent me the writings
& drawings of his which I will place ag't the
mirror,  can you kindly tell me what treatment
would be beneficial to him.

1806  7506   I believe mesmerism would be [?]
if properly applied - strong [mesmerick?]
[?] should be first given to him, and
that continually and resolutely, paying
no attention to his liking or disliking 
it. -- if he continues to scream as is
possible when this is administered
let him to do so until he is exhausted
then mesmerism should be tried
strongly upon him while in this
weak state  and should be continued
the will acting powerfully upon him
until he again revives by this means
he will be gradually brought under the will
of the operator
The mesmeriser must be a man.

how long before he is mesmerised should the mesmerised
water be given to him to drink

1807  7509  So long as he will take it willingly when
he shows violence at it, meserism must be
tried upon him.

My friend Mr H D Lea informs me of his continued
ill success, may I again beg your kind advice

1809  7509  You spoke to me some time since of a
Gentleman that I much respect wishing to
be present when you receive my communication
I am willing to receive him when it is
convenient to you, I will give you an [?]
to the Chapter  which you can now read
in What is Truth
     It is desirable it should be finished
as speedily as possible

I read letter 9.
29 1/2

                     Chapter 9
7510
1810 How can the author of what is truth
believe that [where] were Christian Doctrines the only 
true religion there would be no dissention or opposition
throughout the world, when minds as antagonistic
and Spirits as obstinately proud as his own
exist in every part __ Christ showed men the 
way to salvation,  He did more he pleaded for
them to the author of his existence, he died by
the hands of his Enemies, those to whom he would 
have given immortality refused him even their
criminal life -- but although they had done this
he still entreated that they might be numbered 
among the blessed "Father forgive them, for they
know not what they do."

1811
7571   His enemies exist now as then, it is
not his fault that men deny him & place
themselves without the pale of his mercy, It
rests with man himself whether he will be of
the Chosen few the receivers of Immortal life.

7572 
1812   Christ gave the means of Salvation
to all men and of        glad tidings of great        [*?*]
Joy.  none were cast aside as unworthy because
they did not agree with inward connections, blind 
self reliance and heathen pride, is it the fault 
of Christ or of man -- can it be expected that those
who will not acknowledge his merits who blaspheme
him or who only appear to believe in him to suit
their own interests -- those who are "obliged to believe"
can it be expected that those will be received at the
1844
     The only thing which can be pleasing to God, and can
consiliate his love, is moral excellence, if the sufferings 
of Christ in themselves were not the object of Divine complacency,
yet the meek and gentle, and holy spirit of the sufferer
must have been well pleasing in the sight of his Holy Father
      With what complacency must God have looked upon
that self  devoted,  self sacrificing spirit, which induced
the Saviour to submit to "so great a death," "to become obed't
to death  even  to the death of the Cross!"  with what approb'n
must [the Father] God have heard the submissive voice of
Jesus  when he said in his agony "not my will but thine
be done"!                                Rob. Halley  DD.
                                          Congregational Lecture  Part 2.  1857

That
throne of Grace the same as those who through 
faith have been made whole.

7573
1813 He died to save the sinner, but before 
that death could be effectual, the sinner must
repent of his sins, although he quickens only
whom he will, he has told man unmistakeably
that all who believe in him shall be saved, and
therefore he will quicken all his followers and
those who will not believe, those who require
Knowledge and have no faith, those in justice
to the true believers must be cast back. for if
the prize is not worthy of being attained, why
should man strive for it, and it would be no
prize to those who had been the faithful
followers of Christ through the conflicts & battle
of Life, if they were to receive salvation in the
same manner and on the same terms as those
who had died in Sin without repentance

7574
1814 The Author must remember that when
Jesus Christ was on Earth he was in the flesh
that he had all the feelings of Man, that he had
Strongly to guard against its weakness & its sin
that in the flesh he was sorely tried. that he
was subject to all temptation, that in battling
against Sin and in praying for courage
to undergo his bodily trials sweat of blood
rolled from his brow. at these times he was
allowed to be tempted that he might show his
mighty power in overcoming it.

1815
7575 When he went up into the exceeding
31
high mountain to pray it may be presumed he was not spoken to
as [was] [?] supposed, by an infernal Spirit
by the prince of Darkness -- it was his mind
communing with itself, when he knew that the hour
of danger approached, that he was persecuted &
hated by many men, his mind Suggested 
the idea of fleeing from it. of turning his face
from his Father, and of becoming a man of Sin
but the inspiration he had received from his Father
overcame it -- The still small voice rose in 
rebellion against the Evil suggestion & with pride
in his [innocense ?] and reliance upon Heaven he
exclaimed "Get thee behind me Satan for it is
written thou shalt worship the Lord thy God
and him only shalt thou serve.

1816  7516  This feeling [which he had at this time]
has been experienced by almost every man
particularly by those who have committed a first
sin of any magnitude, they ave felt a
reluctance to commit it because it was wrong
but too often the Evil has triumphed over the
good -- Well [it] would it be for man were 
the example of the Saviour at such times in
mind

May I &c

1817   7517  I have nothing this Evening

I read    Chapter 10

7520  That chapter must be passed over  it contains
nothing more than I have made remarks upon
in others.

read Chapter 11. 

7521
1821  God Condemns Jesus Christ at the
end of [that  C   /  Chapter] letter for the same boast, the 
same feeling of self sufficiency and of pride in
his own strength., wrongfully, that he prides himself
upon having in the beginning

1822
7522  He is proud of being able to stand
alone, to throw off all prejudices, all early impressions
All teaching from Superior and Elevating sources, and
relies soley upon his own innate sense of right
and wrong. upon his own wisdom and his own
reason, and having elevated himself to this
commanding position of Recieving Truth only through
his own senses, he looks without even human Charity
upon the whole of the human Creation as not only
the degraded creatures of an offended God. not only
as grovelling blasthemers in the Sight of Almighty
[?] - but as men all and each denying to
each other their real sentiments, and hiding under
the most diabolical cloak of hypocrisy their real
feelings both to God & man. -  This he calls "the
obligation of belief="

7523
1523  Before he can arrive at the truth
he so much covets he must lower his standard of
self importance and look with human benevolence
upon the Multitude.  and he will find amongst
the ignorant and the Cultivated mind, the refined
and the Vulgar. , the Aristocrat & the peasant, the
same Holy Spirit of Light, the same undying
1824.  I offer no apology for those expressions in our Ordination
of priests, when the Bishop lays his hands upon the head of a 
weak youth and says "Recieve the Holy Ghost for the office 
of a priest Christs Church".   I say Boldly that 
youth ought to believe that he is endowed with this
power; else he will not do Christs work, or feel his own
nothingness, or be the helper and deliverer of his Brethren
                                Professor Maurice 'Church or Family
                                                   1850 p.169. 
-- Boldly --  If a weak youth ought to believe that he is endowed
                    with this power, else he will not do Christs work
                    are we to infer that if he does believe He will
                    do Christs work . --
                     Now as plundering nay downright robbing the
                     poorer members of the Church, as Mr Horsman has
                     proved the Bishop of Durham & other Bishops to 
                     have done which is essentially opposed to Christs work 
                     what are we to consider them  Believers or
                     disbelievers in the Apostolic laying on of hands.
1824  Apostolical Bishops!
     At the decease of the political Bishop Bathurst    Dr Stanley found
the See in a deplorable state
     "Non residence, pluralities, one instead of two Services, once a
week, or sometimes once a fortnight -- an abuse which had reached
such a pitch as to have produced one instance in which fifteen
churches were served by three brothers; !  carelessness in admission
to holy orders; imperfect administration of the rites of Baptism
and burial. -- page 30 -- [Addresses & Charges of] Ed. Stanley D D.
                          late Bishop of Norwich ! [with] [?] by John Alexander
                          [A P Stanley M A.] -- London 1851.
1824  Political Priests.
     "When pressed by the son of Bishop Bathurst for the Vacant
bishoprick of Kellalve in reward for his Fathers political services
Lord Melborne refused, but accompanied his refusal with the

33
conviction of Truth.  which that spirit must always
carry with it, the same fearless belief in the
Divinity and the Glorification of Christ. -- and this
without craven fear of priests or their forms & Ceremonies

1824   7524   Minds such as these are not found
in absorbed attention to the inspired tones of a 
Bishop rising from a pulpit -- they are not
found at stated intervals assembled together in
one place for the same purpose of repeating the
same words in a form of prayer which they have
the Knowledge and even intention of [breaking?]
during the interval of another Ceremony. --
The prayers only acceptable to God are those rising
spontaneously from an overcharged heart, and
there the workings of His Holy Spirit are found

1825   7525   It is one of the greatest errors fallen
into by man of rushing from one extreme to another
they mostly believe and judge one another by
[that] the belief that a man must either be a great
sinner or a great saint, to be the latter he must
conform to all religious ceremonies, he must
show every outward sign of Grace.  that is
quite sufficient -- They have not the Charity
to believe that truth and goodness can exist
without Show. -- They have not the faith beyond
knowledge which is "so necessary" even in their
fellow creatures motives -----  If man requires
this faith beyond knowledge to justify others actions
in this world -- and it is required in the Commonest
events of life, how much more does he require
it when his own welfare spiritually is concerned
1834 Apostolic Bishops
the offer of the Archbishopric of Dublin to the father - that father
being so incapacitated at the very time as scarcely to understand
the communication of the premier, if indeed which we doubt, it
was ever made known to him  =

34

How vastly of more consequence that faith beyond
Knowledge must be if through it he gains the 
Kingdom of Heaven - and Man gives this 
faith beyond Knowledge in life every moment
and under every circumstance it is required. If
he gives it when the Sun sets at night what
gives him a certainty that it will rise on the 
morrow. his Knowledge only extends to the fact
of its setting - his faith makes him sure that
it will rise, and if faith Can be given to the 
second rising of the Sun that illumes this Earth
why not extend that faith beyond Knowledge 
to the Son of Light rising on the World to Come

Have I your permission to read the 12th letter

7526
1826 You have
 
I read Chapter 12

1827  My remarks on this will be in 
Continuation of my last.
35
                            Chapter 12the.
7528
1828     The Author believes that no knowledge 
can exist in man of his own soul. -- The knowledge
of the Human Soul -- from what does it arise? 
Those innate principles which G.R so much
relies upon seem now at fault, for the knowledge
of the Human Soul is felt by every human
created being, if they can rightly understand and
interpret their own feelings -- they [are] know
that they are superior to all other creation, they 
feel a closer affinity to a power above than
below them -- that superiority consists in the 
mind. The power of Comprehension, of memory
of Eloquence, of Language, of Reason, and of
thought. -- The mind with its wonderful endowments
and manifold changes. -- Man feels that it 
is something within him superior to Earth.
Superior even to the body that contains it,
that it is purely Spiritual, and that over it
he has but a limited control, and feeling that
it is Spiritual -- Knowing that it is Spiritual
for he knows not even it habitation in his own
body -- can he think that his spirit dies.
     If he calls that reason into action, can he
not tell that a Spiritual body is immortal,
and the mind his Spiritual body in this Earth
shall be his Spiritual body in the next world
and thus the Evidence of a Soul lies within
him 

7529
1829  If there is any other particular point
you wished remarked upon I will do so

I do not wish to appear to ignore his allusions to
to the Old Testament, I will therefore repeat the last
part of Chapter 12.
7530 1830 do so.
I reread it.
7531 1831 You are right
I would not &c  [?]
36

7532
1832   [?]  I would not have it thought 
by any that may open this book that
those points were passed over that could
not be answered, but in a former place 
treated on the same subject, I have professed
plainly that I have no faith in the Old
Testament, that I believe it inconsistent 
with the New -- The Father, the Son and
The Holy Ghost are not to be considered one
with the God of Abraham   the God of Isaac
and the God of Jacob. The old testament
contains but a record of the Times in which
it was written, it was not written under 
inspiration and is therefore unnecessary as a 
guide to Man.

7533 1833  The Old Testament and what the
Author terms Revealed Religion and Obligatory
belief make a mystery that the Red Supporters
of [the Church of England] State Churches can be paid to dissolve
after their own fashion

May I &c.

7534 1834  I have not this Evening
9.45 PM.

♂︎die  14  Aug. 1855. 1/4 to 8 PM.
                Invoked the C A.
Mr. Cate will be here on  ♀︎die next - Mr. Ormerod has also called
upon me. 

7535 1835  I have before ment'd that I should have
great pleasure on his acquaintance 

I explained, as to Mr Ormerod & Mr Cate

7536 1836 I spoke of Mr. Cate when I appeared at
your friends home. Twice then I have
alluded to this one.
Religious Love amongst Christian Communities
                     "Love one Another"
"Add to this circumstance the belief- very possibly quite
sincere - of the infinite significance of the questions
at issue, and there will no longer be any cause for
surprize at the frightful vehemence, and constant
disregard of truth which are indissolubly associated
in our minds with the words "religious newspaper"
     We have vulgar papers, we have unprincipled
papers, we have disingenous papers; but the full
bitterness which the human heart is capable of
feeling, the full ferocity it is capable of expressing
is to be met with no where but in religious papers --
we know no spectacle more frightful than that
of a "religious" writer raging with [?] spite
and taxing his generally very narrow capacity
to put into words the images familiar to a sad
heart and a gloomy imagination -- We know
of no more awful responsibility than that of
being a permanent scandal & stumbling block
to those who wish to love & serve their Maker
& a perpetual occasion to the enemies of religion to
[?]. -- Sometimes in the midst of such
displays, it is hardly possible to repress a
smile at a blundering ferocity which is at once
amusing and disgusting,  take for example the
following extracts (slightly compressed)  from an
article in last weeks Tablet on Crime in England
    "The Devil accordg to [?] any [?] &c &c
following this the Record "Evanjelical" is [?]
down as "a paper as bitter as the Tablet, but less
able and more totally unscrupulous."           Saturday [?]

I then read.  Chapter 13th

1837   7537   Much of [this Chapter] his 13th letter is but a repetition
of the preceding ones but I must again mentione one
of the authors greatest errors -- believing in the
sufficiency of the Divinity within him,  placing
sole reliance upon his innate sense of right & wrong
to teach him the whole Truth.

1838   7538   Granted that there is a Divinity within
all those who seek to do right, that the Image of
[its?] will is implanted in the human soul, what
disclosures does it make that man can rely upon
-- it brings with [him] it no knowledge -- the author
himself admits this for he is even doubtful of an
hereafter. - It gives him no hope -  It gives him 
no trust in the mercy of God towards himself -- it
teaches him nothing more than he can see with
his outward Eyes, that there is a creation and
that there must be an unaccountable, impetuous &
mighty power to create it and to rule it with such
nice precision -- this much he sees. - and this 
much only does that image implanted in his soul
reveal to him -- Other sentiments arise from
human conceptions ----------------------------------
-------------------- He boasts of a Charity which few very
few human beings can possible have -- that of
doing unto others as he would they should do
unto him -- of giving up all for the sake of
mankind -- he treats of mans own Salvation as
indifferent and his wish for it as selfish - that his
hopes of hereafter should not be personal - but for
the whole human race -- that he should do everything
that man can do, for man or for God, and this
(1840 )
The Carriage of my Lord the Bishop rolls through the 
city and the poor are sprinkled with the mud its wheels do
scatter.  All men are alike in the Eye of God; He knows
but the good and Evil, they are his sole distinctions, says
Christianity-   the practice and the feeling of social 
England say, as clearly as action can speak it - a man
as a man is nothing - he is - in proportion as he has
Cash or Birth - when you are [smitten?] [?] not again
says Christianity, for Peace is its vital essence- a peace man
is almost a term of contempt in Society; the pulpit is
the best support of the wan spirit: and Bishops Bless the
colors that are to be steeped in the blood of man and the
Tears of Orphanage and widowhood-"

statistics of his own Church  than any other living man assured

God.  and that perfection is attainable unto all
men.  Man must have a knowledge of and a
reliance upon God -- and if he is able to do
these woks of Charity & Love - the same divine
inspiration under which he acts gives him the
Fine and certain hopes of his future reward.

1839  7539  Does it seem reasonable that without a
knowledge of God   without a trust in His mercy
man can possibly have the Image of this still
implanted in his soul and act under His guidance
for surely he must do so, to meet the scorn contempt
and selfishness of man with feelings purely of
Charity & Love.

1840  7540  The author [of] having spoken of the policy
of the Country as well as the religion   I may be
allowed to do the same - assuredly in many
respects - in almost all - and especially in Religion
men teach what they do not act.  those in High
places do this more than those in low, and I
firmly believe that Truth, Unity & Concord can
never reign amongst men whilst there is so
much difference in their social position --
only make men free, give them equal right with
their fellows -- give them an honorable calling &
"A truth seeker finds the influence of the prelates derived
not from piety or personal worth, but from its Cash and the
adjuncts which their Ecclesiastical dignity bestows. Take away
from a Bishop his income, his princely habitation, and his seat
in the assembly of the peers, and the respect, reverence and adulation
he receives, go also with him. Let him be as pious as Paulinus -
but rob him of these and he sinks into quiet obscurity upon
the instant - I do not seek to Join in the wide mouthed
Vulgar cry against Bishops, but surely to the Sincere Churchman
this matter is worthy to be studied

"In no public or Social department which we know of has
money a more directly evil influence than in the Anglican Church
From the Grand Old House at Lambeth down to the humble
lodgings of the Chaplain of the workhouse the monetary
calculation is universal -- if we meet with a worthy Curate
toiling among his schools & his paupers doing as much
good as "his System" will allow him, and if we ask him
why he with his 13 children is after 30 years service is 
only a Curate the answer we invariably receive is 
" I have been without influence" - that is, being interpreted
"Neither I nor my family had money" -

"The reader may Judge for himself, how far the Clergy even
have been, or ever will be, the bulwark to protect the great
masses of the population against any tyranny of theirs
|the Middle Classes of Society |it is true indeed that in the 
days of the Monasteries, the Clergy were an intervening Estate
between the lay Aristocracy & the poor, But this was for 
a purpose of their own, they only interposed to deliver them
from the serfdom of the Soil, in order to make them the 
Still more ignorant and abject Serfs of the Church.
The two despotisms were the players, and the million
were the Stake.

and Crimes, Sin, injustice and ingratitude 
are swept from the Land. I would have Clergy  Bishops 
[Clergy] Aristocracy & Royalty [& aristocracy] things unknown. - I 
would have education given to all, through the 
Means of those who had most. and then the paths 
of life open to all who by their own merits could 
obtain them - the same situations might remain 
the same professions and the same governments, but 
let every man being educated have a chance of
obtaining distinction through his own merits - it 
would stimulate those to exertion who are now idle 
it would remove crime, because crime would be 
unnecessary, and would only be an act of 
Justice from one man to another throughout the 
Land. 

7541
1841  Heavy is it on the Shoulders of the 
High for while they preach goodness, they are 
withholding the means of attaining it - The 
Almighty did not intend that one class of men 
should take all the wealth, and the Rank and 
crush other men beneath them because they had 
not that wealth and rank. - When he created 
Adam & Eve in the garden of paradise, when he 
made them without pride and without pomp
children of nature living upon his richest gift 
and that gift the same to all their descendants 
- His own bounteous Creation

Shall I read letter 14

7542 1842  Do so

May I ask if you have any Comments

7542 1843  I wd answer them both together

Read Chapter 15.
La 1840"     "The right Divine to Govern Wrong"
The greatest curses any age has known
Have issued from the Temple or the Throne.
Extent of ill from Kings at first begins,
But priests must aid and consecrate their sins.
The tortured subject might be heard complain,
When sinking under a new weight of chain,
Or more rebellious, might perhaps repine,
When laced to dower or titled concubine,
But the priest christens all a right Divine.
When at the altar a new monarch kneels
What confined awe upon the people steals,
The chosen He adores the precious oil,
Meekly recieves the solemn charm, and while
the Priest some blessed nothings mutters o'er,
Such in the sacred grease at every pore;
He seems at once to shed his mortal skin,
And feels divinity manifested within
The trembling vulgar dread the Royal nod
And worship God's anointed more than God.
Such sanction gives the prelates to such Kings
So mischief from such hallowed fountains springs.
But lend your eyes to yonder harrassed plains
Where King and priest [to] in one united reigns!
See fair Italia mourn her holy state,
And droop oppressed beneath a papal weight;
Where fat celibacy usurps the soil,
And sacred sloth consumes the peasant's toil:
The holy drones monopolize the sky
And plunder by a vow of poverty;
The Christian cause their lewd profession taints
Unlearned, unchaste, uncharitable saints,"
             Eliot Warburton's Memoirs of Horace Walpole
                [?] Lond. 1851   Vol. 1  p. 277.

7544
1844 I will now conclude my Remarks to 
the author of what is Truth.
7545
1845 I have paid the greatest attention to
every part of your work, and I regret to say that 
I found in it nothing but error -- injustice to God
and to man -- and blasphemy of His Holy Word
7546
1846 You do not act upon the Same System
you would have others do -- and you do evil to the
Cause while you seem to do good - That of Truth -
before utterly denouncing a religion that showers
the greatest blessings on mankind -- You should
have sought deeply and enquired much -- Had
you prayed to the God, the only one that you
recognize, this book would never have been
written -- but with artful ignorance of any but
your own Strength, you make that superior intent
and understanding that you possess, and which
you must feel a part of the spiritual body
called the Soul to lead others to the destruction of
which you seem so heedless Yourself
7547
1847  When you feel that you have nothing
to support the arguments that you hold out and
the opinions which you adhere to as absolute truth
but your own slender Conviction without knowledge
and feeling without faith -- when you had nothing
to rely upon but a weak inward feeling, that
you [are] were right you would have done well to have
kept those opinions from the world.  to have kept
them within yourself and whether right or wrong
to have been yourself only responsible for their Truth.

1850  It is not here implied that the true religion is based [upon]
primarily upon the New Testament - it being obvious that
the preaching & practice of Christ & his apostles - their facts
& doctrines established & maintained.  the true religion many years before a word of the New Testament was written --.
indeed it is ancient  that it was the extension of Christianity
that occasioned the necessity for documentary Evidence
it was therefore not believed because it was written but written
because it was believed --
41

7548 1848   Surely the Inward Convictions of one man 
is not sufficient guide for a thousand, through 
life - and death - and Immortality. - then why 
send them forth into the world without more mature 
deliberation - but it is not now too late to atone 
for the Evil that you have done. You can yet give 
the means of a New life to those who through 
your efforts are dead. - You can yet be convinced 
and point out to others the brightness and the 
goodness and the Divinity of Jesus Christ - as 
well as the errors of his preceders, as well as the 
slight earthly weaknesses of himself - God grant 
that you may do this - in doing so you will 
find your inward convictions altered, and then 
from the workings of His holy Spirit within you 
you will truly have his Image implanted in your 
Soul and the power, and the faith to do the 
teachings of His will.

7549 1849 I have answered your book, not with 
a display of talent [perhaps] equal to your own 
but with human [learning] knowledge of learning 
to a desire to shine in letters - In whatever light 
it may be taken or however recieved it is solely 
the Truth and in answer to your last question I 
will again give you though briefly the same 
Answer.

7550 1850   True religion and the only True religion 
is Contained in the New Testament - given by God to 
Man for his instruction and Enlightenment to the 
good of the World.

7551 1851  True religion is a belief in the Divinity
Priests

     Neither are we surprised that the Officials of the Churches 
should so far forget the proper ministerial character as to imagine 
that they stood nearer to God than their fellow [men] worshipers. 
and to liken themselves or permit themselves to be likened by their 
brethren to their Priests whom they had seen at Heathen Altars 
or in the Jewish Temple offering sacrifice, and interceding on behalf 
of the Common people, antient indeed is this notion embodied 
in [this] institutions of a human mediation visibly acting with 
God for many. -
     But the True and only mediation between Man as 
Man, and God as God. in the worship which the only God. 
recieves from sinning man was already exhibited in "The 
Great Hight Priest' of the Human Race. The Apostles trusted 
Him, and they preached Him as the only Sacrificer, the only 
advocate., but when the Apostles fell asleep, there were men 
whose coming they had foretold, who instead of preaching 
Christ assumed his office, established a fearful mimicry 
of his awful work, and professedly became to the people 
that which it is not possible for any but Jesus Christ, to 
be and so it continues to this day.
                                         Electic Review 1857 1/232

"The Church Unions of the Kingdom are forward in 
manifesting their zeal for Clerical power; and in demonstrating 
to the Common sense of the Nation, the necessity of strengthening 
rather than otherwise, the restraints under which it is held 
It is painfully illustrative of the Low morality of the Clergy 
that while they fiercely contend about their orders - they 
are silent as the grave, respecting Ecclesiastical Enormities
recently brought to Light - priestism is surely [on its 
last legs] in its last Stage when it babbles furiously about 
"mint, anise & cummin' but is indifferent to the weightier 
Matter of the Law
                                                                       Ibid 2/648.
42
and the Death of Christ for the Good of Man Kind
and a faith in the mercy & justice of God through
the merits of that [?] for the reward beyond
all price for following in his footsteps - and this
true religion brings with it goodwill & Charity
towards all mankind - You are able to give unto
them what you feel and know God has in 
store for you - Love and Justice - This is
The Truth.

1852
7552  It is sufficiently simple for the most
ignorant to follow and sufficiently great for the
most learned to find study in, and as generation 
succeeds generation this fine religion will become  [*?*]
developd so that at the last [when] are the created
world shall dissolve - those remaining on it
shall be of one faith - that Truth will be beyond
Knowledge - yet nevertheless sure - and at the 2nd
coming of the Son of Man He will find Unity
peace and concord reigning upon Earth. And
that through the Sacrfice which he in the first
made for man - All then will have their reward
And may the Almighty Godin his love for
His own Creation - this undying love for his 
blessed Son - I am the first generation of Mankind
and bless them with Immortal happiness though
his Merits and the last generation through
their own goodness. - And in the many mansions
of our Fathers house may your repentant
sinner find an everlasting  home.

the Seventh Sphere

7571  It is

               Invoked the C.A
The C A is here and theres some reading coming

1869
7581  I am much gratified to find that
you have procured such excellent glasses

May I ask &c

1870
7581  I will answer them

I read my intended Title & quotations

1871
7582  You did will on selecting it
None would be more appropriate

I read G R's preface

1872
7583  I wish you would make the preface
yourself but I would give you one hint
In using the word Christianity it
would seem to many of your readers
to imply the religion of the present
church.
The [?] say that they perceive
the dawning of a faith greater and
more humane. than any now
established
Let the dawning of that Faith be
47

in your book, not in his 
ay that you believe that Faith to 
unite the humanity of Earth with the 
Trust and the Glory of Heaven.

I read G R's last leaf or Summary

7584 1873 I think it would be best that you 
should close it with a few words.

I will do so next Tuesday Evening for your appl.

7585 1874 Do so have you read it through 
since it has been altogether.

I explained

7586 187 That was my reason for mentioning it 
I tried to avoid as much as possible 
any allusion to Spiritualism

As there will be no name or initials - I presume 
there will be no objection to dating it C. -

7587 1876 There would not 
You will let your publisher know 
your name I think it is desirable 
so that if the author should wish 
for any thing further he might 
receive it.

I thought of writing to Mr Chapman. to publish 
it, and place bout a [?] - or less if possible

7588 1877 I agree with You as to publishing it 
at the same place.

I explained

7589 1888 I do not wish you to lose any thing 
by publishing this Book. 
I know that, it is kind of you but 
still there are other Considerations 
when you have spoken to the publisher 
will you communicate it to me -
48

As to dedicating it to Robert Owen

7590 1889 I would not dedicate it to him but 
I would certainly send him a copy

[?] thanks 
It is now close upon September., and the At Spirit 
of my friend Mr Dresser has been confined to 
my box mirror & has not annoyed me but once 
since, may I ask if I shall now be freed 
from his apparition - & can I communicate with 
Mr Dresser again

7591 1890 You will, no further annoyance, 
will be given you in this way through 
him - still I think it advisable 
that you should not recommence 
either a correspondence or an acquante. 
with Mr Dresser upon these subjects

have I your permission to write to him & explain 
the circumstances to him

7592 1891 Certainly you have I would not under 
any circumstances have you act 
otherwise than courtesy dictates

Can we see Mr Anderson at a future evening

7593 1892 You can

Can we also see Count Cagliostro -

7594 1893 He is at rest now and cannot 
appear again

He informed me he would give me the history of 
his life, can I receive that on some future 
evening in this or one of my other mirrors or crystals

7595 1894 In a short time I will tell you 
next Tuesday the exact time.

May I ask if you are aware of the existence 
of the Book of Enoch, which I was occasioned to 
much discussion amongst Theologians & they
49

May I ask your views of that book & the date when 
it was written

1895   7596  It was written at the time of Enoch 
[and] but not by him

If at a future time I make some extracts from it 
will you favor me with your opinion

1896   7597   I will

As to the vision ☨

1897   7598   I will give it you in the other mirror
on another evening

Can you tell me if Miss Andrews has commenced 
calling

1898   7599   I do not know

The other Ev'g Mrs. Cale who has been dead only 
3 years informed us she was in the 7th Sphere. 
is it possible she can have so speedily attained 
that.

1899   7600    She has just entered the 7th Sphere 
but it takes a greater length of time 
to pass from the lower to the upper 
part of the 7th Sphere than it does 
from the 1st to the 6th.

Are the 7 spheres between the orbits of [Earth symbol] & ♂︎
or do they extend into space

1900   7601   The planets and the Stars are in the 
Spheres they pass up beyond light 
of Moon or Stars
When I was called this Evening I 
was further beyond the Sun than 
the Sun is beyond the Earth

Have the other planets as ♃ and ♂︎ Spheres where 
their inhabitants - dwell after death.

1901  7602   No they have not. The inhabitants
50
of other world are unlike those of
the earth in every respect.

May we at some future time see the likeness
of the inhabitants of ♃ and♂︎

1902  
7603  I can do so
Some are mortal but not immortal
Some spiritual but have no souls

Dr Whenell & Sir David Brewster, have both
written works upon the subject of more worlds
than one  I will buy the works & then request
your opinions

1903
7604  I will answer them

I am not this evening prepared with any quest.ns
and I am afraid of asking you questions twice
over.

1904
7605  If I have answered your question
before and it seems unnecessary for
me to answer it again   I can always
mention it

If any advice &c

1905
7606  If you lend Mr Cale a Glass bottle
for [?], for his use,  I should like
you to use it yourself first to get his
G S. to appear.

I will next Tuesday Evening

1906
7607  do so

If any further advice

1907
7608  I have not

The C A left  9 PM.
51

9h.5' PM Called Mr Anderson

Now heres someone Coming, it is him, he is so 
Altered   he has his Crystal in his hand. he looks 
so tall and thin no hat on, & his hair quite 
straight

Good Evening Mr Anderson we rejoice to see you again 
alive, tho not quite so well as we could wish 
he has looked at you a minute & turned his head away

7609   I am pleased to see you again

he has got hold of his Crystal and looks down at it 
I explained the Cause of my Calling him.

7610   I am again before Sebastopol, 
I have been ill, I wish that I was 
dead, I have got my Crystal here 
I have seen you in it several times 
I have seen your guardian Spirit in 
it.   I have seen my own, he has 
told me very painful things, not only 
to me but to the whole Company could 
they be brought to believe it 
I use this Crystal as a relief after 
my work., I see so much death 
so much mortality, that I return 
with relief to that. which gives me 
a knowledge of Spirits and a hope 
and faith in immortality

7611   I was told that there are those now 
in the English Cabinet the private friends 
of Russia who are determined not only 
to make a peace - dishonorable to the 
English nation  but to make it at the 
Cost of their own men, that orders 
will be given to the Commanders on the
52

Crimea to stop their operations when 
they have all but seized Sebastopol 
that at the same time information 
will be sent to the Russian Commanders 
that they may take advantage of our 
position and either remove their army 
safely by a way that will be pointed 
out to them or else have the greatest 
chance of gaining a victory should a 
battle ensue.

May I ask what date it is now with you

7612   The 16th August 
I cannot stay long this Evening

have you heard of the Total destruction of Linsborg

7613 Yes 
I will appear next Tuesday Evening

1/2 past 9 PM.  hes gone.

♂︎die 28th Aug. 1855    CA Mirror
5' to 8.       Invoked the CA
immediately hes' here.

I have reperused the MS. & wish to make a few 
alterations

1908  7614   do so, It was my intention at first 
to give you a skeleton of a book 
which you might clothe in Language 
you thought best suited to meet 
opposition
     I should be pleased at your making 
any alteration

I read the altered passages

1909   7615   They are quite right
They are what I ought to have given
53
I spoke from personal knowledge
instead of what should be general
feeling
I think it would be best if you could
do so to make the preface, there
must be some difference in your
introduction and mine but still if
you would rather that I should
do it I would appear on Friday
night for that purpose. I am quite
willing to do so — I can appear on
Friday.
I thank you. If I call Osmo into this OB
will it be c[onve]nient for him to appear.
1910
7616
He will appear in it this Evening
May I give you a word of advice
unasked.
I explained
1911
7617
The greatest drawback and I find
it in nearly all when they begin to
hold communion with Spirits is their
haste in Desiring to have some
special manifestation of their power
they want some proof given. that
this spirit in communion with them
could only give by making them at
once sensible of a Spiritual presence
but to attain any degree of
perfection in the communion with Spirits
the greatest patience + perseverance is
necessary.
If you do not at first feel Confidence
in the Superiority and Knowledge. of
the Spirit you call , if you greatly
54

Want that knowledge will assuredly 
come, but never by other than those 
means used in the beginning
     No good spirit will ever 
communicate with Man other than by 
his intellectual faculties
     In asking as others beside 
Mr Cale have done for a decided proof 
of the Spiritual presence and Superior 
Knowledge of a Spirit they do themselves 
harm, were they to give such a proof 
it would Clearly prove to those well 
versed in Spirit calling, that they were 
decidedly and undeniably Evil, and 
more I do not think man himself 
after having recieved this proof could 
possibly be so well satisfied of the 
Intelligence and the goodness of the 
Spirit as though he were gradually 
made Confident in him by the intelligence 
and consistent truthfulness of his 
Communications and the Clearness and 
pureness of his doctrines.
     I think that you must feel the 
Same had I given you or Earl Stanhope 
the first time I appeared a proof 
of my power  you would not now 
have felt the Confidence in me, you do 
having told you so often my Opinion

I explained

1912   7618   It is desirable it is necessary that a 
Complete Confidence should exist 
between those seeking the Knowledge 
and those seeing, a strong feeling of
55
of Truth and of interest must exist and
[therefore] therefore it is absolutely necessary 
that in seeking a seer those only sh'd
be chosen who can do it through Love and
interest not payment and servitude

May I again ask if the names of Spirits as
given to us have any spiritual signification - as
Ormu, Osmond, Osmo, Octavius, or if like Hebrew
proper names they have a certain meaning - are
Spirits as low.   Harnder  Hirschiel & others known
by those names in the Spirit World, or are they
only assumed upon their entering into Communion
& intercourse with man.

1913
7619   All Spirits are named from the 
highest to the lowest, they are known
to each other by those names, When
Inquring for a spirit to find him, You
must know his name, this is easily
done, I can scarcely explain to you
the Spiritual meaning of communicating 
with each other. but I can give you
a slight idea of how the names of all
Spirits are known to each other  
     There are a stated number of Spiritual
Sounds - that is not Sounds as heard 
by Man with the Ears, but distinctions

/ Now the C A. looks at you as tho puzzled /

1914 
7620  of peculiar actions, These actions
have so many vibrations, answered
different and Each vibration is a set
of names in some way corresponding 
     You have again to go through these
and you can distinguish the Spirit
56

You want by the stoppage of the 
sound if I may so call it at the 
particular name

The formation of the name tells you 
were they belong - when they have 
risen to that state, their merits in so 
doing and their means of Communicatn. 
with other Spirits at al times, you 
can then find them

You once informed me that many Spirits were 
known by such names as Evans Constantine 
[Osmond?], Mohamed Ali - & others may I ask 
how they [desired?] those names.

7621 1915 Those names belong to deceased mortals 
those given by spirits or angels never 
embodied are the same to themselves 
as to man that is of the same 
meaning

I have Commented with Joseph 
Balsamo and he has informed me 
that he is willing to place before you 
accounts of him existing upon earth 
any time after the beginning of October

Mohamed Ali will appear at 
any time not interfering with his 
peculiar views and feelings on religion

As Mohamed Alis' peculiar views are necessarily 
unknown to me I must request him to fix 
the times, most agreeable to him.

1916 7622 He will never appear to you from 
Sunset on Wednesday till Sunrise 
on Saturday.

I can then call him without interfering with 
your more valued visits should I call him
57
in any Oval mirror

1917
7623  Yes.
he has very peculiar and very firm
views on some religious points they
have kept him back,  when he might
have risen, they are wrong but they
proceed from ignorance of the right
not from any thing ill, I can 
recommend him to you in confidence
of his sincerity and truth.

I ret Thanks

Now he's come in white, no wings, rather short
hair parted down the Middle, coming down just
below the ears and [burns?] under.  light brown
hair - girdle and stones round the collar or
neckband of his dress, rather thin face & no
whiskers
Will you [?] &c

7624  A I A

I explained my motive in Calling & asked if he
would appear in the OB.  until Mr Cale obtained
a Crystal.

7625  This one is good for it
I am willing to appear to any that
can see me.

As Mrs Cale is very nervous, will you kindly
endeavor to develop her faculty of seeing

7626  I will appear as plain as I 
possibly can.
I can do no more.  
53

Do you wish to be called at any particular time

7627 I prefer Tuesdays at 8 o Clock.

When the sitting is over how had he best dispose 
of the Water.

7628 It does not signify what you do with 
the water when the spirits have 
disappeared

Would a hazel rod held in her hand assist her

7629 No.

What are your duties in relation to Mr Cale as his GS.

7630 They are many and various, they all 
tend to his benefit

do you hold the same views of the N.T. as my GS.

7631 I have but one belief, it arises from 
Knowledge, through Jesus Christ 
and through his intercession alone are 
mankind redeemed

Have you any advice that I may give fr you to Mr C.

7632 He must use the same form as you 
do. I have no advice

Now he's going 

Will you request Mr Anderson to appear.

7633 It is too late for him to appear to 
Night.

Called Mr Anderson

Now he's Come, he's dressed in blue Military Coat 
buttoned up tight and belt round, stripes down

Osmo sd. it was too late for you to appear but I 
ventured to call you - what did I tell you when 
I appeared in your Crystal

7635 You very Civilly answered all my 
questions - do you intend inspecting 
on Tuesday Evening

Yes if it is agreeable to my Seer

7636 I think I had better appear then 
& stay longer as it is now so late

he turned round on his heel and was out of sight in a 
moment. - 5'

[?]die Sept. 1855

Invoked the CA.

I mentioned how unwell I had been & was & asked 
If I should try Homeopathy or go to Dr Elliotson

1918 7637 Dr Elliotson I have desired you to go 
there before I think it still more 
desirable now

I trust you will soon be restored to health

1919 7639 I will make one remark before leaving 
which it is unnecessary you should 
trouble to take down.

1920 7639 You have many time spoken to me of 
the bad vision of Mr Leas Wife, I am 
certain that it will never get any 
better and I think that through being 
often called and no one present being 
able to see and from several other 
things Connected with it, the spirits 
that would have otherwise appeared 
have forsaken his mirror, I am
60
unwilling that any chance should go
by of aiding any one who would
seek Communication by this means
therefore I would willingly appear
myself again in his mirror to ans.r
any questions that he might wish
and also to give his niece the Chance
of Seeing --
     After this I think all will have
been done that can aid him, and
therefore I do not wish you to invoke
any spirits at all at his house, I do
not wish you to mix yourself at all
with him in Spiritual Affairs.

I explained that our many years friendship had
induced me to do all I could to aid him in these
matters.

1921
7640  Yes, but after this I hope you will
not again invoke for him.

I returned thanks
If any &c

1922
7641  I have not this evening
I will if you wish it give you the
preface next Tuesday, It is not at all
desirable that you should study when
you are so unwell.

extremely slow. & some reading came here and vanished
again immediately -- the CA still standing there.

I went on Sunday to Dr Elliotson but found he would
not be at home for 3 weeks.— I will go when he returns

1923  
7642
do so, I am anxious that you should
have his advice

As to the letter received from Miss [Andrews?]
1924
7643
If she uses the discharge for Spirits
She would Clear it of all that have
hitherto appeared
She had best then call her own guard'n
Spirit and on his appearance strongly
exorcise him she can then get his
promise that nothing Evil shall appear
being able to see herself calling for
her GS. will be sufficient strongly
desiring to see him without using
any name.

As to GR's preface & the review which I read.
1925
7644
The publication of a book entitled
"What is Faith. has called forth
the attention o a deeply anxious &
enquiring mind — The author of the
following pages is is Convinced that the
[d???ing] faith is a greater or more
stable religion than that founded on
Nature or relied on by the Church
(a)
Feeling of deep regret for the misery
of those who are led by GR to believe
as he believes for misery indeed
must it be when even hope of obtaining
happiness is denied—and a faith
62
beyond knowledge, but in the hands
of God the weakest endeavors are
successful where Truth & Sincerity
are the only motives, has induced me
to become an. Author that would havE
otherwise remained obscure.

May I ask the Cause of the responses coming so slow
7645 1926 No answer.

As to going to Mr Lea's on Friday
1927 7646 I am willing to appear in his mirror
It is my wish to do so, once more
I am anxious to do this for the reason
that the spirits which Mr Lea [show]
desires should appear, perhaps without
your knowledge will when you are
invoking others in his mirror appear
there is no one there sufficiently well
Able to see their appearance, or to read
what they may say — They are able
to follow you and mix themselves with
the visions that appear[s] in your
Mirrors + Crystals —
It is almost needless for me to
say that this must be avoided, to do
so you must after my appearance in
his mirror givE up all spiritual
investigation with him
I know of something connected
with Mr Lea and spiritual investigating
that makes me afraid unless he can
procure some one who can plainly
distinguish the visions that do appear
in his Mirror when Called or Else
givE ovEr invocating any other than
Mr Ormerod & Mr Moseley
63
his Guardian Spirit - that Guardian
Spirit will leave him, and instead of 
having a good one he will have one
decidedly Evil
     Knowing him as you do  so well do
you think that I should tell him when 
I appear that I know this to be the 
case.

I explained

1928   7647   I did not mean that he would willingly 
harm others, but he will harm himself 
As I know that he uses his Mirror
to say the least very indiscreetly, I
shall tell him that he must only use 
it to obtain knowledge of Truth and
good

If any

♂︎die  18th Sept. 1855    C. A Mirror
8PM                   Invoked the C A.
Mr H E Ormerod and friend have done me the favor of 
being present  this evening, as investigators of 
this recondite subject it is desirable they should 
be placed at the outset in the one coveted path
that of truth,  may I ask some questions in
their behalve.

1930   7649   I will answer them. 

Will Mr. H.E.O. be able to see in the Crystal, or
if he has the faculty latent will he be able 
to develop it 

1931   7950   His friend present will be able to 
see   /              see but not himself.
64

May I ask the name of Mr. O's Gaurdian 
Spirit

7657 1932 Castoria

of what order or sphere

7652 1933 He is a spirit of the sun

was Castoria ever embodied or has he 
dwelt on this earth.

7653 1934 He has not

Will Castoria be pleased to appear this 
evening

7634 1935 He will

Will you please to inform me the name
of Mr. M Morely's Gaurdian Spirit

7655 1936 I will enquire

When will you give me his name

7656 1937 Next Tuesday evening

Will Mr. M. be both able to call and see also

7657 1938 He will

As in the reply to "What is truth" I 
have stated my opinion that the same 
faith cannot be given to the old as to the 
New Testement may I at some future 
evening ask your views of those books seriatim

7658 1939 I have several times given my 
opinion upon the whole 
I think it unnecessary to [?] 
it individually.

I will then place my question another 
way, the 4 books written by the evangelists 
containing the actual words of our Saviour 
altho' written by unlearned men, yet those 
men were the immediate conpanions 
and disciples of our Lord and their writings 
are therefore to be received unreservedly
65

as inspired writings - but a great portion 
of the new Testement consists of the writings 
of St Paul who was not only a Jew deeply 
versed in [blank] Learning but also strongly 
imbued with the platonic philosophy 
of his time, and consequently differ in 
many points from the doctrines given 
in the gospels - now as in all human 
probabily Paul never even saw Jesus in 
the flesh, are his writings and the 
doctrines contained therein to be 
recieved as equally inspired and equally 
authentic with the gospels.

1940 7659 They are not

Jesus Christ above is the founder 
of the divine religion none 
others are entirely pure and 
true.

Your answer gives me reason for asking 
your views of the Canonical Books of the Old 
Testement individually because when 
we take the book of the Law as given by 
Moses and find in it so many things 
utterly repugnent to our feelings - and 
to our ideas of the God of purity and 
truth, so opposed to the doctrine taught 
in the new Testement we are led to 
doubt its divine inspiration the more 
so and indeed chiefly - because we 
find that the Law which is given with 
such singular minuteness even upon 
repulsive subjects - by Moses can be traced 
from what we know Zabaism or Sabianism 
to be merely rites and ceremonys as
66

nearly as possible opposed to the rites and 
ceremonies of the idolatrous nations 
around them - so that we may pretty 
clearly ascertain the formula of Zabiasm 
by a [contraiely?] to those found in the 
Law of moses, thus giving a reason 
for presuming the Law was a human 
not a divine code.

1941 7660 There is no part of the Old 
Testament written under 
divine inspiration 
some part was written by 
Prophets and wise men, 
but not even the Law which 
Moses lays down was recieved 
from God.

May I ask if you then can tell me why, 
Roman and Protestant Catholic priests 
should so strenuously believe the Plenary 
Inspiration of the old Testement when 
the Jewish priests reverance their Mislina 
German or Talmud more highly than 
even the Old Testement.

1942 7661 Men will not [evestigate?] Religion 
in the same manner as they 
do other subjects. If they receive 
one communication it is not 
because they have dissected 
it and find that they can 
believe in every part, but 
they receive the whole as 
a belief - when in truth they 
have only faith in some 
part. 
1943     
It is so with the bible, men educated to believe in that book at all and especially those whose education is to become a profession take it unreservedly and entirely, and believe that if one part is removed one stone misplaced the whole [?] of their Faith [?] fall.
W,, O, Is it wrong or sinful under any circumstance to compel a mirror or Crystal for information for solely good purposes. 
1944
There is not
No harm can come of that where Arrily towards man is untended and obedience to Almighty God as the only giver of all good is sincerely acknowledged.
W,, O, should I do well apply for help when in religious difficulties on point of faith.
1945
When he has had with [?] I and feels a reliance on him it would be well that he should trust him with all his troubles and misgivings in all religious subjects. He will be aided by his guardian [?] through doing this, in his researches after religious

66

Truth

FH, May I here ask if Hunder had continued 
my GS I should have recieved 
the same views of Christianity as I have 
through your being my GS.

1946 7665 He would have either done 
so or pointed out to you the 
means of obtaining conviction 
other than by his means.

Mr. O. Has the G S you mention always 
been my G S.

1947 7666 He has, if you desire it he 
will appear himself this 
evening or any other evening 
he will be able to tell you 
more of himself than I should

Mr. O, Is a persons G S always devoted 
to his best interests

1948 7667 Spiritualy the intersts of 
the man are the interests 
of the G S, for after the death 
of the mortal, the Gaurdian 
Spirit and the soul make 
the immortal body, 
therefore it is his sold object 
to procure for that mortal 
happiness hereafter 
He also desires that happiness 
and goodness should reside 
with his charge on earth, 
to obtain this he watches and 
prays, and gives him if he 
cannot do so by outward 
directions, by inward conviction
69

and the promtings of his heart his 
advice and counsel.

W. O, Am I right in supposing from 
what you have told me that the 
suggestions of conscience correspond 
with the inward advice of our GP.

1949 7668 It does

The innate sense of right and 
wrong which man in every 
capacity and under every 
circumstance feels, may be 
relied on, and if he acts only 
from his innate sense of right 
and truth, then he fulfills 
the wishes the desires, the 
promtings of his GP.

Mr. W. M, - A lady friend of Mr Moselys 
having inspected an unconscerated 
crystal belonging to him, has been ever 
since much annoyed by noises and 
rappings, can you tell him how to 
remedy it.

1950 7669 The Crystal must be discharged 
strongly discharged.

If Mr. M. lets me have the crystal shall 
I discharge it, and will you give me a 
Talisman for her to wear.

1951 7670 I will do both, I will discharge 
the crystal, and if she is 
desirous that the sounds 
cease, I will send her a form 
by which she can dismiss them

Mr. O. Are the spirits who disturb her good 
or evil.
70

1952
7671  Rapping is caused solely by
evil spirits or by those wandering
upon the earth.

She imagines it is caused by a person
who had magnetized her, was she under
his influence.

1953
7672  She was not if that person was
still living.

Mr. Mosely has unfortunately left his
crystal, in the hands of a very young
person, and he is afraid now that some
harm may arise to her, can you inform
me how to prevent it.

1954
7673  In investigating these subjects
the greatest caution should 
be taken.  no good can ever
from any crystal, or from
any mode of communication 
with spirits where man only 
relies upon himself and
the spirit he has to deal with
He must first consecrate it,
and then faith and trust
must be put in the Almighty
that no evil should come 
of it.

If Mr. Mosely this evening when alone
repeats earnestly the discharge will
that dispel them.

1955
7674  That may prevent harm from
happening, but it is not
sufficient to prevent visions

Mr. Moseley wishes to ask to what end
are these spiritual manifestations.
71

premitted now so universally to develop 
themselves upon earth.

1956 7675 I can only refer you to the 
new Testement, it there 
says that in the latter days 
before the one God shall be 
worshipped with his son and 
the Holy Ghost, great wonders 
shall arise, before the fallen 
angel is in bondage for a 
thousand years, he would 
seem to have greater power, 
and I trust as I am certain 
that this manifestation so 
universally of his power is 
only the last spark of his 
expiring greatness.

Many of these spirits appear to preach the 
doctrine and divinity of Christ ([?] Mr. 
Harris) can these be the doctrines of evil 
spirits, or are some good and some evil

1957 7676 There are none good, the means 
which are used to make man 
evil, are not those always 
which seem to him the 
worst, and by leading him 
on to believe in his own 
goodness, he makes him 
worse than he would other 
wise have been.

Many of the Spirits who comunicate 
with Mr. Harris, preach the fall of man 
and [?] Salvation through Jesus 
Christ - what spirits are these.
72

1958   7677  They are there who would afterward
preach of their own power to 
do that which they begin 
by asserting God alone can
do.

We were here debating the subject amongst
ourselves when there appeared in the 
mirror 

1959   7678  I think that you misunderstand
me, I mean that those are
unlively evil spirits who communicate
by material means  those 
who make man sensible thr'u
his corporeal faculties of thier 
presence, shore who appear to 
him and communicate with 
him and only convince him
through his mind and his 
intellect, those are good and
truthful,

I returned thanks,

1960   7679  Should Mr. Ormerod be
to again attend I should be
pleased to communicate with 
him on any subject that 
he may desire,  his friends

that are really existing in other parts 
at the same time

For his power over other men Mes'm. 
explains it, by this and something 
yet more simple Electro-Biology he 
influences mens mind, and makes 
those who enter into his system and 
place themselves under his Tutelage 
he makes them the means of obtaining 
his dishonest [Circlihood?]

Mr O. remarks that the Baron draws Magic Circles 
on the Earth. in different Colored Chalks. & Mr O 
wishes to know if he does this according to art, or merely 
to delude his pupils

[*1968 7694*] Circle magic is a very powerful means 
of detaining spirits when called 
for this purpose it is sometimes used 
by him, but the forms & figures which 
he sometimes makes use of are only 
a means of blinding those around 
him were one really present who 
understood the whole of magic by 
circle work they would easily detect 
his own ignorance of what he uses

As to calling the Barons A S. at some future 
time

[*7695 1969*] He will appear

Mr O. Is there any truth in the popular notion of 
the Devil, that is as a Superior Evil ruler over 
all other Evil Spirits

[*7696 1970*] There is an Evil power Existing the 
Antagonist of good, this Evil power is 
caused by the Fallen Angel 
There is not one Superior to the rest
77

Mr O. is there any truth in the popular belief, that
a mortal can bargain & sell his Soul to the Devil

1971  7697   Man may become so evil that even
while on earth, he is the same as Evil
Spirits and being the same he has the 
same power
     But there is no sin that cannot be
retrieved, the fallen Angel has not the
power to take away that which the 
Sole Almighty can give
     Allowing that he could do so it w'd
be giving to him greater power than
Man gives to God, because however
Evil man may become,  how perfectly
reckless and abandoned it is possible
for him to become, the Almighty has
the power to redeem him to Send
in his Mercy, his all pervading
Influence, His Holy Spirit, into
that Evil Mans heart that he might
become repentant and Live

If any advice &c.

1972  7698    I am very desirous that Mr Ormerod
should continue to investigate the
Mystery of these Subjects, being
certain that he denies only Truth
I feel certain that in Time these
Subjects will be so fully developd
to him that they will do him and 
through him, others great  & lasting

of his own Guardian Spirit, it would be
well that he, Mr Ormerod , should
invoke  his GS. or any other that he
might desire   in one of your mirrors
I am perfectly certain that his
doing this he could not get mixed up
with any thing that is Evil, which
he might do were he to begin by using
a mirror or Crystal, the purport of 
whose previous use had been doubtful
     If Mr Ormerod wishes to invoke
his GS or other spirits here, it would
be best to devote any Friday Evening
for that purpose
     He can then put his own questions
and receive replies direct from them
I shall be very pleased to fall in with your suggestions
If agreeable to Mr O & my Seer

[*7699*] [*1973*] It is agreeable to all.

♀ die 28th Sept 1855, at Mr Lea's Limehouse
                                Lero's Mirror
7h.15            Invoked the C.A.
Agreeable to your kind permission we are now at
my friend Mr Lea's and I have called you in
this mirror dedicated to Lero. May I ask you
the questions he has prepared, or shall he ask
them himself
7712   1974 He had best ask them himself
Mr Lea took hold of my Seers hand & asked the 
following questions
Is there any means by which I could become a
Seer, if so and it is not unlawful in the eyes of
the Almighty - I earnestly wish to do so
1975   7713   All man'd can hold communion with
spirits - but seeing them depends
upon the brain being able to receive an
immense amount of Electricity, there
are few who have this power sufficient
to understand it,  You have it not -
that cannot be developed which is
not latent in you - you will never
see any thing, that is not visible
to the outward Eye.
Can you give me any instructions to know when a
person has the faculty of Seeing, so that I
Crystal Gems by
then temperment & Combine
[*81*]

might not uselessly call any good Spirit when there is 
no one to see them

[*1976 7714*] You can tell it by a persons temperament & if 
you are apply [cognoms?] by their countenance

[D Lea] Is it possible for me to strengthen my will so as to 
be able to surmount the difficulties, but here to I fear 
I have been too impatient & anxious.

[*1977 7715*] To surmount the difficulties that must 
attend Spiritualism to man on Earth. 
It is necessary to have a firm free will 
a firm reliance - and a persevering Courage 
with the unknown & mysterious bodies 
that you put yourself in Contact with 
No blind reliance on their power but a 
desire of Conviction of their Truth. of 
their goodness & their purity, through 
the greatest of mans blessing his 
reason and his intellect -

[D Lea] Is my Call sufficiently powerful or adapted 
for the purpose.

[*1978 7716*] The form of invocating that is used 
for myself is the best, none is good 
unless it calls upon the Spirit appearing 
in the name of the most High.

[D Lea] Is there any peculiar Efficacy in sitting due North 
& South when Invocating

[*1979 7717*] There is not, a moments reflection and 
it must seem to you, to be only made 
by those who wish to Envelop those 
magical formulas in mystery 
Time or Space habitation or position 
is nothing to the Spirit world from 
the Highest to the Lowest [who] have 
a seer's face buried in the ground I
[*82*]

I could appear perfectly as plain 
did I so desire it as in this mirror

If Mr Leas Niece [Matilda?] Might - places her hand 
in my Seers, will to inform me if she possesses 
the faculty of seeing - or has the faculty latent 
and capable of being developed

[*1980 7718*] I will remain while she inspects it 
I will also appear plainer than I 
otherwise do

Miss Might took hold of my Seer Miss Leigh's hand 
The C A became too dazzlingly luminous for 
Emma to look at steadily - the C A was in his 
purple Robes and it appeared to sweep in such 
immense folds that it appeared almost black 
& his Crown flashed with light, It looked like 
a pile of Gold Balls polished beautifully. - the 
Stones in the front of the robe - are as large as 
[oval drawing] - & when I asked if Miss Might would 
be able to See if she inspected a Crystal 
or ORB first the CA said

[*1981 7719*] She will never be able to communicate 
with Spirits had she been able to 
do so she would now see a very great 
change in the Mirror

Can it be ascertained if her Sister Elizabeth can 
See - without her being present

[*1982 7720*] It cannot

Now the C.As getting smaller

I explained how anxious I was that my friend 
Lea who like myself had been so many years 
devoted to Occult Science might obtain a 
Seer requested the CA to advise, the best 
means of Conducting this Enquiry
[*83*]

[*1983 7721*] I am sure that when a man desires 
to become master of these studies and 
cannot do so the interest becomes 
painful - It is also painful to those 
spirits whom he  calls when the 
mind of those desirous to see & commune 
with them are strained to the utmost 
and then he is obliged to leave without 
either having attained the desired object 
I have enquired amongst those At'c 
Spirits who are acquainted with Mrs. 
Lea and I find with regret that there 
seems no possibility of his being able 
amongst any of his present aquaint'es 
to find a Seer

[*1984 7722*] Still I am desirous that all 
those wishing to investigate, that which 
when received in Sincerity I trust, must 
make every man better more happy 
in this world and better prepared for 
the next - should have every means 
of obtaining Communion with Spirits 
I think it would be therefore best 
to confine his Invocations to this 
mirror and in trying to develop any 
persons faculty to call instead of 
his Guardian Spirit or the Spirit 
of any living or deceased person 
first locate Views of any thing 
he may wish such as a desire 
to see any distant place, any thing 
long past or far distant any thing 
known to himself & unknown to the 
person looking - and by this means
[*84*]

he will ascertain their power and at 
the same time furnish himself with a 
source of Interest & pleasure

I explained the difficulty Seers had in first losing 
sight of their own Image in a mirror & asked if 
the Crystal or OB would not be best for the purpose

[*1985 7723*] The mirror would be best for this reason 
When a party looks into a Crystal 
or Bottle of Water, they strain their Eyes 
for the desired object which makes them 
so tired and painful that it is 
impossible for them to inspect it long 
and they leave off just at the time 
that they would be beginning to see, 
Now in looking for Visions of a light 
and amusing Character, persons and 
Especially Ladies do not get tired of 
looking in Mirrors

In seeking to obtain the Visions here ment'd. is it 
desirable to use the Call in full or merely request 
the Spirit of the Mirror to allow a Vision &c

[*7724 1986*] That is sufficient

As to Mr Leas Legacy

[*7725 1987*] Could he buy an annuity with it. 
There are very few if any businesses 
in which money can be Embanked 
other than on Speculation

I think it would be best to ask 
his GS. this question, You can do so 
at your home.

Is it advisable that Mr Lea should be present

[*7726 1988*] It is of no consequence
1989. 
     Every man bears an Alter in his own heart, upon which
wherever he invokes it, in purity enthusiasm & Love. the
Truth of God descends. Conscience is sacred, it is free, But
Truth is one; and Truth may anticipate the time when
from the free conscience of enlightened men, beneath the
Truth of God shall be given forth a religious harmony
more mighty, more potent in Love & life, than any to
which humanity is yet leant Ear. --

“A man really feeling himself the Steward of Gods gifts will
be in a condition to meet the different perplexing questions of our
day honestly, earnestly, hopefully; ready to recieve all hints
respecting the best means of doing that which he is bound to
do, never dreaming that the means which were fittest for one
time must be fittest for any other, or that there is is any sense
in merely following the most admirable precedents.

[*85*]

Myself & Mr Lea were discussing religious Subjects 
when the C.A. said (in the mirror) to Mr Lea

[*1989 7727*] You are anxious upon Religious matters 
Can you be Convinced of Truth. - 
Simple Earnest Truth by other means 
than your own Guardian Spirit will 
you receive with a Mind open to Conviction 
doctrines of Faith opposed to that 
you have before believed in, if you 
can do this, I can offer you a book 
Simple and plain, and yet in it 
is contained the Foundation of a 
Religion, the dawn of a happier 
day than has ever yet risen on 
mankind for in it is Contained the 
Religion preached by Christ, the 
doctrine approved of and sanctioned 
by himself, His Father & the Holy Spirit 
Combined, without priestly Craft 
without hypocrisy, without Idolatrous 
forms & Ceremonies, without any 
obligation of belief - The Heart of 
Man can offer that adoration and 
prayer to his Maker which is only 
acceptable to his sight - Will you 
read the answer to what is Truth 
and Seriously study it - You must 
be convinced that the only object in 
giving it is a desire to set before 
Man, the means of his attaining 
happiness, I have no other object 
in giving it will you do so

The CA's communication having ceased & he leaving our
[*86*]

discussion Emma said here is [?] reading Come

[*1990 7728*] If you believe in Jesus Christ you believe 
in the Godhead - the three persons in 
one God are inseparable - If you believe in 
Almighty God alone as one being, You 
cannot look up to him with a feeling 
of love or reliance upon his charity 
which you can do if you believe that 
he is so far interested in your welfare 
so actively engaged for your Eternal 
happiness that he sends his own 
Spirit part of his own being upon Earth 
to do that for you, to teach you 
immediately those doctrines, which he 
in his Mighty position above all could 
not seem to the mind of man to do 
In sending his Son upon Earth he 
gives man something tangible something 
real to hold to, whereas if he Closed 
himself in Mystery above mans Comprehension 
man could not know him, and feel 
his loving kindness as he would thro' 
the Almighty acting for him by 
being amongst him in his own form 
to minister to his Earthly Wants.

We have commenced our discourse & presently there appeared

[*1991 7729*] Man goes round the Subject he makes 
difficulties where they really do not 
exist - What can be more simple 
than the True Religion - if man 
would Calmly with a Calm mind 
and an Earnest desire or feeling of
[*87*]

Reverence & humility ask of the One 
Almighty God - his God - the Creator 
of the universe for men even in their 
double recognize one being superior 
to the [blank] when looking on the 
commonest things around them 
Pray to him, let your heart pour 
out its feelings - but not in Church 
not before other men - not thro the 
aid of priest - and as that prayer 
rises to your Maker, you will 
feel that you converse with him 
in his Glory, and having prayed to 
him for the aid of His [?] light 
for the promptings of his Holy Spirit 
seek then for wisdom upon earth 
And keeping him in view as the Sole 
object you are trying to obtain make 
those innate faculties within you 
the ones that are nearest to God. that 
make you above all other Creations 
your reason, your intellect, your 
power of Comprehension & your memory 
make these still in Subservience to 
[you] his will - the receptacle for all 
Religious Doctrines and you will 
find even if you glance over Every 
Religion of the Earth. The Idolatrous 
as well as the Civilized Countries, You 
will find that the only religion, the 
only belief that your heart will recieve 
and your innate Conviction of right 
Comprehend will be the redemption
[*88*]

of man through Jesus Christ, his Unity 
with the Father and their Spirit in 
your heart - You will then feel the 
force of the Words of Jesus Christ 
I and my Father are one - He that 
believeth in me shall be saved, You 
will have the Sure and Certain hope 
beyond all Knowledge of a life an 
immortal life of Eternal happiness 
beyond the Grave - You will look 
forward to that Grave as the beginning 
of a life that is indeed beyond mans 
finite Comprehension. [H?]

If any further advice

[*7730 1992*] I have not.

10' to 9 PM.

[?]die 2nd Oct 185. C.A mirror

Invoked the CA

9 PM.

I rel'd thanks for the C.A's appearance at Mr Lea's - & asked if 
I sh'd read the preface

[*7731 1993*] do so

I read it & asked if it met the CA's approval

[*7732 1994*] It does

You mentioned on [?]die that Seers could be told by 
their Temperament & their Physiognomy - as there 
exists so much diversity in Tempt. & Physiognomy in 
those whom I personally know possess the faculty 
may I request your further elucidation

[*7733 1995*] All who have the power of Seeing have 
a similar expression of the Eyes 
By Temperament I meant their Negative 
Electricity
[*89*]

As to a shorter mode of Electro-Biologizing

[*7734 1996*] No Answer

Repeated the question

No Answer

I explained

[*7735 1997*] I understand your question 
I know of that which you ask for but 
I cannot answer it 
I wish that you would make another 
Seal. that I might impregnate it with 
my influence 
Electro Biology is at all times very 
objectionable 
To be able to control a person's mind 
instantly would be even more so.

I gave a further explanation

[*1998 7736*] I do not desire to convince those people 
who without understanding any thing 
strenuously oppose it. 
Were you to Electro Biologize her (Mrs. Clemson) 
she would feel herself under the influence 
of it for a short time, then she would begin 
to doubt it - and she would End by 
being as obstinately incredulous as before 
If you did Convince her no possible 
good could come from it.

As to the method of Crossing Nervous [?] [?] doloreux 
Toothache &c

[*1999 7737*] Mesmerism used solely as a creative 
agent is a great blessing 
Electro-Biology cannot have the same 
effect in curing pain 
I have given you my answer to the same 
question often before - you have desired
90
to serve others when suffering, but I say
that it is not necessary , that it is not
desirous — it is even dangerous that you
should do so.
There are other remedies as Effectual
as those you Could offer to your [?]
and should mesmerism to any extent
be needed there are places, where that
mesmerism can be givEn by those Competent
to do so.
By troubling yourself as you do
so needlessly about others, you worry
and agitate your mind, and make 
yourself anxious and ill in trying to do
others good
I am thankful that I havE at
least the Chance of presenting your
doing Yourself harm for the imaginary good
of others. and being your guardian
I have only the desire of your good
here and hereafter.
As to the Continuation of The Vision
2000
7738
If you desire it you can do s next
Tuesday Evening
I shall have pleasure in Showing it.
AS to speaking to us addressing any one to the vision
2001
7739
do not address it while it is present
You can ask any question after it is gone
May I ask if [?] will appear this [?] if Called
[774?]
2002
She will appear
When I may receive the rest of Balsamos' Life
2003
7741
It is Convenient for you to havE it
Now as soon as you desire to Call it
[*91*]

Will the memoir be placed before us in English

[*7742 2004*] Yes, it would be useless in any other

Can we see Mr Anderson this Evening

[*7743 2005*] You can call him probably he will 
Appear.

Since I last ment'd the Subject of the War, the 
Allies have taken Sebastopol. notwithstanding 
your former responses to which I pay great respect 
& deference, I cannot alter my opinion that this War 
is a Curse entailed upon Mankind by Kings & priests 
[?] of freedom [?] despotism - but of balance 
of Power - It seems to be [inconcernable?] - the - priests of 
each state are Ever ready to hound them on. [Even?] 
[forecast?] in making the Symbol of Peace - "The banner 
under which Madmen assemble to glut the Earth 
with blood" - it has been Estimated that 500,000- 
men have been sacrificed -

[*7744 2006*] Since the Sun last rose a deep gloom 
a sadness we cannot dispell has 
passed over the Spirit world. - 

We have received 10,000 men 
murdered for it is nothing Else with 
the hands of their fellow mortals 
[with the hands of their fellow m]

Although to them, many of them 
who died in Ignorance & Crime, this 
untimely death tho' so frightful is a 
blessing for through the mercy of God 
it saves them from punishment 
from misery that they might otherwise 
have suffered - still it seems very 
very frightful to those, who pure 
in Spirit - Knowing only Love and 
92

7744    Charity, desiring only peace, truth and 
Goodness - and to instil the same 
principles into the heart of man 
It seems to them very frightful that 
men cannot receive the bounties of Creation 
shed alike all over the Earth. without 
warfare and strife -
     That he who begins the quarrel 
in an unjust cause should be defeated 
is necessary to the Strength & Welfare 
of those who would otherwise be peaceable 
but for the aggressor to believe that he 
is fighting for a right and his Enemy 
also to believe the same and to individualy 
call upon the Almighty to aid them 
one against the other is Blasphemy
     But not only this how repulsive 
it is to Almighty God that either when 
they have done the most harm, when 
they have slaughtered the greatest 
number of their Enemies, offer up 
thanksgivings to him, believing that 
he has fought for them. that he 
has strengthened their arm, and 
that his angels have fought in their 
ranks -
     They not only themselves exult in 
their Butchery, their bloodshed of 
thousands of those opposed to them and 
it is the same on [the] either side 
they absolutely thank the Almighty 
for his interposition in their behalf
     Surely man is blind in his 
ignorance - the Church and its whole
93
body of attendant living [?] have
not even the decency to show a Charity
towards mankind which they pretend
to have -- for they not only offend God
by thanking him for his Especial
favor, but rejoice among themselves, they 
dance and feast and ring their bells
when they hear that thousands of 
their Enemies  men have been cut off
at a moments notice from the life
that they enjoy. --

2007
7745  It is in the power of the Almighty
to at once stop this war by a special
providence - but it is not his will to
do so - there is so slight a difference
between the aggressed and the aggressor
that a decided victory on either side
would be unfair, but although he does
not stop it by his especial command
it is no more pleasing in his sight
He allows it, but he does not [?] it --
and allowing it he makes a recompence
to those -  poor people, who suffer by
it without distinction as to what
nation or religion they belong by taking
them to himself
     But will it be the same with those
who began this war and who in
their proud tyranny uphold it now 
one against the other.
     It weighs with a heavy sadness 
upon us. --

1/2 past 9              C A Mirror
                     Invoked Lero
Lero is here as before ( - Ex'd )
Mr Leas wife has unfortunately lost the faculty of 
seeing in the Mirror, do you know the Cause of it

7746   I do
She will never regain it

I regret to hear it, but if as the C.A informs me it is 
a physical property I cannot concieve how she Can 
irretrievably have lost it -

7747    No answer

Are you still the GS of Mr Lea

7748     I am

As to the Legacy.

7749   The sum being too small for him to 
make any certain gain by it at present 
it would be best that he should put 
it in Secure Keeping where a little interest 
would accumulate.
     In all probability his profession 
will give him a good living for many 
years to come, should he live -
      Should that then fail him he 
would be able to have recourse to this 
money - I think it therefore advisable 
that instead of using it in any way 
he should put it in the Bank

Can you give him any advice as to his Spiritual 
Manifestations in his Mirror or Crystal

7750    I cannot 
I will do all I can to aid him

have you any advice you wish me to convey to him

7751   I have not
95

May I ask you to favor me with a Seal for him 
to place ag't his Mirror when Invoking, such 
as he one he C A favored me with

7752   I have no Seal Now.

If I have occasion to call you on my friend's 
behalf at any future time, will you kindly appear

7753    I will

1/4 past 7 PM.
I have made another Telesm.  will you animate 
it according to your kind promise

2008   7754   I will do so if you put it against the 
Glass

The C A placed his hand upon it

2009   7755    It is done.

When will it be Convenient for us to have the continuat'n 
of the Vision

2010   7756    It will appear when I leave.

As very much confusion arises in argument from 
the different latitude given to the meaning of certain 
Terms which ought at the outset to be well 
defined - may I ask you for a definition of your 
View, of the strict meaning of the Words Inspired 
and Inspiration as applied in the Scriptures

2011   7757    When I say men wrote by Inspiration 
I mean under the Sole influence 
and guidance of Almighty God
     Not mans [?] Ideas and 
the Almightys Suggestions combined
96
but man being powerless is the instrument 
by which He speaks or writes

Then every word so written or uttered would be 
Perfect.  Truthful and Divine

2012   7758   If a man is inspired at all it is not 
partially, he is wholly and entirely 
at the time being the Instrument of 
Gods Communion with other men. - 
therefore if he is Inspired at all, that 
[information] inspiration is GOD's and is 
perfect.

7759   But there is another Class 
There are those who act and write under 
Spiritual Influence - this must in no 
way be confounded with Inspiration 
     This is an Influence [over him] with 
man not a power over him and the 
Spiritual suggestions are mixed with 
his own Ideas and formed in his own 
Words and it mixes things which are 
perfectly right with those which coming 
from man alone are Erroneous.
     Now this Influence does not come 
from God but from his attending Angel 
and it is so ordered that man in his 
intercourse with them while he recieves 
their suggestions and their Influence 
does not yield his own reason and 
his own power as he does to Gods.

One is Spiritual Influence the other 
Divine Inspiration

I explained at length, my limited Time had prevented 
my completing my Fair Copy of my MS. & consequently 
the Index - which rendered me liable to ask or rather 
repeat questions which I had before proposed &c

[*2013 7760*] You have, I would not willingly ans'r. 
at greater length any question that you 
have asked, without being satisfied -

If you ask other questions which I 
have before answered in the same way 
as I must do again, then I have always 
& will continue to tell you that I have 
answered them before.

Was alphabetic writing - that is the art of connecting 
and recording [the] Ideas by letters. a Spiritual 
gift or discovered and Invented by man & perfected 
thro' a long series of years - Is there in the 
Spiritual World - sufficient knowledge of the past 
& present actions of Man - to ans'r. that question

[*2014 7767*] There is a Knowledge of all the Concerns 
of Man.

A Knowledge of the Art of Writing is 
proved even by this Appearance but 
it was invented by Man.

It must have began almost in the 
beginning for man naturally desires a 
means of communication with others 
Adam communicated by his fingers, he 
made sounds & with them Gesticulations 
to distinguish one from the other

Having made these figures with his 
hands to denote his sounds he 
represented them by shadows on leaves 
and then [?] them out - and thus 
the first man communicated with his

     The Babylonish Talmudists, with Jerome & Origen [?]
the change in the Hebrew letters to Ezra; but neither in the
Book of Ezra nor in Josephus do we find any mention of
such a transaction --
     It is probable that the most antient books of the old
Testament were originally composed in the old phonician
alphabet of which vestiges have been found in various parts
of Western Asia & Northern Africa & which in some respects
resembled the inscriptions upon the [?] of the Asmonean
Princes --                  J. S.  Porter  principles of Textual

In whatever way we explain the Legend [?]  Ezra after the return
of the Jews from Captivity [?] out the Old Test:  in the Chaldea
Character, its truth cannot be maintained --

[*98*]

descendants - From these leaves figures 
began to be just [born?] & afterwards cut 
from skins and then from [men?] and 
then Stained with Colors.

May I ask if Moses wrote his first 5 Works in 
Characters in some degree resembling the present 
Hebrew or Chaldee.

[*2015 7762*] He did

The Hebrew Language has not undergone 
So many Changes in the generations 
that it has passed through as others

In Genesis 2nd. verses 19 & 20 Moses records that Adam 
named Every beast. of the Field & Every Fowl of the 
Air - and whatsoever he called them that was their 
Name - how Hebrew names signify also their 
peculiarities and this would show a profound 
Knowledge of Language. in Adam Eve he had 
Even a helpmate to speak to.

[*2016 7763*] It is wrong

It shows its Error on the face of it, 
It would be impossible for any man 
at the present time [?Emliged] as he is 
with a Knowledge of Every variation 
of Sounds in the Language to give 
names Successively to as many 
Creatures as there are living upon 
the Earth.

How much less then could Adam 
do it, who had only just been Created 
just awakened to Life - without any 
power any Knowledge, Even of the 
things existing around him

And it could not be the Almighty 
that uttered the names of his creation
[*99*]

through Adam, for why should he 
Ask Adam to do it, himself being 
the only listener. - if Adams words 
were only to be his own will.

Am I then to conclude that some portions of the 
Books of Moses - were already composed, others merely 
oral Traditions handed down during the lengthened 
lives of the Patriarchs - and that Moses collected 
arranged & wrote under Spiritual influence

[*7764 2017*] It is so.

Notwithstanding your kind & Esteemed Communications 
my Knowledge of Spiritualism is indeed as 
nought. - having seen in our mirrors & Crystals not 
only our present Roman print - various autographs 
of individuals - French German. Hebrew and 
Hindoo [?] - may I ask if there exists in the 
Spirit World - a Correct Copy of the Gospels as 
written by the Evangelists - or is there only 
a Spiritual Knowledge

[*2018 7765*] There does - Every spirit has a 
Knowledge of the life of Christ - his 
teachings - his words upon Earth 
and his inspiration over others & 
through them his words again

This is all that is important 
to know and this alone makes the 
Bible a holy book. - it is with that 
as with the City

Jesus Christ was asked whether 
[that?] a whole City would be saved 
if in that City only one believed and he 
said -

For the sake of that one the whole 
shall flourish and for the sake of
[*100*]

of the Sons Life and Counsel is the 
whole book Countenanced by God

May I read to you the first 13 verses of the 
1 John 5 to see if they agree so far as translation 
will admit [do so] with the original

[*7766 2019*] do so

I read them

[*2020 7767*] The sense is the same 
It is a beautiful Chapter and on 
that alone might be founded a 
Religion greater than any ever yet 
recognized by Man.

I have selected these verses because they Contain in 
verse seven. a passage the Originality of which 
has been vehemently disputed so much so that 
a Bishop of the Church of England in his 
Lectures on the Integrity of the New Testament after 
bringing forth all the Arguments which his great 
learning & [attainments?] enabled him to do, says 
If that verse is genuine all his Arguments fall 
to the ground. - may I ask if these words 
are the Genuine or an interpolation accidental 
or otherwise -

"For there are those that bear record in 
Heaven, The Father, the Word and The Holy Ghost, 
and then three are one - "

[*2021 7763*] In the Original it was The Father 
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

I may then consider the Verse Virtually Correct

[*7764 2022*] It is

May I ask your View of the Quotations from 
the Old Testament which appear in the New 
the great Body of Christians arguing from that 
existence in the New Testament. - that they are alone

In many places where parts of the

it existed without knowing all the
Doctrines that it contained.

as a marginal note is put
"as written by the Prophet Isaiah".

I intend the first spare time I can get, to write 
to him upon the Subject - to soothe his over excited 
passion for these Subjects - Can you give me any

be given, will be given him by his

did he struggle with it he might in

                  The Vision Continued

7777
Now there seems like water coming - yes its all water 
I see it more, I dont see the surface I look thro' 
it as as tho it filled the whole mirror - I appear to see a 
great way, It was rather thick, now is getting clearer 
Now I can see the bottom., sand pebbles shells 
Now the water beautifully clear, theres little long 
specs all [falling] - colours darting about; they 
appear to dart up and down & right across as fast 
as possible they dont look alive they are like 
specks of Colored sand darting about, some yellow 
violet, pink, green, grey - .
     Now a few of the pink ones have come 
together in the middle and make one large one 
some more pink ones come round it, making 
it larger now all the pink ones are are there. it seems 
to draw all the pink ones from amongst the 
Rest,
     Now the Green ones are going round 
the Pink, outside the pink, they dont mix but 
cover the pink all round, like a coating all over 
All the green ones are gone to it - & surround it.
     Now the Grey Specs are going - now 
all the Grey Specs are going they are all round
     Now the Yellow Specs are going - 
they are gathering all round & its all Yellow 
It is an oval - & all yellow.
     Now. theres thick white Streaks 
going up the Water, towards it. the streaks went 
about, and spread. out larger & then Smaller 
the yellow ball moves about. the white streaks 
seem to blow it about, it gets nearer the top
and the white streaks get longer, it looks like                  104
[loud?] blowing it up as like foam its getting nearer
the top - the white now looks like froth. Now
I don't know whether its the water going down
or the ball and the froth going up, but I can't see
the bottom now. I think its the water going
down.
Now the water's changing color its
getting quite a green tinge on it now there's the 
Top of the water, and the waves, rough waves
Still the white froth seems pushing the
yellow ball along - blowing it upwards, as the
ball gets nearer the top it begins to change
its get[s] longer & smaller nearer the top. it begins
to change - larger in some parts than it is in
others towards one end it gets quite small
[toward one end it gets] and then there's a round
ball and at the other end it tapers gradually.
The white foam plays over it and in some places
seems to stick to it, it seems gradually getting
into a human shape, and the white stuff - 
makes the dress - I can see the hands and
arms now. All the white stuff! gone up &
now it comes down over the figure - it's rising
out of the water gradually getting upright.
Now the feet are on the top of the water and
its standing upright, I can begin to see
the features, these white things still seem to
group and the figure stands in front of the
froth., theres hair now on it's head the white
dress is fastened at the waist with [Hues?]
as though the pink specs had come out again
it has a beautiful face, blue eyes light lovely
hair the lightest of the yellow specks are
[*105*]

are the color of the hair, and the dress is 
the white Foam theres something coming in 
front of it - Oh its the Cross - it seemed to come 
out of it - its the grey Specks, its a grey Cross 
its getting larger - the feet are getting above 
the water, its more Transparent. like [them?] [steam?] 
its going right away, farther off, its getting 
smaller & smaller, theres the three Streaks of 
white one thats not but of the water & the moat 
top. its going away I can scarcely see them 
its gone out of the mirror - Its all [?].

The Vision lasted a 1/2 an hour.

[?]die 16th. Oct. 1855. C.A Mirror

Invoked the C.A

1/2 past 7 PM The C is here in white as usual.

[*2030 
7778*] I sincerely congratulate you on having 
entered another year of your life 
I trust that you will spend many in 
Peace of mind and happiness

I thank you may I ask some further questions

[*7779 2031*] do so

I have received this letter from Mr Ormerod which 
also contains some remarks bearing upon the Subject 
of my Questions.

[*7780 2032*] Read the letter

I read it.

[*7781 2033*] Before making any remarks upon 
his [letter] opinions. I will answer 
your questions. - 
The words of Jesus Christ that he 
brings to bear upon the Subject as
106
an Argument against your doctrine, he
seems to misunderstand
Jesus Christ fulfills the Law of the
Prophets—I have said that the Old
Testament , some portions of it are written
by men having the power of Prophecy
I do not mean to imply as did
Jesus Christ in that speech , that men
because they are prophets , must be
divine — if a man prophesy truly that
prophecy must be fulfilled
The prophets in the Old Testament
foretold that a Christ would Come.
Christ knew this prophecy and
he mentions it truth in that passage
Your responses has answered my first question may I
Remark.
2034
7782
He did not need divine inspiration being
himself part of God. and therefore part
of the divinity
He was not inspired as others are
I have before said that Inspiration was
Solely God writing or acting thro' a man.
May I ask you to define what constituted the Law
If it was not the 10 Commandments as given by Moses
2035
7783
Jesus Christ does not mean the Law
which Moses said he recieved on Tablets
of Stone.
He means the Law of God
If Jesus in these words alluded to the Law of the
Prophets. — and not the Commandments—did the
Jews his hearers so understand it.
2036
7784
Some understood it to be the Son of
[*107*]

Moses, Those who had immediate 
Communion with him. Knew that he 
meant the Law of God.

The Law which had been prophesied of 
and which was then laid down by 
himself

He says that he is come to fulfill the 
Law and the prophets - or rather he 
means that he came to fulfill the 
prophecy of the Law for no man could
prophecy of the Law of Moses for that 
had been given before the prophets 
lived.

Then my Inference is that the Prophets prophesied 
the coming of a Messiah & a new Divine Law, that 
Jesus was that Messiah and his doctrine the 
Law., which prophecy he fulfilled

[*7785 2037*] That is right

[Many] divines appeal to Matt. XXII 32 & 32 & Mark 12 [*XII*] 24 [*26*] 28 [*27*] 
As an indisputable Testimony of Jesus himself to the 
Divine Inspiration of the Scriptures.

[*7786 2038*] I cannot see that those words could 
lead any one to believe in the Divine 
inspiration of Moses. - he relates the 
fact that the Lord spoke out of a bush 
and Jesus Christ again mentions that 
fact and mentions with it that it is 
related by Moses

My remark more immediately - applies to the Declaration 
I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the 
God of Jacob"

[*7787 2039*] I misunderstood you, I thought 
that you spoke more of the fact 
of the Voice having spoken from 
the Bush.
108
2039
7788
Jesus Christ does there contradict the
assertion that his Father, one of the
Holy Trinity is the God of Abraham of Isaac
or of Jacob.

He and his father and Holy Ghost
are the God of the Living

Because all those dead for the time
being are dead unto them. they have no
need then of the Power of God or the
Influence of his Son,  until the time
again comes that they are answerable
for their earthly actions.

May I ask your view then of Luke 24/36 to 44

2040
7789
the Word ["Moses"] was not in the Original
To be a prophet it needs no inspiration
and I may here remark , that it is not
to the priesthood and the clergy or to
them who humbly call themselves
Divines that the answer to what is
Truth is addressed.

It is to those who by them have been
misled, I am perfectly certain that
they will persist in their doctrine were
all the angels in Heaven to war against
it— because by it they can bind men
by fear and lead them by Subjection
to their own great advantage

These men will argue & cavil and 
hold on by a straw to their darling
dogmas — forms & ceremonies. however
great may be the strength of the opposition

There is but one True doctrine of
Religion — All those who have passed
away from Earth know this, I know
109
it—and although the Arguments for &
against. they are nearly equal all the
different creeds may appear weighty to
Man and leave him in doubt at last
It is not so with me every Argument
given , even seeming proof against the
doctrine I have preached cannot in the
least shake my Knowledge of the Truth
and when I say there is but one True
religion , that religion is contained in
the answer to what is Faith. And is
Acknowledged by all who have passed
the boundary of Life — I feel that in all
Sincerity I have done my all.
I explained at length. may I ask your opinion &c
[?790]
2041
do so
Jno. Ch. 5-39. & 45=6-7
2042
7791
Jesus does not there make any Assertion
that Moses is in any way equal to
himself , he only there alludes to him
as a prophet , a man great with man
and noticed by God.
If you will dissect those passages
You will find that in none does he
Assert that Moses is greater than a
prophet.
Jno. 10. v 34.35
2043
7792
He alludes to those by whom he was
immediately surrounded, not those in
Ages gone before — The scripture he
Calls the record of his life
Matthew. 14
2044
7793
A Little word has there been put in
I am sent unto the Lost Sheep
[*110*]

of the House of Israel., it does not 
mean exclusively for them. this cannot 
have any weight against so many other 
passages, when he is declared to be the 
regeneration of mankind - The Saviour 
of all who believe in him, the son of 
God sent into the world to preach 
the Doctrine of Everlasting life, the 
Mediator between God & Man. He who 
promises that those who believe in 
him shall be cleansed and purified, 
even if their sins be as [?] they 
shall be as wool.

May I remark that in saying "the Necessity of a 
Saviour must be obvious to all. - It is objected by 
Mr Ormerod that it was not evident to the Antient 
[?] Philos'r. and was probably [not?] even to the Jews

[*7794 2045*] I meant that remark for persons 
now living

It has been observed that there are no hopes held 
out by Jews to those who have not the means. the possibility 
of believing, that they shall be saved, indeed it is 
one of the valued items of the stock in Trade of 
Itinerant Missionaries & their advocates. that the 
Souls of the Heathens are perishing

[*7795 2046*] They are no where denounced by him 
and if you believe that God is a 
God of Mercy, and of Justice & that 
he is allso all powerful can you at 
the same time believe that He has 
not made some provision for all 
those who have not been able to 
receive the Words of his Son.

It is with them as with those 
in far distant Lands where the Light
[*111*]

of Knowledge had never yet shone 
heated by God, and allowed by him to 
remain in ignorance they are recieved by 
him as sinless -

I returned thanks & while doing so Emma said here is 
more reading come

[*2047 
7796*] Mr Ormerod speaks of the indefinite 
form of Truth. Now it strikes me that 
many men ready to receive the true 
Religion, and feeling convinced of what 
is given in your book, may yet be 
unable to form a longer & definite 
form of belief from it.

Now instead of the one used by 
the Church of England, I would have 
another Substituted for it -

May I ask if you will favor us with it, now or next 
Tuesday Evening

[*7797 2048*] I will give it you now I have been 
led to this remark by Mr Ormerods 
that he does not think you have 
given sufficiently your opinions, Your 
belief that ha[s] led to so Null a View 
of the Truth.

[*7798 2049*] - There is one God - the Embodiment 
of all goodness, all Charity, all love 
the Creator of the Human race - 
Emanating from Him are His Divine 
Qualities - His influence, His Holy 
Spirit and His Son.

God has Angels in His 
Presence - perfect as himself in purity 
in Goodness, & in Truth. but unlike 
himself - neither All mighty, All knowing 
or All powerful - their Capacities are
Priests.
     “In the Church of Christ there is but one Supremacy,
but one sacrifice, but one priest; and he who believes this
antient, apostolic, Catholic, unchangeable tradition, is 
free of the Universe  calls no man master in religion 
and spurns away from him,.  calmly & courteously, yet
with bold and brave determination, any man that
would stand between him and his redeemer in the
Solemnities of his worship, and in the communion of 
his soul with GOD."
                   Eclectic Review 1851, 1/233
[*2049*]                                                                                                                         [*112*]
[*7799*]

are limited, his are boundless.

There exists an antagonist to all this 
Good in the shape of an Angel fallen 
from this High degree; He is the power 
of Evil, always at Enmity with God 
Always striving(?) to rule His Creation 
by gaining man, the greatest of 
Acquisitions over to him & Subservient 
to his Will.

This power of Evil becoming so 
strong it [is] was necessary that God should 
send into the World His Son to arm 
Man with a weapon by which he 
might defeat the power of Evil.

This weapon is his Word given 
by his son to Man in the New 
Testament - Having given that Word 
to Man as a sure passport in all 
after ages to Eternal happiness, he 
gives to man his mortal body 
returning as pure in Spirit as when 
he descended from God.

The two are again one and that 
Holy Spirit is still the [humain?] 
influence that is felt in the hearts 
of those who are willing to be 
Christian Men.

Through the intercession of His 
Son God saves those who believe in 
Him - but through his own Love 
and Charity to His Creation the Human 
Race, He saves others. -
[*113*]

[*2049 
7799*]

It is evident from his Word that I 
He never intended, for the Creation of 
Man was not an Afterthought. to 
allow his Creation to get so far 
under the influence of Evil as to be 
Everlastingly damned - He will 
punish those who have lived with 
utter disregard to Him as the Almighty 
Those who have acted wrong, when 
they might have acted right, those 
who knew they were doing wrong, 
those who were Conscious of their Sin. 
at the time of Committing it. These 
are punished, many lastingly but 
under no Circumstance whatever will 
everlasting punishment take place. 
The Almighty will show the power 
of good over Evil by taking at the 
last the whole of His Creation and 
gathering them[self] to himself as at 
the beginning - The World will be 
destroyed and with it the Tempters 
the Power[s] of Evil and all will 
know that Christ is

do you think it would be best to publish it as

his letter "State my own Creed"

[*2051 8001*] The author of what is Truth repeats 
that [letter] question at the end of his

Yesterday died Sir William [Mobigarth?] one of Her

[*2052

death, it is advisable not to call

When will it be agreeable for us to see him.

by that degree of accuracy which has been preserved. 
then there could be no absolute necessity for that higher 
degree which Lord Bolingbroke here demands.

his belief -

To say that the Scriptures must exhibit a literation 
and punctuation accuracy through all their transcriptions 
and versions or they cannot be accepted as inspired 
& then there are only two methods of fulfilling this regimen:

Either GOD must by his own hand produce every 
Copy, or if men are to by Copyists & translators from age to 
age & from nation to nation then in the very nature of 
things, errors could not be prevented but by a perpetual 
and universal miracle. which could be a far greater 
miracle than the production of the sacred books at first -

But GOD does not lavish miracles even for 
the sake of preserving his own word immaculate

In your response you use the term "Bible" Christians
use that term to include the Old and New Testament
may I ask your definition
2058 8008
I mean the life of Christ and his
doctrines preached by his disciples 
I recognize no other as "the Bible"

If the New Testament is to be the standard of our
Faith & Truth need fear no amount of [misogenation?]
is it not imperative on men to subject the existing
MSS. of the scriptures to the same rigid scrutiny as
they would a contemporary book of a classic author
to see that new "Commentary" of some conflicting sort has
merged with the text and this leads me to ask
how it was with the Text on so much power a state
than one can possibly be - there arose in the first 3
centuries after the death of JC. so many and so ranging
sects of Christians animated with the most deadly
feelings of Theological hatred towards each other
2059 8009
As the time when Jesus Christ was
born men were at great variance
with each other on points of Faith
and it seemed likely that the
majority would fall from a belief
in the God of the Jews, to no belief
at all, Jesus Christ was then a
man upon earth, He was not known
or believed to be of divine origin, His
first talking to the Jews when he
was scarcely 14 years of age, so
decisively of right and wrong made
them wonder, and they believed
[*117*]

[*2059*]   
[*8009*] 
him to be something more than they 
could understand, and then when
he healed the sick and performed
Miracles, and preached a doctrine that
was quite new to them, they said no
man could do this and they pointedly
asked him "who art thou" - and he
said

"I am that I am" that is the
Same with God,  the one governing
Power of Creation -

After doing these marvellous works
and showing himself to be possessed
of an extraordinary power, it necessarily
caused great discussion amongst the
multitudes who followed him about 
-- some worshipped him, some thought
him an imposter, persecuted him &
denied him, this of course caused
much dissention and much cavil and
opinions and beliefs sprang up
that were (?mediums?) between his
worshippers and his revilers.

Your response leads again to the point as to the
accuracy of the New Test Text - if in the infancy
of Christianity such differences arose is it not probable
that the Text in the hands of such men whom Charity
compels us to own, may have been well intentioned, may
have been altered, warped as it were  If their peculiar
view & [?this?]  - whilst copies only existed in MS - when
we perceive that, Taking the same MSs for a basis
the Roman Catholic - the Protestant Catholic and the
Unitarian  -  have produced, such different versions
& advocate such widely different doctrines as in the
3 Translations now before us. May I ask you
what was the Inscription placed by Pilate

Mark XV       26  "The King of the Jews."
Luke XXIII    38  "This is the King of the Jews"

Hebrews ch. XI     Note to "Echo"
When perusing the 11th Chapter of St Pauls Epistle to the Hebrews
It must be remembered that Paul was in descent and Education
wholly a Jew.

acts XXII  .3   "I am verily a man, a Jew born in Tarsis in Cilicia
                        yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel
                        taught according to the perfect manner of the Law
                        of the Fathers.

That in this Epistle to the Jews on "the Efficacy of Faith" he
quotes from their History, their sacred writ. the display of
individual faith as therin recorded and  by them believed 
with equal faith. - it would have been useles to have sought
for evidence to the Jews from any other source.--
     Paul himself distinctly says that he suited his Arguments
to his hearers

1 Corr  Ix 20
                 21   "And unto the Jew I became as a Jew, that I might
                         gain the Jew, and to them that are under
                         the Law, as under the law that I  might gain
                         them that are under the Law" 

                                                                          Turn over

8010  The only inscription was the mockery
of his name.
     "Jesus God of the Jews"
and the rabble shouted to him if you
are whom you profess to be, show your
power by coming down from the Cross
and saving yourself --

May I observe how completely your answer is a Case
in point -- Your response differs from the Evangelists &
they all differ from each other.  their versions are / read them /

2061
8011  There is the slightest possible difference
in either --
    The word King was not used because
it was in mockery of his saying, that
he was greater than King.

Your answer would appear  the most probable one as
Jesus laid Claim to being the Son of God, & consequently
the God of the Jews,  but not their King -- and Pilate
Evidently placed the inscription to annoy the Jews.
more than the followers of Christ.

2062
8012  It is so
The whole of the sentence has in it such
studied mockery & such bitter hatred
as only those can use who disagree and
persecute each other about religion

Mr Ormerod at my request made such remarks as
on perusal suggested themselves to him,  in his reading the
answer to what is Truth -- I amongst others  in opposition
to any Views of the Old Test. worthies - remarked "How different
an Estimate did the writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews
form of the Character of the Saints of the Old Testament
see Chapter Xi."  to which I replied as opposite - may I
ask your view

2063
8013  You are right.
[Because by Faith they retain]  / Sic / Because by
1 Corr IX. 22   

"To the weak, became I as weak, that I might 
gain the weak, I am made all things to 
all men that I might by all means save 
some"

Hence I think this Chapter (Heb. XI) does not prove 
the individuals therein mentioned Saints or that 
Paul - then deemed them to be so - but rather that 
had Paul been desirous of showing the disastrous 
consequences of a "Want of Faith" he would have quoted
the same persons in support.

Thus "Abraham who through faith had offered up 
his son" by want of Faith - Abraham passed off his 
handsome wife Sarah - as his sister upon Pharoah 
for which the innocent Pharoah got "plagued with 
great plagues" Gen XII. v17

Thus "Sarah who through Faith received strength 
to conceive seed & was delivered of a child when passed 
age " By want of Faith compelled Abraham to 
commit the detestable crime of turning Hagar & his own 
Child into the wilderness  to starve upon a loaf and a 
bottle of water - so affectingly described in Gen. XXI. 14. 15. 16

Thus "by Faith Isaac blessed Jacob & Esau
concerning things to come".  and by "Want of Faith 
blessed the wrong Son first - Gen XXVII.

&c &c &c  ? ( te te te? or +c +c +c)

"Saints" -  Heb VI. 10 -  Romans 1 .7. VIII. 27 - Jude 14 - also - Psal XVI. 3  Deut XXXIII. 2

The use of the Epithet Saint as a distinctive title prefixed to
the names of a particular class or member of Christs followers.
has no warrant whatever in Scripture"

E O, Ash. MD.  Notes on the New Test't
p. 26

"The lateral term is Holy one #  in Deut. & Jude it probably means Angels
as there can be no absolute certainty respecting the real Character of Men
in the Sight of God, All human decision as to who are to be regarded
or heeded as saints must be fallacious -- Doctor Eadie Bib  Cyclo:

2063    
8013  Faith they gain an especial favor or
blessing, it is not to be considered that 
their whole lives are good, or that their 
faith can triumph over all things. 
     St Paul did not mean this, He only 
meant to show that one act pleasing 
in the sight of the Lord, met its reward
     That Faith was acceptable to him 
and he recited those particular instances 
to show that  that Faith was openly 
rewarded while on Earth, it was the same 
then as now. 
    If you know that a man has 
done many bad actions, that he is 
no better than any of the rest of men 
and at the same time you know that 
he has done one good and praiseworthy 
action, if you are unprejudiced & 
truthful you will acknowledge that 
one action when heating of the subject 
to which it relates as though the 
whole tenor of his life was of the same 
same stamp.

I thank you, may I observe that the subject of the
Pure Test -- of the New Testament - is of such vital
importance - that I wish at some future Evening to
again bring it before you.

The Horoscope to the particulars relating to "that
great thinker".
8021                I do remember it now, I remember 
                        Every thing that has passed from 
                        my birth to my death.
As at the time you edited Hobbes, I may presume
You believed in the truthfulness of his views & Since 
has become [adherent?] to Spiritualism philosophy
May I for edification ask your altered views
8022                 I changed my belief but I was in
                          greater [?] than before
                          Had I died a Deist or an
                          Atheist, the Mercy of God might have
                          Saved me, but to believe in Spirits
                          and yet deny the Spirit of God the
                          governing power of all spirits seems to
                          me now unpardonable but I have 
                          a hope that it is not so.
At the moment of death when the 
Whole [wents?] of a life of many Sins
passed before me like a phantasma going
through my brain. I felt in the 
inmost recesses of my soul the light 
by which the darkness of all good deeds 
might be dispersed, but even  then
I could not recognize this light as
the redeeming power of Jesus  Christ and 
 I died wavering or  rather before my death
 I wavered for my last thought was
given to Earth
Although I felt the influence of the Son of God in my heart. I
could not recognize it I could not 
believe it because my reason was
at war with my heart
[I felt that I knew] (sic) I thought 
that I knew the Sons of Christianity,
the [disp???] and Controversies about it 
sufficient to make me acclaim that 
Jesus Christ was not one with God
And the mind being singularly Clear 
of pressing when it is about to be 
obliterated forever, I went back to the 
beginning and I only saw in the Son
of God, the Child of Shame and a
 living wonder - had my last thought
been given to Heaven instead of Earth 
I am certain, that in that moment
I should have been Convinced against 
reason that my Salvation could 
only be obtained by one means.
My [?] if you are [?] that you are now
Communicating with [?] [animals?] still living on the Earth.
I can. I here still your feelings
122
? Your conception of earthly things, a longing
once more to be in contact with Earth
to be back again with those that I
have left - For this seems a dull cold
void - and yet I have power greater
then I had on Earth.  For I know
that things exist, that when there I
repudiated with scorn

I explained the CA [i?] view of the one [?] way.
8024 I have sinned, I do believe the truth

and his love but is it not now too late

[?] next to being led aright myself
and securing happiness from that source
When alone it can be obtained, I derive
nothing more than that those I have
left behind me should while upon
earth be placed in the right path
they must be so far happier, so much
stronger at the last if they can die
in Faith and belief of the Trinity and
of the Divinity of Christ.

Even if one gains happiness at
last it is a dreadful process to it, and
I think the happiness must be
much greater if you receive it at once
as a reward - rather than secure it
as a boon granted from Mercy after
long suffering in patient endurance.

May I ask if you left a wife or children surviving you

[symbol] 6 Nov. 1855 CA Mirror
Invoked the CA
My seer having unfortunately been too unwell to inspect
I was not able to invoke last Tuesday. May I [?]
8031 2067 do so 
If Adam when in paradise had not sinned would
the encrease of the human race have taken place
8032 2068 Yes
Would Adam then & his descendants lived for ever
8033 2069 they would all have lived until the
Earth was changed, but it was foreseen
that they could not exist without sin
and the hereafter was anticipated
In Romans V Verse 12 it is written "wherefore as by one man
Sin entered into the World, and death by Sin; and so
death passed upon all Men, for that all have Sinned"
If death was thus the effects of Adams Sin, did it
also fall on the ? Creation, or would the animal 
world also lived forever.
2070                    Men's Sin makes no difference to the rest
8034                    of Creation, one would have passed away
                            as now to give place to another.
May I observe that I cannot Conceive how such corporeal
forms as [we?] now possess ( even if disease was unknown)
Could possibly last 1000 years. -- even the human form
? to the fall different from its present ?
2071                     They were the Same
                              It was known to God when he Created the 
8035                      World all that should happen unto the 
                               End -- therefore he knew that Adam
                               & Eve would Sin -- although they might have
                               remained free.
Ethnologists divide the existing human Race into 
Several Classes -- & when we compare the Caucasian or 
European with the N. American Indians or the [Mexicans?/Mulattos?]
with the Negroes, it seems almost impossibly that
Climate alone should make the difference, seeing
for instance that the Children of the Dutch inhabitants
of the Cape after Years [Iroquois?] are as white at
Birth as though born in Europe.
2072                        The Immediate descendants of Adam 
8036                        were born of Various Colors, so that they
                                 might form distinct Races.
Did that take place before or after the Deluge.
8037 2073                Before
Was the flood Universal ie all over this Earth
8038 2074 It was not
Am I then to Conclude that the Colored Races are 
the descendants of those born before the Deluge and 
not part of the [Nordic?] Family
125

2075 
8039  The colored races were derived from the 5th
and 6th generation after Adam
The flood did not totally destroy them
the centre of the earth was flooded but
not the remote parts - all was destroyed
for many thousand miles round Noahs
Ark and from him are descended the
inhabitants of the South.

Are you aware that our Earth is a sphere, nearly
Globular & not a plain

2076
8040  I am aware of it, there are great undulations
in that part were the Mountains rise the
flood did not reach, but the plains of
the land and a large portion of the Sea
was much above the present heighth.

I am aware by the action of the Tides that it is
possible for the water at [determed?] periods rising
higher on one portion of the Earth. & falling lower at
its antipodes, & that this may have occurred at the 
deluge for a longer period & greater heighth than
ever since known. but may I remark that now &
for many Centuries past the fair Races inhabit the
North & as they get more South they vary until
quite black

2077
8041  Noahs Ark was not pitched on the 
Land, it was  in the greatest part of
the flood on the Sea.

May I now make an observation, with great deference
to you [?] - That your answers to Metaphysical
Questions are so admirable & prompt.  Whilst your
answers to Physical Enquiries are so often opposed
to what as Mortals we know to be correct.

2078
8042   There is a difference 
that which belongs to the mind or the
Spirit, or to the Spirit world Ive know
immediately & at once, it is part of our
own being.
That which belongs to the Earth
126

8042  and to man Physically, we only underst'd
through him, as he does  the Spirit World
through us. -- But I must say we know
all the Laws of Nature and we understand
creation as it comes from the hand of 
GOD, but we cannot quite rightly underst'd
the names and the forms which man
assigns to it.

Accept my thanks  I hope you do not feel offence at
my having so placed this observation before you

2079    8043  Can you think me spiritual & pure &
Yet think that I shall be offended

I mean that I hope you doubt image  I placed
it before you doubtingly =  I have the highest respect
& esteem for your obliging responses

2080  8044  I do not doubt it, altho I cannot
entirely comprehend the body, I can
fully understand the mind & all its 
workings
     Spirits can feel sorrow for Man
and pity but they can never feel other
than love for the whole human Race.

On Tuesday Week I called Sir N'm.  M. - his responses
gave rise to many serious thoughts, but as he
could not give me any proof convincing to others, I
do not desire to Call him again unless he has a
wish to appear.

2081  8045  he has no particular wish to appear
but there is no harm in his doing so.

As Emma is still unwell, could we have the
continuation of the Vision this evening, it would perhaps
ease her.

Should we continue it on the Tuesday after that or

2084   8048  You can see the whole of the Vision first

Can we see Mr Anderson this Evening

2085  8049  You can

Can you explain to me why Mr Anderson's At. Spirit
even when he appears serious & candid never tells me
truly the names of persons, places, streets &c

2086   8050  His atmosphere Spirit is but the Shadow
and the Echo of his Body: He would
tell you just the same in reality

but may I observe I never could get my own A.S.
to answer me rationally or seriously on the Contrary
he always behaved most frivolously

2087  8051  At. Spirits are not always the same as 
their representatives upon earth.
He might not behave the same now if
you called him -
  It is when communicating with you that
they lose their power. When they are

trump up some fine thing to tell you.

have you in the spirit world had any communication
with Lieut  R F Burton

8057  No he is just as far from me as he is from you

do you know if he ever used the mirror  or Crystal I gave
him with success

8058   I know nothing about him.

do you know Mr Anderson

8059  yes

do you know where he now is

8060  with the Army in the East

You now appear in the same clothes as I have on.  have
you the same things in your waistcoat pocket.

8061  It seems rather impertinent to ask so
many questions

May I ask you to show my Seer what you have
in your Waistcoat pocket

8002   I shall not.

I will not ask any more questions that you may deem
frivolous, but I will ask if you have Changed Your
Religious opinions -- are they the same as mine

8063  I know yours but I dont believe it right

May I ask what reason you can give against my
believing in the atonement through J. C.  


129

8064  I am a Unitarian & So would you be
in a few days time were you not persuaded
otherwise.

I cannot conceive how you entertain a different
Opinion from me of you are my  AS.

8065  I entertain the opinion you would do
were you not blindly led in the dark

Can you give me any reasons against the belief
in the Doctrine of the Atonement 

8066  If you throw off all bondage & make
your mind perfectly free, you will see
nothing to support the belief of a 
Son. - There is a written testimony
but is that testimony true.
     Of the Creative power I have no Doubt
of His Universal Spirit I have no
doubt - because they must exist to keep
the world in unison & Harmony. but
there is no evidence to show that by the
life and death of one man the world
is redeemed.

The Doctrine of Sacrifices is necessarily an abstruse
one yet it undoubtedly forms the most antient & most
Universal rite ever practised - & when we look at the
Religious state of the world at the time of Christs 
appearance - notwithstanding it had produced [?]
[?] Zoroaster Pythagoras Socrates Plato Aristotle 
Euclid & so many others. Yet the great Bulk of
Mankind was steeped in abject ignorance. believers
in Polytheism Sabaism & Idolatory. & only the Jews
had made any approach to a publicly recieved
Rational Religion  it seems to me to have been absolutely 
necessary that some Divine Missionary should
be sent into the world to place Man in the Path
of Truth.- that Mission was fulfilled by Jesus 
& when at the Crucifixion his Spirit reascended to GOD
the body was accepted as a sacrifice for Sinners
130
8067
No amount of argument can bring me the
least connection, I have told you my
belief, I do not wish, I do not intend to
Change it. if its wrong it will not hurt
me, one thing I am certain of. If you
had, had Orion for your Guardian Spirit
as I wished you before you would have been
a great deal better off.
Are you then devoted to the Same Occult Studies as
I am here
8068
I am, and my friend Orion, assists me
to [?] he is not quite so high as he
was. but he is worthy of a better post
has he taught you any thing curious in Magic Science
which you would like to inform me of.
8069
I cannot practice Magic as you do, being
Spiritual, I am using it all but Orion
has Shown me many Curious things
interesting things , very interesting
I went with him but a very short
time ago into where all the Dreadful
bad people that leave the Earth are
Confined , I saw a Bishop although
he had been dead many years was
Still Counting out his money , although
through Doing it so long & so often Every
vestige of flesh was gone from his hands
The inordinate thirst for Gold is [?] a
[?] Vice— that pastime may do for a Spiritual
bishop, but on this Earth they prefer to be with
[?] & Good [?] lined — Give [?] & Balls. + act
the Gentlest the [?] — what Else did Orion do.
8070
He Entertained me very much by showing
me how to bring the Spirits of that place
into the Atmosphere and also by showing
me how to resist those wandering Spirits
on the Earth to any particular mortal of
Course I did not intend to do it. Still
131

I was much pleased with the idea

Have you any objection to tell me how those spirits
were brought into the atmosphere.

8071  By visiting them & making them believe
we had in the atmosphere that for which
they particularly longed -- that for
which they had sinned

Can you tell me the Formula for fixing certain
wandering spirits upon any person.

8072   You'd be doing that besides  You'd be 
telling Mr Lea. about it, and he's deep
enough in already.

do you know my friend Lea's At Spirit

8073   Yes very well
How does he get on in the Spirit World with his Hardies

8074  No better than he does at Limehouse.

I cannot conceive the reason.  Can you.

8075  He was never cut out for it, he does not
go about it rightly.

but i cannot conceive how his wife lost the power
of Seeing, after she had seen so well

8076   I should have been very much surprised
if she had retained it, that's the difference
     Theres on Old Gentleman wishes to see
you in this mirror, hes writing now.

May I ask you his name.

8077   He is an old man and has got a trumpet
in his ear  You know him very well
and I believe this will be the last time
that you will see him.

Is it Robert Owen the philantropist.

8078  no answer

May I advise you to change not only Your Religion 
but your Company or at the last you may wish
to catch hold of the skirts of my coat but as Momma
says I will fling you all & wear a spencer.

8079   You have given me your very kind advice 
in return my I say a word
132

8080  Which is worst.  to learn what you are
and to acknowledge what you do as Orion
does - leaving you to find out that he is
much better than he really seems to be
Or - [?] the guise of being much better
than you are Conceal a traitor, a hypocrite
and a destroyer. glossed over with a too
simple and Confiding Veil - as some
one who enters into Communion with man.

I hope at another opportunity you will appear if
you have no objection

8081  I have not, if you have no objection Orion
would like to appear., I have wished him
to do so - he would entertain you give
Your instructions and advice and be a
very kind companion not only in the
Mirror but out of it , at all times will
he attend you.

I can only allow spirits to appear in this Mirror
who can withstand Exorcism --
Now he's going
20 ' to 10 PM.

I said          If Mr. Robert Owen we shall be happy
                    to see him but him only
Here is someone coming  it is Mr Owen  Black frock coat
black velvet skull cap.  - no trumpet.
Good Evening Mr Owen we are pleased to see you in the
Mirror. I hope you are well

8082  He shakes his head

May I ask if you can hear me Speak to you

8083 I am getting very feeble

I am sorry indeed to hear that. have you published
part 7. of your life yet.
He looks at you very hard his beard under the chin
is very white - he shakes his head - now hes going, hes
turned round nodded his head smiled & gone.
14' to 10 PM.

Invoked the CA.
The C A is here
I have received this letter from Mr [?] may I read
it to you
209[0]1
8084
[?]You can do so, but I am in some
part aware of its contents from its
influence over your mind
I read the letter, havE I made my self understood

You have
8085
He rejects Spiritualism on religious
grounds — You will see him shortly
and your opinions are sufficiently
Wrong to be Expressed on the Subject
he first mentions
But as regards Spiritualism
and its accordance with the Laws
of God, I should wish you to remain
at that meeting as neutral as
You can , receive his Argument
against it and givE it me as nearly
as you can against next Tuesday
Evening
It is my Cause to refute it
I will use all my power to share
[my] the objection that he holds, if
my answer does not agree with
your opinions in some measure
or you should wish to introduce
more you can alter it and then
givE it him as your own opinions
I do not wish you to say much
before for fear that not Knowing
all you may appear contradictory
I will not upon your advice
8086
2093
If I can help you more I am willing
on Last Tuesday Evening I was much concerned to
find that my at Spirit continues his Connexion

134
with Orion and so [?] adheres to his former
proposal for me to have him for a guardian Spirit
I cannot concieve the cause.

2094   8087  Orion is continually in the Atmosphere
and he communicates with him
He would willingly appear to you if
he could

I will never call him  without our previous Sanction

2095  8088  If you see him it must be in the
Crystal, I shall not allow him to 
appear in this mirror

May I ask as I am not prepared with Queries
If we can have the continuation of the vision & also
commences with the promised memoirs of Cagliostro

2096  8089  You can.

If any &c

2097   8090   I have not
Your At Spirit desires to appear
he observes you requested him to do so

I hope my seeing him will not hinder my rec'g
the Vision or memoirs

2098  8091  It will not  -- 

The  C A's gone
5' past 8 PM      Called my A S. Fred Hockley
Good Evening

8092  Will you do me a favor

Yes if its one I can do with the consent of the C. A.

8093  Its too slight to need the consent
of any but yourself
     I wish you to look in the Crystal
or your other mirror for 5 minutes

I am anxious to receive this Evening a communication
I have long waited for.  and have not the time now
to spare.

8094  It will not detain you long now,
I wish you particularly to look

I have a great wish  You would defer it till next
Tuesday

8095  I cannot defer it
135

Shall my Seer turn round & inspect the Oval 
MIrror

8096  Yes

12' past 8. Nemy so urgently requested I very reluct'tly 
consented & Emma inspected the Oval mirror

Its very thick  heres something silvery coming, now 
its all black.  It looks like part of a mans cloak 
now I can see the legs, it is a cloak now I can 
see the head coming , a dark man, black curly 
hair.  Moustachios  beard underneath the chin 
black velvet cloak coming down to the knees fastened
in the front & at the neck with a chain, a very large
heavy Cloak.
May I ask you Name

8097          ORION

May I ask why you have been pleased thus to appear

8098   I was desired to do so by your 
atmospheric spirit he asked me 
to communicate with you.

Have you then any thing you wish to communicate to 
me.
Emma here said now his black coat's gone & he is in
armour.

8099  I have that to Communicate for which he 
sent me

May I request you to inform me what that is

8100   Your At spirit told me you were
desirous of having a formula by
which you might fix the wandering
spirits of the earth upon any
particular human being.

that is so are you willing to tell me how it is done

8101  Yes
You have to use these words at
the same time fixing your mind
firmly on the object you desire
     You must think some time
See a portion of the Seal & Spell as copied
from memory -- the words are the remainder
of the original spell which was not burnt.
       opposite page 133
136
before of the person you wish them
to join
     You must first write these
words in the blood of a Lamb or
a sheep  thus making it a
sacrifice to those who give the 
power and then inwardly and
earnestly repeat as if reading from 
that you have written. -

Emma said now heres a Circle Come all white with
Red figures in it -- she then made an accurate
copy (of which some resemblance is placed opposite)
She then said here is short lines or reading all
Round it beginning at the top,  upon her attempting
to read -- the Seal turned round so as to bring the
words direct under Eye. - and she read the inscription
which consisted of a Conjuration & Command by the
Power of [Azril] &c & the Seal, to attach him or
themselves [at?] (the party) -- divided into 3 equal
divisions by red spots. -- this occupied a very 
long time & I became exceedingly fearful the C A
would take offence & not give us the vision or
Memoirs =
     When the first Seal & the Invocation was
Completed  there came -

8102  "There is a seal made to Correspond
with this which you place above
it.
[Illustration]
they fit exactly over the Red holes
in the last and so connect the
two seals.

I then said it is now 9 oClock may I ask you
to give me the further instructions another time

8103  I cannot another time
137

I was never very anxious that the vision should cease
as I wanted to continue my Seance' with the CA
mirror & said
May I request you to leave that I may continue
my vision in the other mirror

8104  Will you dismiss me then before
I finish my communication

My At Spirit said,  you would only occupy 5 minutes
It has now occupied more than an hour.  besides
Your Communication can only be used for base
purposes -

8105   Then you should have said at first 
that you would not have received it
Your atmospheric Spirit is urging
me to stay.

I exorcised & dismissed Orion
3[81?]

                               C. A Mirror
                                   Invoked the C A.
Emma said you are here again
Why have you again appeared uncalled

[2099]  8106    I wish to say a few words
I must trust to the very slight Courtesy
you seem to possess to hear me
     I should not have believed you
to be the counter part of myself, either
from your treatment of me or my
friend Orion  who appeared at my 
request.
     You requested me last Tuesday
evening to appear.  I did so
     I answered your questions  I gave
you advice that you might have
benefitted from.
     Your pride I suppose is too great
to receive any information that you
138

8107  believe inferior to your own judgment
you requested me to appear again
I did so.
     You requested me to give you
the Charm by which the wandering
spirits of the Earth and Air are
made to prey upon a mortal
     I requested Orion who is more
competent to do so  to give it you
     When he came for that purpose
and you had received as much as
your curiosity induced you to long
for --  you are not particular to
enquire if its Evil until then. -
Your goodness & purity becomes
alarmed, and you fly off to 
something else, to satisfy another
longing for the marvellous.
     I do not blame you for this
but I think that Common Courtesy
ought to be observed in your dealings
with all.
     You should not make the 
distinction of flattering and praising
one for what you dont want and
tell the other that what he has given
you is evil although you longed to
know it.

It is your own fault -- You said it would only occupy
5 minutes & I have lost an hour & a half.

8108  It was your fault being
detained an hour, it was [?] thing
at once  you might have done if
in 3 minutes.  

139

I wish I could induce you to give up your [??nexion]
with Orion

8109  As to giving up Orion  I shall not
do it any more than you giving
up your acquaintance however
bad or good.  and there are many
even upon earth as Evil as Orion
but a human form can hide it
human deceit can clothe a serpent

I do not wish to hold any further communication
with you.  You well know the troubled life I have
led, and I do not wish now to recieve knowledge
in Black Magic - applicable only to base purposes
I know too much of that already.

8110  If cant and hypocrisy are the only
roads by which your heart and 
mind are open  there are others
You can communicate with who will
soon lead the too Easy Way.

hes gone
22' past 9 PM.
                   Invoked the CA to appear
Now you are come back
Why have you again appeared

8110   You might have wished me Good night

Good night and let me beg you to give up your
dealings with Black Magic

8112  You are afraid You have done thing
in recuring that Seal at all and
now you wish to lay it upon my 
shoulders.

hes gone
1/2 past 9
                   Invoked the CA
Now you are Come back again and I said

8113  You seem to have a fickle fancy
and a changeable mind

Now you are gone.
140

Ex: the Mirror
                      Invoked the CA.

2099  8144  "The CA will appear at ten o Clock."

10 PM.          Invoked the CA
The CA is here
I explained the transaction which had taken place 
and that I had burnt the Seal & formula

2100   8115  If you can help it, it must not 
happen again - Orion is Evil when 
you have once entered into Communicat'n 
with Evil it is not so Easily Shaken 
off - whilst the slightest influence 
of his was remaining either on the 
Seal or in the Mirror, and your 
Atmospheric Spirit so earnestly 
desiring him to remain   I could 
not allow any other vision to 
appear for as I vouch for [all] the 
goodness of all that I show I 
must be doubly careful of preserving 
it pure.
I am Sorry that it has happened 
this Evening

I hope it will not make any difference or hinder 
the Visions appearing on another Evening

2101  8116   The Seals were very powerful that 
Orion gave you, with them you 
cannot only Command one of the 
wandering Spirits but a whole tribe
     You could have kept the copy 
in Ink, without any harm as it 
is ineffectual unless written as he 
told You.

I explained my reasons - If any &c

2102   8117   Your motives & wishes are quite right
I have not

Action Ended

♂︎die  20' past 7 PM - 20th Nov. 1855.   C A Mirror
                                Invoked the C. A
May we have the cont'n of the Vision & commence with
the Memoirs of JO Balsamo  this Evening

2103  8118  You can

May I ask if there is any formula by which Good Spirits
can be attached to Man as in ☍ (opposition) to the spell given me by
Orion

2104   8119  Good spirits can only be attached to men
by their desire for them

I have seen Mr Ormerod, he will on some future Tuesday
Evening attend and state personally his objections as to
Spirit Calling, will that meet your wishes

2105   8120  Yes
I can only say the same as I would now,
that after a few earnest enquiries every religious
objection vanishes
If a man objects to spiritualism because 
it mystifies him, and he cannot control it -
or if he is afraid of its having undue influence
over him -- that is a sufficient individual
reason for his withdrawing from the search
but when he attacks it on so wide a ground
as religion, he makes the cause a Universal
objection, only sought after by those who
have no care for the goodness and truth
of what they seek.

May I ask if you are aware of the different indeed opposite
views held by Roman & Protestant Catholics upon
the institution of the Lord's Supper
     In the Romish Church the priest professes to offer
in the Consecrated Wafer, the real body & blood of JC
The Lords Supper

"Scripture says nothing of an Administrator, Justin mentions
a President, to whom the head and wine were brought, and who offered
thanksgivings and praises to God - In a subsequent age we find a
remarkable contrast, instead of thanksgiving we have Consecration;
and instead of praise we have an oblation.  Tertullian like [?] 
Justin speaks of a president, but we soon find the Consecrat.n
restricted to the Bishop, called Chief Priest if he were present
or in his absence, to a priest without whom the rite could
not be celebrated. 
                        Dr. R Halley   "The Sacraments
                                   London  1851   pp 212    
142

as a Sacrifice for the partakers Sins
     Protestants especially dissenters view it not as a
Sacrifice, but as a Commemoration of the one Sacrifice
by Christ himself for the Sins of the World.
May I solicit your views

2106  8121  It is almost unnecessary for me to say
that no bread can be the flesh,
no wine the blood.
     It is revolting that such a system sh'd
exist, the words of Jesus Christ "do this
in remembrance of me" clearly show that
he intended it as a custom to be kept in
commemoration of his last meal with 
the whole of his followers.

There are many "religious" persons who in actual life
almost appear to leave their souls at church along with
their prayer books &  hussocks, to be used when wanted who
make no scruple of taking the Sacrament regularly and
there are others who not thinking themselves worthy
never partake-- may I ask if it is religiously speaking
compulsory.

2107  8122   It is not compulsory.  I think it ought
not to be taken by many now in the
world who make it a practise, neither do
I consider those unworthy of it who
have sinned.
     Taken in its finest sense that of rec'g
the meat and drink of Jesus Christ blessed
by him in Commemoration of his death
to me implies that you intend & devoutly
wish to follow in his footsteps
     That you take him as he was upon
143

2107   8122  Earth as you guide and call upon him 
by the signs he left to watch you from his 
divine home
     Viewing it in this light only to be recieved 
by those who are individual followers of 
himself it seems to me a mockery publicly 
to practice it -
     Why should man recieve it from 
the hands of a priest as from Christ 
himself - is not the very act as desecrating 
to him as the Commemoration is pleasing 
I believe that a man is always nearer 
to God and therefore to Christ when he 
is communing with him through his own 
heart - than when he is praising him thro' 
the mouth of a Priest.
     Although men should not receive 
the Communication of Christ with the Knowledge 
and intention of doing wrong in afterlife 
& of Crime they must as far as humanity 
can do determine to devote the remainder 
to holy purposes still it is a very mistaken
notion that you ought not to take it 
because you feel unworthy, it is the very 
penitence and humility that make it 
acceptable.
     If you feel sufficiently strong & good 
to resist every temptation and lead a holy 
life by the strength of that goodness, 
why call upon Jesus Christ through the 
sign which he gave of his humanity to aid 
and assist you
144

One word more
I should strongly advise all those to 
recieve the Sacrament who feel their 
end is drawing near.  it is then most
Essentially necessary.

If any Advice as to the Vision or Memoirs

2108  8123   You will see part of the Vision I will 
defer any explanation until it is all
over. --
     That which Joseph Balsamo will show
You, you will understand
     If you had wished to have kept the
diagram of the seal  Orion showed you 
there could be no harm in that if you 
had destroyed the instructions as to making
it for the other is entirely useless.  unless
offered as a sacrifice in blood

Is it possible that I could have the Seal restored
without applying to Orion for it

2109  8124  You cannot have that back unless
Orion gives it you  but I mentioned this
not so much in reference to that as with
others that you might hereafter recieve.
     If the instructions how to make them
are destroyed the Seals are ineffectual
therefore you Confine to yourself the Knowledge

I ret'd thanks

                         C. A Mirror
1/2 past 8 PM.
8125       The Vision
Now theres something come it looks like an iron bedst'd.
Very low down in the mirror it only looks like the frame
work - its very shadowy - there seems something laying
on it coming - its very like Mr Owen with a black
velvet cap - his face this way, dressed in black, boots
& all on - now its plainer its crimson He's laying on & his
head on a Crimson pillow, its like a sofa with a top
to it, his eyes are shut and he looks very pale, I
don't see any thing else
     Now theres something coming a long
way off behind, something white, its the figure I
last saw come out of the water, he has got the
Cross before him and has got wings   he looks very
high & its coming nearer now.  the old gentleman
laying down is very close, the figures come nearly
to the old gentleman and then went away as quick as
possible now he's stopped again
     Now he's come up again quite close this
time the old gentleman opens his eyes, he's put
his hand across his Eyes, his body seemed to heave
up quick and then sink lower on the bed than before
     Now the Spirits going nearer to him
hes put his hand out and touched the old gentlemans
chest and theres something like smoke no, not
smoke more like steam  come out of the old gent'ns
mouth & conts round - theres some words in it
but they are so small I cannot read them - I
can see ---------- immortality ------- the vapor
goes round and round towards the spirit & gives over
146

over the Old Gentlemans Shoulder as he lies on his
side with his face this way. - his lips move again
but the words on the paper are so small I can
scarcely read them  I can see - The Lord ---
saved -- through - Jesus Christ " now the bedstead
couch is all going down out of Sight.  but the 
white vapor still keeps in to the Spirit it came up
[like a] spirally but now its spread thick in the 
middle  the couch is quite out of Sight.
              Now the Spirit has turned sideways and
the vapor has assumed just the same outline as
the Spirit only no wings   it looks like the shadow
of the Spirit but its so thin and quite flat
now turned round  the thin vapory form is full
front this way and the Spirit behind it and you
can see though a space as it were cut through it
the Vapor is only on this side, it makes one side
of the Spirit look round and the other flat -- the
flat side is the Spirits left side.
                Now its moving upwards  it is strange
the spirit has transparent white robes which
are wrapt round and round so that you cannot
see any feet and Round the vapor so as to hide
the feet   They are going upwards fast or rather
its the space around them going down, Now
theres something dark coming on the top of the
mirror  its clouds  some white & fleecy some dark
& patches of blue it it  just like the Clouds passing
thru the sky
            They seem going up into them or papery
through them - that is the clouds one coming down
Now its clear again theres a tinge of yellow
[Illustration]
147
Coming ovEr it like a Yellow mist now
its getting like Gold & brighter still towards
thE top — Now theres a number of figures
Coming with wings they seem to come
down through all this Golden Color they
[?] all dressed in White , most beautifully
white and transparent — the yellow looks
likes a Golden light over them, they being
so very White Although the angels all
here (No[?]) and the others at 2. they look
An immense distance off , there a great many
theres 12 here altogether. & [?] theres 12
on the side. they are forming themselves
on both sides in a circle & [?] they
make 2 sides of a Circle [?] an
opening at the top & bottom (31 Now
this ones gone up and got into the
Circle at the lower part and they hav#
[?] up ,4) theres a very great diffce.
between the Angel that Came out of the
Water & the other angels, I cannot tell
Why it looks more substantial — its [?]
which looked Snow White alone now looks
[?] a dull leash Color Compared to the
white of the other Angles and its form
is more rigid & Caorser
Now I can see another form
Coming its thick White but of no shape (5)
its Coming in at the top opening its
Coming into the middle [5] & come up
to the [?] if the Spirit to which the
Vapor is [?n], just as the vapor did

8125   Now the last white form and the vapor
seems both to get longer than the Spirit
in the middle & widen & now they
completely meet and cover the spirit all
over  but you can see it thro because they
are so thin but there seems a great
Change the Spirit in the middle seems
melting away then transparency seems
to be going right through him, I cannot
explain it - now its transparent all
through and becoming a beautiful shape
like the others the wings are getting
beautifully transparent - its changing
into one of the Angels, You cannot see
the vapor outside now.
     now its quite like one of the 12
theres no difference its a single figure
lighter & more beautiful & the same tinge
of Gold over it.  
     Those of the 12 that are on the other
side of the Circle are spreading out in
one straight line   now the whole 24
are straight in a line & the one is in 
front of them - the one goes first by
himself - now they all go behind me
they are going gradually up & away
its very shadowy  I only see their
outlines - its veiling - its gone its Clear

25'. past 9 PM
149

1/2 past 9 PM            Oval Mirror
             To receive the Memoirs of
             Joseph Balsamo - Commonly Called
             Count Cagliostro

8126
Its thick now theres a book come such a nasty
dirty little book - bound in dirty dark brown leather
& lighter on patches as though something had been
spilled on it - its very thin there's no letters on the 
outside now the top covers opened & theres a
good deal of Writing, it's a title page, it's getting larger
it's in MS. 

8127

            A Key
      to the Tables of
         Le Roto
or the winning numbers of
       the Lotteries
or games of Chance
           J. C
    Rue  St Antony

That is all on that page and now it's turned over
on to the cover there's no writing in ink on the back
of the Title but its covered with figures in pencil

Emma then described the table & having no
knowledge of the astrological figures caused
me much delay in attempting to describe the
diagram &c on paper - which occupied me
until 1/2 past 10 -.  The diagram is shown
as far as we could - on the other side but
there are a great many figures in the outside
150

as well as in the Circle to recieve --

8128    [large illustration of a circular astrological table]



As it is now nearly 1/2 past 10 & my Seer is fatigued may
I ask if we can have this figure again to copy next Tuesday
Evening --

8129   Yes

May I ask if you have any observation to make before
I close action this Evening

8130  No

1/2 past 10 PM
151

♂︎die 27  Nov'r   1855.      CA Mirror
1/4 to 8 PM         Invoked the C.A
My Seer has suffered much for some days from pain in the 
Nerves of the face, I am afraid without your permission to 
Mesmerise her., may I ask if you can give me any advice 
to relieve her

8131  No answer

Asked again - & mentally

8132   No answer

May I ask when it will be agreeable to you for us to 
receive the cont'n of the Vision we had last Tuesday

2110  8133  You can have it next Tuesday Evening

Last Tuesday - instead of receiving the memories of 
Balsamo's life when on Earth we had a MS entitled 
"A Key to Le Rolo  or games of Chance &c.  this appears 
to be a reference to my MS Copies of Cagliostros 
famous MS. called the Tables of Rotalo - may I ask 
why that which appears to consist of Cabbalistic Tables 
appeared instead of the Memoirs

2111  8134   Joseph Balsamo promised you copies of 
works which he had upon earth so 
that by them you might gather suff't. 
materials to form a knowledge of his 
Life  and also of his means of acting 
in the singular manner that he did
     The book of which you have only 
seen the first leaf. is not a book of 
Tables, it is a MS. written by himself 
for his own use
     I believe that it is the most 
curious that he had - It is not 
what he learnt others but what he 
learnt from.

May I ask if the Oval Mirror is under any Spirit 
or under your surveillance only. - or by whom is 
the vision shown

8135  2112   The author of the MS shows it and 
he has power over it.

When by the means of my Seer I copy the MS
152

Can I ask any question without causing the Vision
to disappear

2113    8136   You can

Can I continue it this Evening

2114  8137   You can

The Apocalypse or Book of Revelations has caused
perpaps more speculative controversy among Protestant
& dissenting Scholars than any other of the New Test'ts
books - and as Theologians are ever ready to wage war
to the Knife against those who differ from them and
may say that no two of them agree.  You may concieve
how difficult it is for one like myself to form a consistent
view of the scope & meaning of the work.  may I ask
when it will be agreeable to you to furnish me with
Your views of the Apolalyptic book.

2115  8138  You can commence it as soon as you 
wish -- I am quite willing to answer
any question on any subject but
more especially on that which is of
much importance   for altho simple
of itself  it is with difficulty understood
-- ---   because the language in [my
opinion] in which it is written is so
different from that in my opinion
it ought to be
    Altho the Origin of is was
a revelation from God -- visions given
to Saint John, it is not written by
inspiration - and he knowing that
 it would be given to the different nations
and in different ages  should not 
have written it in so complicated a
style.

May I ask if i shall read it   a few verses at a time
or a Chapter at once.  & then recieve your views

2116  8139   By a whole Chapter,  I can make
my remarks at the end.


153

Shall I read the first Chapter now.

2117   8140   
Yes

I have before me the Protestant Received translation
The Douay Roman Catholic - and the Unitarian
which shall I read

2118  8141  
The roman Catholic is the most correct
translation but it matters little 
my opinion on all three is the same

I read the first Chapter

2119  8142  
John says he saw this in the spirit
-- It was a dream -- that which
he calls the Angel - was the influence
of God.  His holy spirit through that
he saw the Vision on the sabbath
day.
     He speaks of the Vision of J. C.
as having feet of brass  eyes of fire
hair like white wool from his mouth
a two edged sword -- of Seven Candlesticks
& of 7 stars
     Now the vision of Jesus Christ  [*JC*] as 
so revealed to him was radiant with
light and brightness, a Golden light
fell dazzlingly upon him -- but it
was not like brass or Gold
     John meant that he shone in
exceeding brightness and he likened
it unto brass, and the voice of
Jesus Christ strong & powerful  Yet
low and soft he likens unto many
waters & to a two edged sword.
     The Light which surrounded him 
looked artificial like expiring lamps
and he calls them candlesticks,
whereas the lights in his hands into
154

were radiant & bright he likens unto 
stars.
[*skip a line*]
[I read again verses 19 & 20 remarked]  It appears in v 19 & 20
[here as tho]  that Jesus [Christ] himself called the Lights,  Stars 
& candlesticks 

2120  8143 [*skip*]  The Vice speaks twice   it tells him 
to write what we has seen and send 
it to the Seven Churches - 
               that is his own description between

[Shall I now read the 2nd Chapter]

2121  8144  [Yes]

[I read Chapter II.]                 Chapter 2

2122  8145  It is there written as tho the Spirit 
that appeared to John and gave 
him the advice and Counsel to send 
to the Churches - began his address 
to them by describing himself, but 
it was not so.
      John gives the description of him 
who gives the Counsel.

May I ask your view of those two strange verses 6 & 15 
and what the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes were.

2123  8146  They believed in the Unity not Trinity 
But the words of the vision were 
not put down by John.  when he 
recieved them, and as no man can 
recollect even an hour, afterwards every 
word in a conversation - John rememb'd. 
it less perfectly when he wrote from 
the dream. - Although it is in substance
what he recieved.
     In expressing it afterwards he 
pervades it with the sentiments of a 
Man. -
     Thus it is impossible for any 
Spirit of Purity & goodness removed
155

from Earth to experience any earthly 
feeling - but he says hate.

I ret'd thanks                                       [*// p 167*]
As next Tuesday I am to have the cont'n of the Vision 
& Cagliostro's Memoirs may I continue the Apocalypse 
on Tuesday Week

2124  8147  You can.

If any advice - & mentally as to my Seer

2125  8148  I have a few words to say
Sometime ago, I appeared in Mr. 
Lea's mirror at Limehouse,  I then 
said for the last time, but I have 
reason to believe that what I have 
said about religion made an impression 
upon his mind  that nothing else 
perhaps would do - do you think so

I explained that I felt sure that as my friend Lea 
knew & believed per force, things appertaining to Spiritualism 
which was quite opposed to his reason, or to mathematical 
demonstrations - & yet were True - so he might soon be 
convinced to recieve thro faith that belief which his reason 
would never give him.

2126  8149  It is more acceptable to God when one 
man neither great in faith, in truth 
or in Charity is brought through Jesus 
Christ to a firm belief in him and 
in his holy Spirit - Even at the eleventh 
hour. than it is to receive those who 
living in him have died in him. - 
     He rejoices to recieve a lost sheep 
more than the counted ones in his 
fold.  and knowing this, I would 
willingly place Mr Lea on a surer 
ground than he is at present. feeling 
that I have made an impression on 
his mind, I earnestly wish to communicate 
with him again - because I now
156

8149  certain by the Grace of God, that by 
knocking down the old temple of his 
worship I could                      by faith
     There are appeals that go more
to the heart of man simple yet 
truthful as they are than all books 
written or words penned
     If I could make this appeal 
to his heart by striking at that point 
where his [faith] (sic) belief wavers. I 
fear not my success in making him 
[believe] (sic) walk by faith and not 
by sight - and making him firmly 
assured by the reason of the Soul 
of that Souls Salvation only through 
the death of Christ.

I hope to see him on Friday next & will with your 
permission make an appointment for him to be here 
on Friday week

2127  8150   I would much rather appear in his 
mirror for that purpose.

I had much difficulty to get my Seer to go last time 
to Mr Lea's and as I promised not to ask her to go again 
I am at a loss how to manage it - As Mrs. Lea 
can no longer see - but he could bring his mirror here if 
that would do.

2128   8157  I do not wish him to come here on 
account of the Guardian Spirit that 
attends him.

I do not know how to get over the difficulty unless 
you can open Mrs Leas Spiritual Eyes

2129 8152  I have no power over things, had 
I so, I might make him by force 
believe what I would try to do by 
conviction
had I that power I would not use it

I do not then know how I can arrange it

2130  8153  You can ask her Guardian Spirit 
to give her the power of Seeing but
157

You must do mentally.
but he careful above all things 
that you do not ask him to show 
her any other vision and that you
do not call any. 
Simply desire my appearance &
if that fails do not persist in it
once will be sufficient 
when you are ready to receive the 
Vision put your hand on the 
mirror
     Mentally ask Lero to enable 
Mrs. Lea to see the Vision that you
desire - then ask her inspect
the mirror without having told her
what you have done.

I returned thanks 
25' to 10 PM. 

                             Oval Mirror
              Requested J B to show the Book we
              last saw & continue the Comm'n
8154  2'
Heres the book again  its opening at the same place
Its quite plain
May I request you to turn the book so that my Seer
may copy the 2nd quarter of the book
Emma said the wheel in the Centre has turned round
on the little pivot
She then gives me the figures & signs & I completed
the other three sides - & at each quarter upon requesting
it the wheel turned round to enable her to read it
this occupied us an hour ---
10 30 PM  Action Ended. --
                see the wheel page 150
158

♂︎die  30 Nov.  1855, 8 PM.
                   Lero's Mirror
At Limehouse Mrs Charlotte Lea Spex.
I invoked agreeable to the CA's instruction, for half
an hour strongly & earnestly.  at the end of that
time  the mirror altho veiled -- had no vision
I requested Lero to inform me if we could have a 
Vision -

8155  In half an hour
You will I think regain your Vision
You will not see till then.

1/2 past 8
[9] PM.
                 Invoked again
After a lengthened & earnest mental Invocation
     The mirror veiled a beautiful light
appears.  Now the two top corners are very bright
its all gone thick  now there a figure but so
distant I can hardly see it -- there is some
reading  I cannot make it out  I can see the
figure has a bright light round the waist but
cannot see the face -- after some time Mrs.
Lea said       

8156     "God in his good time ----

but could not read the remd'r of the sentence
It remained a Considerable time & upon my
requesting the CA to appear plainer  the light
around the C. A become dazzlingly painful
The CA then left at the top side -
9:15 PM.
159

♂die  4 dec. 1855      C. A Mirror
                    Invoked the C. A.
I explained to the C A our want of success at Mr Lea's
on Friday evening

2131
8157  I wished, earnestly wished, to have given
Mr Lea instructions and advice for his
future welfare.
    Unless I could do so to himself it w.d
be of little use
    Mrs Lea will not regain her power of
Vision 

Mrs Lea has a niece   a Child about 11 Years old who
partially  Sees. Could Mrs Lea direct her faculty

2132
8158  I cannot tell unless I was near her.

May I "call" for Mr Lea next Friday week to see if
the child can see.

2133
8159   I have before said I shall more urgently
wish it now  - that you should not call
any more spirits in his mirror
     He has quite as much power for calling
them for visions of trial as you have.
I do not think it probable that he will
succeed for a long time neither do I
wish it so far as more visions are concerned
that excite curiosity, make amusement
or lend only to what is much worse
interest and ill gotten health. but
at the same time I earnestly pray
and am desirous of doing all that is
possible for the spiritual welfare of
Mr Lea.
I am desirous that one at
least should try first believe in
things far greater than this world
160

8159  can afford. and knowing as I do that 
in Gods Grace He makes the most 
inscrutable agency the means of enlightenment 
and guidance to his beloved 
people,  I have looked upon these things 
as the end by which he would be made 
a faithful follower of Christ.
     If I had accomplished this I 
should have left him, never to have 
appeared again or to have held Comm'n. 
with him in this world, for it is not 
his body or his mind as a man of earth 
that I love. but the immortal and the 
precious treasure within.

I explained at length my more than 20 years friendship 
with Mr Lea. - and asked if there was any harm in 
his Calling for his Young Seer to improve her vision

2134  8160  There is not

As to Calling or constraining

2135   8161  No It does not
I do not wish to be called on Tuesday W[?] 
but his Calling does not oblige me to 
appear.
I do so of my free Will.

I explained that my Seer declined going before that 
she had done so to please me, & that I could not 
ask her to go again - if the C.A had any method 
to propose

2136  8162  I have not I much wish to appear 
to him

I do not know any way than his bringing his 
mirror to Croydon. of getting over the difficulty

2137  8163   He must not come here

I do not know how to surmount the difficulty
161

2138   8164  You will do me the Justice of believing
that I only wish to appear  for his benefit 

I ret Thanks
If any &c.

2139   8165   When you next write to Robert Owen
tell him that I entertain the deepest 
respect for him, that I feel great 
sympathy for him and for his 
noble endevors [f]upon Earth - and 
that in sorrow I pray for his soul 
send him when published  a copy
of What is Truth.  tell him I trust
that he will see[t] in the simple
doctrine that it contains a later &
finer anchor of hope than the 
                  of one unknown God.

I ret'd thanks & explained as to the vision on        of
which I intended sending Mr Owen a copy

2140   8166  You are right

If I may &c

2141  8167  I have not this Evening.

Will you then please to favor me with the Vision

2142  8168  I will do so
May God bless you.

27' past 8 PM.
8169                      The Vision
     Now its veiled theres something coming all over it
it appears like fluted pillars white glossy looking pillars
covering the whole mirror but not straight up  but standing
like a timber roof only  so indistinct & so very White
Now its rising & getting more like an arch,
there seems to be such a dazzling light behind
it as rises, its very bright it seems to come from
a point at the back which is intensely bright
162

Now it has got to the top it is a perfect arch and 
the brightness of the light seems to come down as 
though above and beyond it, it looks so beautiful -
     There is a figure coming in at the top [*a*], its the 
Spirit which formed out of the water, I can tell 
it by the Cross before it, its much whiter and 
brighter than when it came out of the water. it 
is coming from where the light is brightest - it 
looks so sorrowful - it keeps on looking all 
round it, its put its right hand up to its head 
its dropped its hand. and turned right round 
with its back this way., the wing's towards 
us and the face towards the light - (this is 
the first time the back of a Spirit has ever being 
seen by Emma) Now theres some more figures 
coming in the light - the Spirit is coming nearer 
to you [*b*] & the other figures have come down (to A) 
they seem to come down in a shadowy cloud 
that hides the lower part of them, they dont 
seem to walk or fly as it were but to come 
down supported by the clouds, their wings 
are quite still - the Spirit raises his head 
& hands as though he was entreating them 
now they come nearer. but when they come 
together there is such a difference, the Spirit 
of the water who looked so beautiful by itself 
seems now so coarse in the form & dress to what 
the others do.
     It looks like the C.A coming down 
Yes it is the CA. he has got some thing carrying 
in his hand the CA has his crown & 
purple robes on - The CA's face is so white 
that your paper (this) looks almost black 
compared to it. its a book he has got in
163

his hand a large square one but very thin 
and the[y] covers are not stiff. they bend over 
as though it was only a paper cover its a very 
thin book, its leaves fly a very little way apart 
theres reading on the covers and although so 
small its beautifully printed so clear & distinct 
Now the water Spirit is taking it from the C.A. 
they are as far apart as ever they can be, to 
reach the book  the CA has hold of the book 
at the top. at arms length and the other 
hold of the bottom at arms length. now he 
has taken it away from the C.A. theres a little 
ring through the back at the top of the back 
and he has hung it on a little hook at the 
front of the Cross. If the printing was the right 
way upwards I could read it.
     Now the CA's going up towards 
the light behind the arch - now they are gone 
& the Spirit has turned this way - the book hangs 
straight before him - the reading is.

8170 
                               Metaphysical And Spiritual Philosophy 
                                                       Or The 
                                  Connection With And Influence Over 
                                                   Material Bodies 
                                                            By 
                                                          Spirit.

The cover is white like the whitest of white vellum 
the letters are black and all the words begin with 
capital letters - It is a beautiful clear white 
book. no gelding - the Spirits face is this way 
and the space around him is going up so as 
to make him look coming down - The arch
164
is gone out of Sight, its get darker & darker
now theres something coming at the bottom
a little peaked place like the top of a hill or
Mountain and the Spirit is going towards it
its folded its wings close together at its back
and sat down upon this peak.- its unhooked
the book from the Cross and turned it round
opened it and put it on its knees., its put its
hand to its head & the elbow just on the Edge
of the knee and pulled the book more this way
it sits sideways to me.   its all going - its 
quite Clear.
20' past 9 PM.

                      Oval Mirror
9 30. Called J. B to show the Continuation of
                    his Communication

Now the books Come  its open, theres sums in pencil
& ink all round the wheel.     7 . 726 . 713 . 7                                                      
Is it necessary to copy these
pencil figures 

8171  They are of no use being Calculations
of the separate people who were
engaged in it

Is it necessary then that I should have the
Horoscopes. which surround it

8172    It is necessary to put round the Wheel
the Horoscope of the persons who are
engaged in the games of Chance by
this you tell who will lose & win and
What will be the amount

Can you tell me the dates for which they are Calculated

and then I can[not] compute them at my leisure
as my Seer is not acquainted with Astrological 
Signs - 

8173   This is a copy of Joseph Balsamos
he calculated before the times, but
the names of the parties engaged
will answer the same purpose.

Emma then furnished me with all the outer
figures  Actually belonging to the Wheel as on
the opposite side - when finished I said
will you turn over the leaf unless you wish to
give me any information first.
     Now theres another leaf turned over
Theres pictures of dice theres 4 dice theres a
red line curled round the page - at the bottom
theres a glass bowl. with a red liquor in it
1/2 way up., theres a line or cone drawn through
it and a dice in the middle - the half of the
dice in the liquor looks like pearl the other half
like Ivony. 

8174   Theres 4 more dice at the top
(see the drawing at the back).
they are 1. 4. 2. 3. - they have reading under
them.

8175 "  The lowest number must be put in the
solution that will make your
opponent lose - 
the lowest number being heavy of course
cannot turn up.

Theres a pack of Cards in the Middle, theres 
two hands under the cards got hold of them
as it were -

8176   "This is for winning unfairly in throwing
[Illustration]

The lowest number must be put in 
the solution, that will make your 
opponent lose - the lowest number 
being heavy of course cannot turn
up.
166

dice you can throw any number you 
please by making the reverse side of 
the dice heavy, and that without ever 
being in any way discovered

Now the book's short is gone clear
Have you any further observation to make

8177 No

Will you continue next Tuesday

8178  Yes

20' past 10 PM   Ended.

                 ♂︎die 11th. Dec'r. 1855. C.A. Mirror
8 PM                 Invoked the C.A.

May I ask if there is any objection to my calling 
Orion & other spirits into my other mirrors & crystals & 
receiving information from them.

2143  8179   No harm arises from your [doing] seeing him 
or recieving his communications
     But harm would arise from it if you 
allowed yourself to be influenced by his 
opinions and advice
     He is little better than an Evil 
Spirit he mixes with them himself and 
delights in leading others into their 
company but his principles & opinions 
are too dearly expressed and too much 
opposed to all sense of right and truth 
that must exist in the hearts of all 
who would not willingly err, to obtain 
reliance or trust.

I explained

2144  8180   I do not wish you to call one Spirit 
exclusively when you have a chance of 
calling and seeing others of every grade 
In Spirts as in Man you can only
167

judge from their appearance, their 
actions and their communications and 
if the whole is consistent and perfect 
to your standard of excellence, then 
you do them as with man only justice 
in believing them good
     I will answer your questions 
concerning the revelations of St. John

I read the 3rd Chapter.

2145  8181 //  John makes the same mistake here 
as in the former ones, his whole 
description of Christ speaking is written 
as though it were the description of 
Christ given by himself to be transferred 
to the Church.
     I think myself the doctrines 
in those Chapters is quite spoiled by 
the manner in which it is given
     The whole of the revelation is 
written the same and I look upon it 
the same as the dreams of Swedenborg 
A good man holding communication 
with Christ by means which in a 
waking state he cannot fully 
understand or rather the impression 
being perfect on his mind he cannot 
make those understand to whom he 
would give it                                           //

I read the 4th Chapter

2146  8182   The description is very peculiar 
it is inconceivable that a door sh'd 
open in the Heavens where space is 
without limit without division or 
without restraint - It is also impossible
168

that living creatures in the likeness of 
monsters, worse than any animals 
created in nature should be in the very 
presence of God because if this is taken 
with faith - you cannot consistently deny 
the existence of Souls in Animals, for 
without a Soul there would be nothing 
saved, and if at the end of all things 
in a place where the greatest of souls 
would be seen, Animals are there 
saved and placed it must be by the 
intercession of Jesus for their Souls
     Or if in another light these animals 
are considered as symbolical signs 
for what purpose could the maker 
and commander of every thing beautiful 
have monsters in his presence such 
as the description given by John - 
that they really exist there it is absurd 
to believe.

I read the 5th Chapter

2147  8183  That Chapter is a perfect transcription [*?*] 
of Johns writing and in the beginning 
of it there is an error which cannot 
be passed over -
     On the book being produced with 
7 seals he states that he wept 
because there was no man found 
worthy of opening it.
     Now in a spiritual world where 
he is the only mortal - and he says 
that he went in spirit - in a place 
where no Soul even could enter unless 
redeemed, and cleansed & purified 
a book is produced in the very hands 
of the Almighty God, and no man 
is found worthy of opening it.
169

It implies that the book could not 
be opened by God himself and that 
by some means a trial was made 
among men.  for if no trial was 
made how could it be found that they 
were unable to open it - and if man 
in his mortal state - and the mortal 
state is man - could not be as a 
man in the presence of his maker 
and in the Spirit World, - then that 
book must have been sent to man 
on Earth, and he being unable to 
open it - Man the image of his 
Maker with the Divine Spirit within 
him and the influence of God over 
him being found unworthy of opening 
the book, - the task devolves on one 
much beneath the state of man 
one of the Animals -
          Do you see the Error

I explained re-read Verse 13.

2147  8184   It is the truthful dreams of a Man 
I cannot see the good of publishing 
them - More than this I cannot 
see the sense of believing them for 
in the last verse that you mention 
there is another great inconsistency
     John being in heaven & in the 
presence of the Spirits - hears, (that is 
a mortal faculty) - the living creatures 
on the Earth the fishes, and the birds, 
and the Insects proclaim the praise 
of God. - Now this is utterly 
impossible and must seem so to a 
Mortal - And if you pass over 
that - and believe that he heard the
[*170*] Spirits of these Animals & fishes speak 
you not only allow that they have 
a spiritual existence, but that they 
have reason, and not only reason 
but a soul - and faith in one 
particular Creed, by which that soul 
can be everlastingly saved by 
recognizing with praise and worshipp'g 
God they must condemn [*?*] by reason 
other idols and worship him because 
they find him more powerful, more 
truthful, and the true God.

I read Chapter 6.

[*8185 2149*] I do not wonder at Controversy for 
who can understand that which 
does not exist.

John calls that a book which 
on the Seals being opened - sends 
forth - not tokens of peace and 
good will among men, but death 
destruction.

Recollecting that this comes 
from the highest source of all, that 
it is to take place at the last when 
the world is again void and the 
human soul is made divine

Can it be possible that these 
pictures from a book, should have 
an influence that the [?] God 
has not, - that Chapter contains 
within itself that which levels it 
with the Earth, - it seems to me 
more like the wanderings of an 
insane mind, than the real description 
of even a vision of things that will 
not exist until the world ends

And then how far different
[*171*]

from that which he describes

In one thing in that Chapter 
he alone is right - Spiritual books 
exist - they have done so from the 
beginning and will continue to the 
End. [*page 178*]

I ret'd. thanks

If any &c.

[*8186 2150*] You will see the end of the vision 
if you desire it tonight, that has 
been continued for some time.

We will with your kind permission do so and 
defer our Communication from Balsamo till next 
Tuesday Evening.

[*8187 2151*] The book which you have seen in 
the hands of the Spirit is mine.

Having been ordained through 
his own merits into the higher order 
of Spirits he returns with a mission 
to Earth, that is, to be the guardian 
& protector of Men, and good purposes 
and to exercise a pure and holy 
influence over those willing to receive 
the word of God, but the task was 
a difficult one and on entering upon 
his duties, he found apparently the 
same insurmountable obstacles 
that a man would do on first 
entering into Communication with the 
Spirit World, and it was necessary 
for his Guidance and instruction 
that he should have an explanation 
of the Connection between Mind & 
Matter. - Material & Spirit - Body 
and Soul, before he could perfectly 
discharge his duties to those above 
or below him

I have loved to contemplate
172

that subject in all its different bearings
and connections, my knowledge & conclusions
I placed together and gave him
I believe  that to others besides
himself it would be instructive and
interesting. - If you desire it at a 
future time you can see it.

I explained my wishes at length.
 
2152  8188  I believe it is best to finish one
subject before you begin another
The Vision  You can see concluded
tonight.
You can then continue the memoirs
of Balsamo and when I have
given a further explanation of the
Vision I will then show you the
contents of the book. --

1/4 to  10 PM.  The C A left. 

                 The Vision
8189  Now its thick  theres the peak of the mountain
come and the spirit sitting on it with the book
open.  in white,  his wings folded up, now he's closing
the book, he shut it up, I can see the cover
it seems so strange that all the words begin with
Capital letters, now he is standing up with his
wings unfolded, now he's going off the mountain
is going up  he appears as tho coming down,  now
I can see the tops of some trees -- now its come
steady  its sand and gravel under his feet
and all the trees round -- now the trees are
going (from left to right)  the spirit does not
seem to tread on the Earth  it keeps passing
like a [lashy?] wind sometimes wider and then
narrower  they look like fir trees & some with
[*173*]

tall thin stems with a few very large leaves at 
the top

Now it has stopped still theres a 
very large round sandy place all bare, no trees 
the trees are at a distance the Spirit stands in the 
middle theres something coming from him all 
over his head and all round him like a vapor 
now theres little images of himself coming not like 
him with the cross they come out in all directions 
like little images theres two or three out of his 
head and others in different parts in the vapor 
theres 4 round the lower part - 5 on the wings 
side, 3 round his arm, 3 in front of him 
theres 2 in his neck 4 round the head he is 
standing sideways, I cannot see what are on 
the other side they are very little images, he 
has still got the Book in the front of the Cross 
the Images have all come down to one place 
in front of him & facing the Cross they are going 
a double [?], now theres some coming from the 
other side Theres 6 more that makes 27 they 
are in two rows

The Cross on the Spirit comes from the 
band round the neck, to a little below the girdle 
of stones round the waist - The Spirit appears 
about a foot long and the Images ab't 4 inches 
they keep moving the trees keep going back. 
Now they are spreading out in different direct'ns 
and as they spread out he gets higher up 
hes gone right up above them they keep quite 
level, he rises above them going over their heads 
he goes slanting & head first now hes quite 
laying down (horizontal) as tho flying his wings 
are spread out, his dress and the clouds and 
all keep going onwards, he's getting a great 
way above them, he has almost got to the 
top of the glass - and the place where the 
images are is getting thick I can scarcely see
[*174*]

them, it is quite clear where the spirit is now 
I cant see them at all, the Spirit is at the top 
of the glass as though flying with his face 
down, in the thick mist below there's some 
lines coming across just like those I saw at first

(see opposite)

[*No 1. 8190*] In the first is a very large building 
something like Saint Pauls, it has a 
dome. theres a sheet close against it 
I can see all the little people carts & 
carriages., theres steps go up to the door 
and a good many people come down 
the steps and in among the people 
theres one of the little images, he came 
so curious in amongst them and from 
the Spirit above there comes a little 
line of white like a stream or line of 
fluid - its round & all the way the same 
size. - it goes from the Spirit down 
to the little image

[*No 2. 8191*] Theres the Sea all blue waves, green 
waves, no blue waves, all white foam 
on the top of each wave its dreadful 
rough. theres such a pretty little 
ship toppling about it - its so 
dark all round it - Oh it lightens 
in the dark cloud - & then you see the 
Ship so plain, it looks so pretty 
you can see the reflection of the 
lighting on the water. - it looks so nice 
now theres a little image come with 
the red cross., hes popped in from the 
top of the Ship - right on the highest 
part & stopped as it went down the 
side of the woodwork (the mast) I 
can see him standing on the Shipboard 
& he has a ray or line from
[*175*]

the Spirit at the top, now the sea 
is getting so much calmer, theres no 
lightning, the ship seems to have 
got steady. - that is all there is 
there -

[*No 3 8192*] I dont know what that is, it is 
such a dark hole a lot of men in it 
its not a room, because it has got 
a round rough top - it dont look as 
tho it was built, theres such strange 
things on the wall, swords crossed 
2 or 3 pairs - little holes in the 
walls and things in them as though 
they were stuffed in - & put out. 
2 or 3 little old duty flags, terribly 
torn right at the end theres a 
picture hangs up in a very handsome 
carved wood frame thats the only 
tidy thing in the place. theres one 
man sitting just under the picture 
with his cloak under him, he's 
got a long grey beard; black gown 
on, black velvet cap. - theres another 
standing at the side leaning against 
the wall, hes dressed something like 
an Englishman his hands in his 
trousers pocket his legs crossed & his 
back against the wall - a very long 
waistcoat on split up at the sides 
he's got a black velvet cap on. no 
beard or moustachios a little man 
with such a sharp nose & piercing 
little eyes, just over his head is 
a skull nailed or stuck to the 
wall. - then theres a little piece 
of something in the middle for 
the Table, its no shape theres -
[*176*]

Something on it - the table and the 
seats round look as though cut 
out of the rock. the table in the 
middle has a flat top theres two 
men sitting against it - the seats 
seem part of the rock or cave.

The picture over the old mans 
head has painted on it - (see opposite) 
theres reading at the bottom, it begins 
with R ---- its only one word I 
cannot make it out -

Its changing there's a little 
man coming on the top of the 
Table and such lots of little lights 
glimmer out of him and a line 
of fluid comes down - I can see it 
come down as it were

[*No 4 8193*] Theres one man sitting at a table 
in a glass room, the shape of a bell 
he's got a table, and a great many 
books on the floor, and piled up 
round him, he's got little holes 
out of the house and telescopes 
go through it - theres 3 Globes a 
large one a middling sized one & a small 
one he sits there, theres a little 
man comes down on to the table 
right into the books & a little pipe 
is come down to him.

[*No 5 8194*] Theres a room hung with black 
and a black Coffin on Tressels 
and Silver plats on it - theres candles 
coming, and the little man sitting 
on the top of the Coffin his wings 
foled up & his hands crossed 
before him -
[*177*]

[*No 6 8195*] Theres six children, one quite a 
baby the biggest is a good sized 
girl they dont look as though 
they belonged to each other, one is 
so dirty and ragged and another 
so smart - the baby is so pretty 
with a coral and a laced cap.

Theres a poor half starved boy 
so cold and ragged and dirty the 
biggest boy has a gold watch, in his 
dirty hands, & dirty greasy cap on, 
he is making all sorts of antics, 
his face looks swollen. he has got 
a scar or cut on his face. and the 
next is a boy in little jacket and 
trousers and white waistcoat with 
big hat on his head and a little 
bunch of flowers in his button hole 
and theres the little man - & the 
[?] a line & all the little lights 
dart out to each child

Its all gone

10' to 11 PM

[?]de 18th. Dec. 1855. C A Mirror

7h.15 PM. Invoked the C A

In white purple robe - crown &c.

As next Tuesday Evening is Christmas day may I ask 
if it will be agreeable to you to appear - the Evening before 
or the Evening after

[*8196 2153*] I will tell you before I leave.

As my friend Henry Lea is so unfortunate in these 
mysteries may I ask if it would be advisable for 
him to change his Guardian Spirit & if so &c.

[*8197 2154*] From the unsettled & undecided state 
he is in at present. I think no higher 
Spirit would adhere to him.
[*178*]

The Spirit who shows the visions of the 
remains of Joseph Balsamo's life wishes 
you to know that he will continue them 
on any Evening you may wish he being 
unable to do so this Evening

Knowing this and knowing also 
that a time of rejoicing is at hand, I 
will give you something by which you 
might bear in mind my sincere wishes 
for your welfare and happiness - Your 
instruction and advancement in knowledge 
I feel I cannot do any thing you will 
receive more kindly, than to give you 
this -

The C.A. has  the book in his hand. 
I ret'd thanks

[*8198 2155*] I will give it you this Evening after I have 
answered your questions & on another 
Evening I will finish it -

Shall I then postpone the reading of the Apocalypse. & receive 
your esteemed communication

[*8199 2156*] there is time for both

I read Revelations Chapter 7.

[*8200 2157*] It is perfectly impossible to take it in a 
literal sense, and it is even more 
impossible to receive it only as a figurative 
speech - All those who read it must 
surely recognize in it only the wanderings 
and dreams of a mind wrought to a 
state of - (?) by religious conjectures

If you look upon it in this 
light the only one in which it can 
reasonably be received - it is easily accounted 
for. - there are [more] no people more 
truly insane than religious fanatics 
on every other subject they may be reasonable 
& open to conviction
[*179*]

[*8200*] But if once a man is persuaded of 
one particular dogma in religion, no 
matter how absurd or how utterly 
inconsistent with truth as a whole he 
clings to it with his whole strength & 
from it he builds a giant creed - he 
forms fancies without foundation, on 
the most intricate subjects, and he 
dreams until those Ideas become 
unto him realities of things utterly 
impossible - putting such faith in 
his own convictions & those convictions 
arising in his own mind without any 
relation to the views of any other men 
or any written record, he naturally 
believes himself to be superior to them 
to look upon himself as a prophet 
and as one having a power that they 
cannot command. -

And so Saint John dreamt 
and so have men dreamt since & 
yet these are good men, men true & 
sane on any other subject, than the 
one ruling them. - 

Surely Religion is powerful in its 
simplicity to cause such dissension 
among men.

May I observe that my seer sees this evening with 
difficulty - does it arise from [possibly?] the position of 
the mirror

[*8201 2158*] They appear as plain as they have done

I read Chapter 8.

[*8202 2159*] That chapter is supposed to describe 
the end of the world. how [holy/hardly?] 
different that scene will be
[*8202*] John makes it a scene of torture & of [*180*]
suffering, and of horrors--
Is it not for God to believe
that he could torture those remaining
on Earth at the last day in the manner
described. There is no doubt that the
Second Coming of the Son of God will
take place without notice long before
to men. The signs of his coming will
be subtle only as his progress is made
and the [Colon?] and happy influence of
his [love?] will not make those then existing
upon Earth. suffer death by flames
or death in a sea of blood - neither
will they be scorched and dried up by
fire without even their knowledge. Without
there being able in the least even to ask
for Salvation their souls will be harried
before a tribunal as with Justice could
only punish their guilt.
Taking the meaning of that Chapter
in its mildest sense it would seem
that God is desirous to catch man in 
their wickedness that they might be
punished for it - that he is watching
to destroy them.  For in recognizing him
as all seeing, you must believe him
to be aware what is existing among
his Creation - at the time he chooses
to destroy them. And if he takes
them without notice and destroys them
in the state he finds them in 
of what use is the Second Coming of 
the Son.
No the God of [?] is not
watching to destroy his people but to
save them - and when he sees that 
the time is come that those on Earth
[*181*] 

have among them the true light of the 
Gospel - for the sake of his Son - for 
the sake of the ten who have preached 
his word, shall the million be saved

And again John makes the angel 
of God the messenger of Terror - he makes 
them do that by visible process, and 
that process revolting - the same thing 
the invisible hand of God could accomplish 
calmly & unseen. the Transformation 
of the Earth.

Is it not more consistent to believe 
that his Angels are in his presence. 
[waiting with him] waiting with him to 
recieve those that his Son shall make 
acceptable, and that at the same time 
he through his own power, the same 
power that created the Earth. should 
return it to the Void from which he 
brought it -

May I &c

[*8203 2160*] Yes

I read Chapter 9.

[*8204 2161*] Do you not think that that Chapter 
is too revolting to be one of the same 
record in which Jesus Christ when 
dieing upon the Cross with his last 
breath. prays

"Father forgive them for they know not 
what they do." - ?

Passing over the slighter errors for I 
cannot conceive how John after describing 
the being which he does of many
182
forms as coming from the bottomless
spirit - can call it a locust - surely
there is no likeness between that
Animal and his description - this is
a trifle compared to the tenor of the
whole.
I will call your attention to the
part in which he speaks of these
forces of Evil tormenting the human
beings whom God has let fall into
their hands knowingly for five
months.
If any thing can justify
the assertion of all clergyman that
many millions is too small a
Calculation for the number of the
Everlastingly damned this is it.

If &c

2162
8205
If you wish to read another Chapter
I will answer it.

I read Chapter 10

2163
8206
This Chapter seems almost absurd
The part which John assigns to
himself during all these proceedings
is a very prominent one. - In the
Character of a Mortal he cannot be
on Earth and in heaven - Speaking
to those about the throne - and Eating
(this shows he must have been in 
the mortal state.) The book presenting
to him by the Angel standing on the 
Sea & Earth. For what use could he
swallow the book - or how could he
taste it both sour & bitter - and if
he did eat if for what possible use
could it have been done.
"Spirit is universal life and from that springs every thousand quality"
I said my Seer is not able to read the following  words will you
please to render them plainer

2165  [?] &c.
It cannot for a moment be received as [* 183*]
                       an account of what will actually take 
                       place - to believe in it you must deny
                        entirely every principle of true religion
                        And if you do deny consistency and truth
                        for the dark and uncertain men of 
                        imagination what do you gain by 
                        the exchange. probably nothing
                        for in the whole course of that revelation 
                         there is nothing that man can receive
                          no foundation for reasonable faith
                          there is no way provided out even if
                          leading him to the distinction of being
                          one of those marked by the Angel
                          to escape the Destroyer.
I ret a thanks.

The CA is here in white, purple robe, crown, wings
as usual.
May I request you to continue this Evening your
much valued communication contained in your
Treatise on Metaphysical & Spiritual philosophy
2170   I will do so
8214   Have you any questions first
I have not. &c.

Emma commenced reading the Cont.n of page 2.
2172
8216
"And what a perfect spiritual life
there exists in Every man &c. down to

This being the bottom of the page. I requested
to read page 3. And the leaf appeared to turn
of itself slowly over.— this was repeated to pages
299 Vividenborgo. H&H. It hath also been given me to know whence
man derives, anxiety, grief of mind, melancholy, 
there are spirits who are not as yet in conjunction
with Hell, because as yet they are in their first state
-- There spirits love things indigested and maligning 
such as one those of filthy meals in the stomach.
Wherefore they are present when they can find rich
things appealing to man, because those things
are delightful to them, and they their discourse with
each other from their own evil affection. The affections
of their discourse flows - in thence with man - which
affection if it be contrary to the mans affection excites
melancholy, sadness, and anxiety - but if it be agreeable 
to the mans affection it excites in him gladness and
cheerfulness. --

These spirits appear near the stomach some to
the right, some to the left -- nearer their remote --
that hence arises anxiety of mind from cosined of
from much experience - I have seen them, have
heard them, have been sensible of anxieties occasioned
by them. Have discoursed with them - they have been
driven away, and the anxiety cleared, they have returned
and the anxiety returned. And I perceived it to increase
and decrease according to their approximation and
removal. --

You 
Your remark in the treatise we have just read reminds
me of a former response I received from you Some
time Since, on Swedenborgs Assertion of the same fact
& from Certain reasons I &c. _
2174
I understand you but you are quite wrong
8218
You would not willingly recieve those
evil spirits and believe me that
unwillingly they cannot come.
Natural causes bring about the same
results as they do , they seek not the presence
of those who have a firm will or the
vestige of a true faith
Your remark leads me to one
that you will pardon me for mentioning
even if it pains you. my reason for
wishing you to discontinue your Communicatn.
with the spirits of Mr Lea's Crystal or
Mirror, to keep as much as possible
away from him, and him from your
house. was for the reason that I am
Quite certain one or more of these Spirits
are attached to him — that having an
impaired digestion as you have, they
would strike hard, to gain a mastery
over you. but although I have no doubt
You would resist them. and I have
Also confidence in myself, still I am
certain that the struggle. would do
you much harm.
About 4 years past I mesmerised the wife of a
friend and circumstances arose out of it which
[*3*]

Caused me great anxiety, she is now again ill 
& wishes to be mesmerised - this I dare not do, may 
I ask your advice

[*2175 8219*] Cannot she be mesmerised professionally 
I think that mesmerism would do her 
good even if practised by her husband 
but on no account whatever would I 
give my consent to your mesmerising any 
one again - I insist upon this forcibly 
because whatever amount of good you 
do to the party suffering, you do twice 
as much harm to yourself.

This is the evening of the first day of a new year 
may I be &c.

[*2176 8210*] God grant so long as I am able to 
give you information and instruct'n. either 
for your temporal or spiritual state 
it may not be witheld, I desire your 
happiness in this world and the next 
I intercede and I pray for you and by 
the merits of the redeemer may it be 
available - your happiness in this world 
I would do all I could towards perfecting 
and the greatest happiness can only be 
attained by a fervent faith in God 
in his Mercy, and his Love, and a 
faith in things made evident thro' the 
words of his Son. - and I fervently 
wish you many happy years of 
happiness, of pleasure, and of joy

The CA's gone 10 past 10 PM.
Tue. [?] Jan 1856 8 TM CR Mirror 4
Invoked the CA.
8211
The CA appeared but very indistinctly, the veil appears
so thick in front of mirror - the answers to my
questions appeared but Emma was totally unable to
read them on my palm. The book then appeared in 
the CA's hands who kindly brought it close up to the
front of the mirror but even then Emma could not
read any portion of the CA's response underneath
I then mentioned that my seer had just met with
a great dissappt. as a [journey?] she had contemplated to visit
some friends who also suffering from nervous [dull?] ache
and I requested the CA to defer the vision in the book
until the following Tuesday (15th Jan) as requested
I have a vision without reading- Well as he left
with the book I [?] requesting a vision There came
individually a response and- at the end of it my
oval mirror- Emma could not read the response but
upon getting the thing and opening it- Emma inspected
it without altering her seat. by leaning it against
the wall-just under the [Catt??wood?]?]. And presently
she said-
Here is yourself Coming
How are you this evening
8212 he nods his head
Why have you come uncalled are you the "Interesting
instinctive vision"  I requested
I am obliged to take an opportunity of
appearing- and come when I can you
8213 never ask me.
I cannot appear in the other mirror
but when there is no vision I can tell you
is shown you when you can see me.
Was it you then that caused this mirror to appear
just not with some reading we could not make out
8214 I caused it to be gone.
5

Can you tell me how it is my seer can send your
answers & yet could not read in the other mirror

8215 
I suppose because I am not so purely
spiritual -ha-ha:-

I have received from the CA some valuable spiritual
information I hope you also have profited by it [their]

8216
You are a Prodigy
If you are as fond of telling others what
You tell me and circulate the reports of
receiving such wonderful information you
are quite entitled to one of those paragraphs
in the newspaper headed.
"wonderful if true"

I am going to publish the book this month, I hope
you will be a subscriber and benefit by the contents
Can you lend me ten pounds for a month or two.

8217
I could tell you how to get it- at least
a friend of mine could
He can appear in a bottle of water
and have a diamond at the bottom
worth a great deal more than that

I presume you have got that from my former queries
relating to Count St Germaine's obtaining diamonds
by the ____

8218
Well I can tell you the spirit that can
do it, and the form for making him do
so - at least I can cause you to know it
shall I?

Yes
now hes gone
Now he has come back by himself (27' to 9PM)

8219
I wish you to cover up the other [mirror?]

I did so

8220
You must request the CA to keep away
now you have covered it up

No I cannot do that

8221
Whilst he is near I cannot show you
what I intended
6
But cannot you appear on any night except
Tuesdays - cannot you appear on Fridays
[*8222*] I could do it if I chose.
Then why don't you choose
[*8223*] because you put me off to suit the convenience
of others that appear.
You know Tuesdays are devoted to my receiving infm 'n
and instruction from the CA
[*8224*] If you liked you might ask the CA to let
me appear in that one I don't like coming
in the smallest.
You know this is a beautiful mirror I might say
faultless --
I have got something in my pocket that
[*8225*] Orion gave me to show you but I cannot
do so unless I appear in the C A mirror
and the CA is absent. It is something
very interesting
You must be aware that the CA mirror is consecrated
to him and entirely under his protecting charge
therefore I cannot do it -  besides I don't believe your
tale about the diamonds-
[*8226*] I don't want you to believe me you are
the only loser by it
I explained
[*8227*] Well then if you will remove it from
the wall it is against and from the Mirror
I will show you what I have in my
pocket.
Emma then placed the gilt mirror on the table P.
inspected it he continuing in the mirror, he had his
hand all the time in his side coat pockets - Emma
remarked - he looks about so carefully - now he is
taking out something like a silk pocket hand'f - rolled
up out of his pocket - he's undoing it - There looks
like a great black beetle in it - it is such a horrid
black thing, it's not a beetle, but so dreadfully

Is that your interesting black diamond you have got
there.

8228  No but I will have him here and from
him you can ascertain how to get the
real ones.

But what may I ask is the Gentlemans name you
are learning

8229  He will himself have the pleasure of
informing You.

Emma said  Now you are gone.
Will you tell me what name I am to address you by

8230 -----

Of what kind or order of Spirits are you.
Now he's getting so much larger  he's nearly as large
as the Mirror -
Can you tell me the formula for obtaining diamonds
in [O?] .B.

8231  I can bring them into a Vessel of water
if you can send other spirits away that
are around.

I cannot do that this Evening but if you will appoint 
another Evening, it can be done - besides I have not
got my O [M?] ready this Evening. 

8232  There is no time like the present

If you have the power you describe, it seems strange
such simple things should prevent you.

8233  What are simple things
I can only deposit a diamond in water
because I belong to Water - but I
cannot even do that unless you

dispel the influence which now I feel
very strong.
I cannot do that— I cannot dispel my own Guardian
Spirit —
8234
Would you dispel it on another Evening
willingly.
No. but on another evening you could appear without
my having Called him
8235
That is not what I ask.
Call or not his Influence is the same
and when I am with you that influence
is opposed to me.
Then I am afraid I must go without my diamond
as I would not willingly place myself from under
his Care and guidance
8236
Would you if I could point out to you
One more powerful and as faithful
I could not obtain a more faithful GS. and
above all he gives me that knowledge which I
covet above all the Diamonds of the Deep.
8237
then if I come as this Antagonist
You will receive me willingly
No Not as his Antagonist
8238
You will let me appear without exorcism
then.
Only when I Invoke You
What shall be the formula when I call
8239
My name alone will bring me.
I am nearly always attached to a
friend of yours
Will you tell me his name:
8240 Mr. - - -
By what means are you attached to him he has
no Seer—that can See —  and he professes to have
no wish to Call Evil spirits.—
8241
You will find me there only when
you may call me and plenty of others
besides —
he's gone 10' past [10] 9 PM

now you are Comback.
Well you seem to have a respectable lot of acquaintances
Where did you get - - - - from.

8242  Thats my pocket Companion and guide
for 1856.

He may bring you some "Atmospheric" diamonds
but I doubt very much his bringing me real 
substantial diamonds that will --. have you
found out the [Palingeriesin?] of plants yet

8243  I knew it before you did

It seems to me strange that these things can
only be done by Evil Spirits

8244  They are not Evil

What do you then call the Gentleman thats just
left.

8245  I call him Good

Can you give me any reason why that Spirit is
attached to my friend.
Now he's turned round & walked off.

7 PM.
May I &c

8246  2177   do so

I explained at length our action of last Tuesday Evening

2178   8247   When a spirit appears in your mirror unless
You have called him with the proper form.
You should use Exorcism. 
     The appearance of the Spirit on last
Tuesday Evening must have shown that he 
was Evil, I would not willingly have Evil
appear and I tried to prevent it, but 
however I rejoice that no Evil has been 
done although from his own words
The Count de St. Germain
Count St Germaine played a distinguished part at the Court of Louis XV
His real name or birthplace has never been discovered - He was a
Rosicrucian & revealed he had the power of drawing diamonds from
the earth and pearls from the sea by the force of his incantations
He was an Alchymist - & made the Elixir -- & laid claim to
having lived several centuries -- He lived in great magnificence
& made most costly presents to the Ladies of the Court.  The King
looked upon him with marked favor  was often closeted with 
him for hours together, and would not suffer any one to
speak disparagingly of him. --  How he obtained his vast
wealth remains a secret.  "There appears no doubt that
he possessed the secret of removing spots from Diamonds".
He died at Sleswig under the roof of his friend the Prince
in the year 1784.
See Memoirs of Madame de Hausset. & also
                          & also Chas Mackay's  popular delusions - 1852

you must have judged his intentions if he
were able to gain the ascendancy over you.
He stated truly that he was attached to [Mr]

_ _ _ _ _  is the same spirit that procured
the diamonds for Count Saint Germaine and
Joseph Balsamo.

Yet I cannot conceive why _ _ _ _ _ sh'd be attached to my
friend [/////] as he professes to have no wish to call Evil Spirits

2179  8248   [/////] has great interest in the lives of
 those men and of course the spirit clings
to the remembrance.

I explained and said I could not conceive the reason for my
atmospheric double being apparently so much under the
influence of those spirits

2180  8249  He is as you were once desirous of magical
Information and power unmindful perhaps
of spiritual good, but it does not make
any difference his actions do no harm
to any one for his spiritual life ends
without any judgment hereafter

I have rec'd the proofs of the answer to Echo  but Mr.
Chapman has had it printed in such an ugly type
that I intend only having half the number printed it
will  I hope be ready for distribution amongst my
friends in about a fortnight or 3 weeks.

2181 8250  What will be the expense of it altogether

It has cost 10 pounds at present but if advertised will
cost 4 or 5 pounds more.

2182  8251    If you could manage so as not to
lose any thing by it.

I was aware at first that whatever its cost, it must be
so the expense & if it had been printed well I should have
been quite satisfied -- will you now kindly favor me
with a Continuation of your work on Spiritual
Philosophy

2183  8252  I will do so
The leaves will turn over if you request
11
them and if you desire me I will appear
again.

1/2 past 7
The books here & the CA is leaving  Now the book is
opening very slowly - the Reading begins at the top 
of the page.
      My Seer here observed that the lines of words
in the Book appeared most minute yet  beautiful but 
not in English Characters or Language – but that as it 
appeared in English for her to read the words seemed 
to encrease in size & Change their form a few words at 
a time into our modern print & were then read by her
The Seer was still suffering from Nervous face ache
which was some hindrance to her reading readily 
Now it has commenced

2184   8253  I have said in all things Created there is 
life &c - down to Exists in Man himself.

Mr [Gen?] Danson of Birm'm  is to lecture at Croydon on next
Tuesday as I much wish My Seer to hear him, may
I ask you to allow me to have the book on another Eveng
so that I might not lose an Evening by her going

2185   8254 I am sorry that I cannot appear except
on Tuesday until after the end of Feb'y.

May I ask as my Seer is still suffering, if we may
See Mr. Anderson in our Oval Mirror this Evening

2186  8255  There is no objection to Your calling him
I cannot tell whether he will appear.

If any &c.

2187  8256  I have not this Evening 

1/4 to 9 PM. The CA left.

9 PM.          Called Mr. Anderson.          Oval Mirror
Now hes come black Coat  dark trousers  he appears
very old to what he used to do 
Good Eveng  Mr A.   We are indeed pleased to see you
12
I hope you are quite well
Yes, thank you. How have you fared Since we last saw
You in the mirror
8257
I have been at Bristol since October

Then you left the Crimea on "urgent private Business."
8258
O very , its no use being out there in the
winter time they are doing nothing
Of course if I thought they had been going
to fight I should have stopped.
I dont want to eat the puddings that
have been mauled about by so many so I
came home.

May I ask how Miss Georgina is
8259
My sister

Yes
8260
She is very well,

how have you got on with your Crystal & Magical
operations
8267
I cant get on very well, I believe I have
told you before that mine is a very small
Crystal, and when I use a mirror or
even a bottle of water I cannot control
the spirits when they appear—and when
they appear in the Crystal they are very
small and I can scarcely read.
When they appear in the Mirror
Altho I do not desire it they are often
Evil and when they are Evil and appear
often the consequences are terrible.

May I ask who is now your Guardian Spirit
8262
Constantine

When Evil Spirits appear why do you not Exorcise
8263
I do use it , and they go away but
they come again immediately after
when they keep on Appearing in various
frightful forms it quite unnerves me.

I explained how to get a New Mirror made So
as to prevent their Appearing.
13
Should I then be able to keep it to 
one spirit alone. 

Yes, &c

8264    but then he would very seldom appear and 
be unable to give me the information I 
required.

I am going to print a little Pamphlet this month 
Shall I send you a copy.

8265    What is it called

"Echo" what is Truth? in answer to a work on deism 
entitled "What is Truth."

8266   By an Anonymous author from Maddox [?]

Yes 

8267    Who is your publisher the same 

Yes  John Chapman. 

8268   When will it be published 

This month

8269   Where can they be had after that time 

thro any bookseller

8270   Is your address & your name in them.
 
My address is. Have you seen Robert Owen the Philanthropists 
New Existence & his Correspondence relative to Spiritual 
manifestations 

8271   I have not

I had a friend offer to bring me a diamond & leave it
in my D.B. but he is an evil Spirit of the Deep. 

8272   You never refused did you

I do not intend to let him do so tho'

8273   Why not.
You have no occasion to have any thing 
more to do with him after you have 
received it

 Why you seem to think evil spirits are like the
Giants in Jack the Giant Killer, the bigger the Giant 
the bigger fool they were . - to suppose they would be 
duped so Easily.

8274   I think man has more power than 
Spirits and that by the Exercise of his
14

Well he can separate himself from them 
yes but they generally require a sacrifice, and altho
the object may in itself be [vile] of little estimation. yet
we are so ignorant of what constitutes the Vital
Principle - that I should hesitate before I deprived any
living animal of the life which God has given it - to offer
it as a sacrifice to a Spirit of Evil.

8275    Certainly, but there are formulas that
only require to be traced or even the name
of the Spirit to be written in blood - that
is You might prick Yourself and write
with that.
     do you carry your objections so far
as to consider that life exists in the
blood when that exists in so small a
Quantity.

Yes, by so doing   You of your own free act, give them
a power of  mobilizing  you  if I may so term it =  and
Enable them by - Sympathetic Laws - to produce in
you Hypochondriism & then they are entirely your
 Master [?] and if it is a Sacrifice - its of little consequence
 whether the quantity is large or small.

8276   The obstacles to spiritual knowledge [is]
seems to me insurmountable, even
when you seem to know all You find
by one little stroke your whole reasons
& arguments overthrown and when you 
are on the road to Spiritual Knowledge
there seems to be more impenetrable
darkness than when you set out

Altho' I once thought I knew something of Spiritual
matters. I now find my knowledge is as nothing
Shall I progress thro the kind assistance of my
GS the CA.

8277   I have no one to help me and I cant
fight against so much Evil
     I would willingly know enough
to do good but it seems I only know
[?]
original

sufficient to do a great deal of harm

The CA expressed so great a sympathy for you that 
I am sure he would readily assist you if you really 
wish to study Spiritualism only for knowledge and 
good purposes.

8278    Would he appear if I was to call him

I will ask him [and] and also for any advice you
wish to recive

8279  If you will be kind enough to overcome 
the difficulty that will be sufficient

to what do you allude or do you wish me to use those
words. ?

8280   The difficulties altogether attending 
progress in Spiritualism.

do you mean to enable you to receive in one [?] Good Spirits 
only. 

8281   Yes and to prevent Evil from appearing in
any - that is positively Evil -
  I have been studying now and continually
inspecting the crystal for ten years and 
although I have seen many interesting
visions and received enough to convince
me of the Knowledge of Spirits that have
appeared as connected with things and 
persons on earth, I have not received
any thing of real value, any thing
that I can preserve and read at another
time

You surprise me much. Since I have again renewed
cyrstal work. I have kept a diary of all my 
actions with the Spirits, and have received much
that to me is deeply interesting & instructive.

8282  Although I do not for a moment envy
You your knowledge Yet I wish I had 
the same

Will you then appear next Tuesday. & hear what the
CA advises

8283  I will thank you Good bye.

♂︎die 22 Jan 1856             C. A Mirror
                     Invoked the C.A.
7.30 PM.
Mr Anderson appeared in the Oval mirror last Tuesday 
Evening he wished me to ask your advice

2188  8284  do so

I then explained Mr A's wishes (see page    )

2189   8285  If he dedicated his mirror to his GS. he 
must keep it for a particular sort of spiritual 
information
     I do not think he would be able to do 
this for although he does not desire Evil 
he calls so many different visions of 
people and of places, and of things that 
he himself has not seen, and mixing 
them together without exercising any control 
over them he makes a fine opportunity for 
evil Spirits to appear.

Am I right in advising him to get a new mirror &ded'. 
it to his GS. and then call alone his GS. to appear 
or show the req'd visions

2190   8286   You are, if he would do this he would be 
right but visions and Communications only 
of Spiritual [interest] (sic) import would not 
interest him as they do you.
     His GS. is powerful to keep Evil 
away, if he entreats him to do so, I have 
no doubt he will be successful in obtaining 
the miscellaneous visions without evil 
appearing unless he in some measure 
desire it.

I intend going on Thursday Ev'g. to my friend Lea's 
shall I advise him to put by his mirrors &c for 
3 or 4 months & change his course of reading &c &c

2191  8287   Your advice would be good and well meant 
but to him it must seem strange that 
you should desire him to give up and put
[*17*]

out of the way, what you use and have 
sought for as much as he is doing, yourself

I explained my motives

[*2192 8288*] You are quite right if he will follow your 
advice he may free himself from the Evil 
that is hanging over him, [*see page 8*] the very 
atmosphere around him seems to be 
impregnated with Evil from the very worst

[*8239 & 41*] Sound,  I regret it exceedingly, I do not 
know the cause of it all, but I think it 
is more through errors made in mistake 
than wilfully, be that as it may, there is 
only one way by which he can purify 
himself, and arm himself against them 
by turning himself in prayer to the Source 
from which all good proceeds, and humbly 
in heart and Spirit entreat sufficient 
light for discerning the truths of religion 
sufficient strength to overcome the 
difficulties attending it and need clear 
perception of that which is made plain 
to him.

I ret'd thanks & req'd if the C.A. had any advice &c.

[*8289 2193*] I have not this Evening

I solicited a continuance of his work on Spiritual 
Philosophy

Now the books come & the CA's leaving -

[*8290*] 8 PM "The Leaves will turn over when you desire 
commenced in the order of natures Laws &c down to 
show that you are a reasonable and responsible being 
even in the face of destiny.

9.30 PM.

9.35. PM. Oval Mirror

Called Mr Anderson

Now he's come as before. & his he's [?] to your reply

I will now read the CA's advice

[*8291*] I thank you, do so

I read the CA's responses, & asked if I had made
18

8292  You have and I thank you for the
Information, I will get a new mirror and
dedicate it to my Guardian Spirit + before
Calling any vision I will ask him if it is
by his permission, will this be right =

I think so, I am myself limited to Tuesday,
Evenings unless I specially obtain an'r Seance 

8293  I am limited to one hour every Evening 
or an hour in the morning.

I explained my course of action.

8294   I will do so I will get one without loss of
time but before doing so I will  discharge
the others and put them away until I 
have his permission to use them again
if I cannot do right I will not willingly
do wrong
     I should like to hear something
that you have received if you are not otherwise
occupied

It is now so near 10. oclock & my young friend is
suffering from Toothache, or else I should have wished
to ask if you had seen any thing curious lately

8295   I have received strange things - there is
no occasion for me to detain You on
Tuesday Evenings, I suppose I can appear
on any other. I do not see why I cant

Will you appear on Friday Evening, that we may
have a longer chat.

8296   Yes

What do you think of the Proposals for Peace

8297   Think it is all humbug, but wish it was true

You once promised to favor me with your name, have
you still an objection to [?] it

8298  Yes I have.

Then I wont press it

8299  I must wish you good Evening

Heres our friend Selina wants to say a word to you

8300  Glad to see you Miss
19
did you get your promotion in the Army

8301  No
I believe I told you that I was thanked
for my services and told that promotion 
having been given me so young I should
not be able to have another so quickly after

You told me you had your fortune told has it come
true.

8302  Not a bit at least not yet, I have neither
lost a leg nor got into disgrace exactly
though vastly near the latter., I must 
go now - Good Evening =

hes gone 5 to 10 PM.

♂︎ die.  29 Jan 1856          C. A. Mirror
                       Invoked the C. A
I mentioned my having been on the Thursday to my friend
Mr Lea's & had read the whole of the later Spirit Comm'ns

2194   8303   He can free himself from the Spiritual
Influence as I have before told you

I will write to him with a copy of the response relat'd to him

2195  8304   do so

As our Tuesday Ev's are occupied entirely with your
Valued Comm'ts on Spiritual Philosophy may I devote
Friday Evenings to calling Mr Anderson.

2196  8305  There is no objection to M Anderson appearing
on Friday Evenings if you & himself wish it

If &c

2197  8306   Nothing shall appear without my sanction
unless you desire it - I have not the least
objection to any appearance that is not evil
or has no evil tendency
     You know Evil Spirits from Good and
you have no reason to call them.

If any advice &c

2198  8307  I have not, if you find my book weary
20

weary you or that which it contains 
means [?] with what seems to you truth 
If you tell it to do so, it will immediately leave 
I mention this not because you have hitherto 
shown the slightest disregard for it, but for 
fear that courtesy should make you listen 
to what from another you would pass over

I explained at length

2199  8308   I thank you

The leaves will turn over when you desire it

25' past 8 The book came & the CA left., the book slowly 
opened, the Translation came slowly my seer still 
suffering much from toothache. which impaired her 
vision

2200  8309   Commenced at  "If man has his own Spiritual 
life &c down to. great as it was powerful

5'  Past 10   Called Mr Anderson             Oval Mirror
he came immediately =
I was unfortunately unable to keep my appointment last 
Tuesday Evening  but I shall be happy to see you next 
Friday if agreeable to you.

[2201]  8310   I will appear on any Friday you may call 
me for sometime to come.
     I have got a new mirror, I went about 
it on Wednesday morning.

Do you intend to consecrate it to Constantine

[2202]   8311 Yes I do, and shall inspect it for the first 
time next Sunday, when next I appear 
I shall be able to tell you how I can get 
on.

Our Evenings on Tuesday are quite taken up receiving 
the CA's work on Spiritual Philosophy, the rendering 
it in English takes so long a time, my Seer also suff's 
much pain - Hurts her Sight

[2203]  8312   If it is metaphysical & obliged to be given 
by a Spirit to you - you must necessarily
21

be slow to comprehend the language that 
he gives his ideas in, it must be a great 
trouble for him to make himself understood 
by you

I explained the apparent process of the translation

[2204]  8313  Could you understand the work in its 
original form I have no doubt it would be 
far more beautiful than being interpreted

I must say I have great pleasure in receiving it

[2205]   8314  does it treat of religion then.

Yes it is, entirely confined to Met'l. & Spiritual Philosophy 
man's Spiritual being here, and his state hereafter

[2206]  8315   What does he say concerning a future state 
Are the prayers of the living of any use to 
those that are dead.

The prayers of a paid priest cannot be of any avail for the 
spiritual help of a deceased soul who in life he perhaps 
never knew., but as the Souls of deceased persons linger 
for some time after death in the Atmosphere. & still cling 
to earth. then the Earnest prayers of near or dear friends 
doubtless assist it, by urging it into the right path. - thro 
the Atmospheric Spirits being conjoined - have I made 
myself understood by you.

[2207]  8316  You have, it is an objection that I cannot 
surmount in the Roman Catholic Religion 
I can believe in their Miracles, and I can 
have faith in the Virgin Mary as a Mediator 
between Man and God - but I cannot 
see how the prayers of the priests, or the 
festivals, for they are such to help deceased 
Souls in purgatory can be of any use 
neither do I believe in the power of the 
Church to Excommunicate those living

If a priest prayed for deceased Souls. for Christ sake 
only. I could believe in their Efficacy - but when you 
must first 'tip' them the Almighty dollar - I think 
it's but a sorry Investment.

[2208]  8317  It is as you say, but granted that they
1/a/ Apostolic descent
     "Measured by the standard of some Prelates he (Dr Stanley) was 
     certainly deficient in Lordly Arrogance; in love of Ease, and rank 
     and money; and in pretensions to Apostolic Succession & priestly 
     domination; he rested his claims to respect and confidence on the Man, 
     rather than on the lawn of the mitre
                               [?] Alexanders Memoir of Ed Stanley DD late Bishop 
                                               of Norwich.

Bishop Stanley says "my greatest Trials arise from those of the Clergy 
     who are loudest in their Cry of 'the Church in danger" but who 
     never do any thing to keep it from danger.' - p. 33. Ibid

In 1844 Dr Stanley. was called upon in London to preach the Annual 
     Sermon before the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign 
     Parts, when he took the opportunity, in stating that he deemed the 
     True Claims of the Church of England, to disavow the doctrine of 
     Apostolic succession.  The bishops and the [metropolitan?] Clergy 
     were assembled as usual on that occasion, and before them all 
     he declared that the extravagancies of Tractarianism were traceable 
     to the dogma of Apostolic Succession - a dogma "insupportable by 
     Scripture and History, and leading to no good results in practice" 
     he spoke boldly of the great uncertainty which hangs over the very 
     beginning of this supposed claim of Apostolic descent, declared 
     that it had no authority in the New Testament, and bade his 
     dignified auditory remember that no one has been able yet to 
     disentangle the Confusion in which the Successive links of the 
     so called succession are involved - exhorted his brethren 
     not to press a Claim so liable to excite the contempt of the 
     discriminating portion of the Community - and significantly remind'g
     them of the purpose to which it may be turned "by men 
     covetous of power, given to intrigue, influenced by ambition 
     & worldly self interested principles."

In his diary at the End of 1842. Dr Stanley writes. "God grant that my life may be 
     prolonged until I have effected the great object I had in view, in undertaking 
     the labors imposed upon me, may I live to see the Triumphs of Christian 
     principles in the Church. uncontaminated and undefiled by the [?] 
     sordid and worldly passions connected with what has hitherto been 
     called - so falsely and so fatally for its real interests - Attachment 
     to the Church."
they did it for love and not for money what 22
power could they have to rid those gone
without their knowledge sinful from the
world.
I like the Roman Catholic Religion separate
from its priesthood
The Roman Catholic Religion is doubtless the  best in the
world to live and die by- if- you could only believe it-
but self appointed "mediatorial priests" have ever been
the Sermon friends of the Nespohsion - they are
soul-crushers themselves and ever ready to [?] the
body-crushers-

8318    But you be here in the doctrine of the Church
/a/   of England no preached by them
So for only as consistent with the kinds of [views?], &tc.
I deny their Apostalical Descent & mediational claims

8319    You be here in Jesus Christ as being the only
mediator and the Communion offered by
the Church as his real flesh and blood.
I believe in the DemiGodhead of the Trinity and that
Jesus is the mediator-but not in the real presence
in the eucharist.

8320   I think that the sacrament should not be
received except by those who devote their
lives to his purpose - but still it seems
to me that of the Son is powerful and one
with, the Almighty, the Mother cannot
be forgotten. - She must be as great as
he-She must have her place near the
throne of grace and be able to intercede
for those that acknowlege her.
I believe in the Virgin Mary being an intercessor for
those who pray to her- as the mother of our Lord.
but  altho the chosen vessel Herself above all women.
I cannot consider her created equal to the Creator. & indeed
Jesus' own words "women  what have I to do with
these." [is apt if.]

8321    You do not then, like the Protestant Clergy
23

believe that to have faith in her and to
pray to her to intercede for us in sin. or to
protect us when we need it, that that
faith shall [damn?] us everlastingly

No I do not  nor do I think the Ch. of highland Clergy
view it in that light

8322   but they denounce it in the pulpit  I
cannot believe otherwise

My objection is, that no where in the Gospel,  in the words
of Jesus or in those of his apostles is the Virgin Mary
[directed] held up as an intercessor,  indeed the few
places in which she is mentioned, is directly opposed
to such a view.

8323  I think if you have a religion of your own
- if you form opinions and sincerely believe
those opinions to be true and act up to
them.  and have faith in them, that
through that faith in the religion you
follow. you would be favored
     Surely it would be better than
harrassing your mind with so many
conflicting opinions  and at last half
believing in the religions that you called
yours.
     I believe in some of the doctrines
of the Church of England and some of time
but I am a member of neither for according
to both  I find I am beyond their
redemption --
     It is late now.  I am afraid I detain
you. --
     Good Evening

Good night
20' to 11 PM.
on turning to the 5th Page of my MS - I found I had
made the error mentioned - which I corrected.

♂︎ 3 Feb 1856     CA Mirror
            Invoked the C A
Last Tuesday Evening, The transl'n of the Spiritual Philosophy
came extremely slow.  probably in consequence of my seer
suffering so sadly from Toothache -- I mention it now because
I covet obtaining  each evening as large a portion as possible
in the time devoted to it

2201   8524   I desire to make it as plain as possible
I will do all that I can to make it come faster
And plainer, before you begin this evening
Will you alter one word in the 15th line of the
5th page of your copy the mistake is but
slight but it alters the sense of the foregoing
Message.
     Will you kindly put collected instead of
Created--

Accept my Thanks I have now altered it, may I for
the encrease of my knowledge in Crystal work, ask
how you became aware that the error was in the 15th
line of the 5th page of my [?] MS.

2202  8325   Where my composition is, that is my
Knowledge and Ideas and feelings, these
am I attached in some degree, I never
lose sight of what passes from me.
that book has the same influence as my
Seal.

May I &c

2203   8326   I have not.
If you should desire it I will appear to you
when you are ended.

1/4 to 8   Now the books come & the CA's left.

2204  8327  [of all the attributes, down to   to them it
must be known.]

The C A appeared
If any &c

2205  8328  I have not this evening

25'. to 10 PM  Action ended

♀ die  8  Feb'y 1856.          Oval Mirror 
                   Called Mr. Anderson
Mr. Anderson is here in black but indistinctly
Good Ev'g.  Can you tell me why we see you so indistinctly

8329   I appear as plain as I can.
Very likely you will see me plainer presently

Will you oblige me by telling the time by my watch
if I place it ag't the mirror

8330   I cannot even see you

Mr. Anderson appeared a long way off & very pale & wan
I am afraid by your looks you have not recovered the
Effects of the Crimea

8331   O Yes I am all right  thank you

Do you remember my telling you that we formerly
often saw and conversed with you as of 1864  & also
your little Son.

8332   Yes and I have seen it myself, but I think it
is very improbable.

Have you any idea who the Mr Hamilton is  you &
My Seer have seen in my Crystal, & whom we saw in
his Trial for Murder.

8333   I know two or 3 Hamiltons but not intimately
I know but one that could be any where
near the age of the one I have seen

The circumstances connected with that transaction were
so minute yet strange, & has interested me so much
that I have often wished to ask if you could give me
any clue to it

8334  It seemed to me as [to be] more likely to be
taking place abroad than in England
such things so seldom happen here
and the language you know might have
been made English by the spirit of the  [*✔︎*]
Crystal, from several things I have seen
I conclude it must have related to a trans'n
that will take place probably in the South
of France about 1862.
     There will be a Revolution there then
26

then if I have seen truly
during the last 2 years, the visions shown in my Mirror
have entirely changed their Character, tho not so
curious they are of a higher Class, and I think it is
only Spirits of a lower Sphere that can show, events
about to happen to Mortals, shortly before they take place

8335
It may be so but still there seems one
method at least I have found it so, throughout
the whole of the Communications with Spirits
I think when they first show you a vision
they have some end in View and you are
led from one to another, for beginning at
light Knowledge and that which seems
trifling, but which must of course be as
important in itself as the highest spiritual
vision for the same law must govern both
So beginning with lighter matter
you are led step after step to seek
better Knowledge and to aim at a 
nobler purpose than that of amusement
or light instruction and through all this
course of visions it seems to me that
those who show them, only show those
that work out a particular doctrine
of their own, and if they have a power
of showing that which they please they
can also withhold those that would
interfere with their course of action

This is probably the case as to Points of doctrine but
the visions I allude to are those which show the
Trifling every day events of Common life, before they take
place. such as occurred on my Crystal some
years ago when Mrs. Woodward inspected for me
& altho utterly a stranger to me, told me Events
all of which have been verified to the letter -

8336
I can see things that are about to take
place, and I see many that do not
take place & this I cannot account for
27
Sometimes things that I don't want
to know any thing about, which [ ]
rather not not see come whenever I look into the
crystal and there [ ] I am obliged
to put it away

In other times when I [ ]tenly
desire to see what I ask for I have no vision
at all that others I am [ ] a vision
and I believe it is the one I have no [ ]
no circumstances from whom, and I [ ]
when the time arrives [ ] to take place
that it is perfectly wrong but still
there are a great number of things [ ] known
to me that I can see and [ ] and them [ ] nice
perfectly correct.

[ ] never hear any events [ ]
And it is best that you do not if you can
see my thoughts but I have seen so long
and I put such part [ ] spirit[ ]
that even when I see [ ] I am off [ ]
and length of time [ ] looking again
Now I have taken hold of my [ ] hand can you
see me.

8337 
Very indistinctly
Can you see my special[  ]

8339
Yes
You need family to see everything about me trying
me and my dress.  I tell no [  ] the [ ]
Can you describe what is on the table now

8340
I can see the room, the air seems so
oppresive I should say these who [ ]
in the room and I have which it is the
case with atmospheric spirits and also
with perfect spirits a great objection to [ ].

There is about 4 feet from this mirror a large
globe of [ ] with goldfish thing - I am [  ]
that it can affect you


28

8341  I feel it tho not so much as to make
it unpleasant or prevent my appearing plain
but I think there are two kinds of Spirits
you might call that it would either attract
towards it or immediately dispel, the living
bodies in the water, make it of course  more
like a Sea or river -

I have & am now receiving from my Guardian Spirit
a work entitled Metaphysical & Spiritual Philosophy
in which he gives his views of Spiritual Laws shall
I read you a portion - 

8342   I should be very much pleased 

I read 2 or 3 pages & asked if I made myself understood

8343   You have thank you will you read more

I read the first seven pages., and asked
do you receive such Spiritual information

8344  I do not at such length.
it is certainly a lucid, logical & very wild
Theory.  It makes me desire to hear more
it seems so new.

I have received about 30 page I hope to read you at
an'r time a further extract.

8345  Thank You
I never heard before of a spirit who did 
not believe in Eternal punishments, it is
a subject you can rarely get them to
speak upon, I have asked the question 
many times and they replied evasively
or not at all.

The CA's views are that punishment to the Wicked
is lasting - not everlasting - not eternal.

8346   It is very shocking to think that even
the worst of men should suffer eternally
and there is a conviction in ones own 
heart, that it is not so, for when we feel
particularly conscientious, when even the
regard the sufferings of men around us when
even we [regain the s] alleviate the pain
29

of a man of earth we feel I think [ ]
for it, we feel as it were a ray of light from
an applauding source, as though we were
rewarded from an simple [  ] of good
and of I've have this feeling when the object
is so [ ], how much [ ] so [ ] the
feelings of perfect goodness be when [ ]
on my object important as its now
creation.

I was much [ ] the other [ ] that it's
going his [ ] of the doctrine [ ]
by Plato & Aristotle it appeared to the so [ ]

8347 
Why singular if the [ ] a spirit
that has here been embodied he was in
all probability the same 2000 years ago
as now, the [ ] intelligince, and proof
of the spriits being is memory, and if he
has taken a delight in metaphysical
and then for [ ] with [ ], it does
not seem strange that he should [ ]

greatest in the science, indeed Greece has
produced in all ages the greatest [ ]

I think it is nine clippings, if that

[ ] of you wish read his remarks on plato this 
[ ] Aristotle.

8348
Do so I should be much [   ]
you be kind enough to read the passage
which relates to aristotle & plato.

I read them.

8349
It is very simply but very unmarketly
written.
It is very strange - Then if the spirit
cannot be enlarged as dimished but
exists for his for the [ ] from [ ]
sort must out the last day, enter the
presence of god, in the form that is shown.
30

Now on Earth, have you asked whether
he means that up to that time it retains
the form or whether it retains it before + after
that time in all Eternity.

Your question would have been needless but at your
request I have read to you the latter part of the C A's
Comm n. leaving out the middle, in which the C A shows
that Man eventually loses the human form. - I have
skipped 20 pages which I will do my self the pleasure
of reading to you at another opportunity

8350 I shall be much gratified how long do
you think the book will last unfinished

My Seer tells me the book appears to get longer + if it
lasts 12 months I shall be more gratified 

8351 As he does not seem to enter into [*the*] detail
of what he advances I should imagine the
subject would soon be exhausted 
for in many works on mental philosophy
you find the same arguments used over
and over again only in different words
and in the fine language used you almost
lose the thread of the doctrine. 

That is certainly the case with all the Metaphysical
works which I have read but the C A's commun n.
comes down to the meanest capacity [*1100*]

8352 It does and is really much more to the 
Purpose.

May I ask if you will gratify me with a relation
of any thing curious in the Spiritual way that has
occured to you since your long absence 

8353 I told you the last time that when next
I came I would tell you how I got on
when inspecting my new mirror. I 
believe I did not tell you then what day 
I was going to look.
I had not inspected my small
Crystal for some time previous to purchasing
[*31*]

[?] the new mirror but in the evening I had 
it already & wished to commence, I fetched my 
crystal and called Constantine, I was not 
perfectly certain if he remained my Guardian 
Spirit - instead of his appearing there came 
something like a Globe stand and the place 
occupied by the world as is usual was here filled 
with what appeared to be a vessell of water 
perfectly round and with a Spirit in it, but 
of course from the size of the Crystal this Spirit 
was scarcely visible, and to all my questions 
I could get no answer, and I could not 
understand whether it was desired that I 
should use a vessel of water or whether my 
GS was changed from Constantine to a Spirit 
of Water -

You will say I am always in difficulties 
I waited for about half an hour and then I 
dismissed it and again called Constantine 
but had a Vision - well then I thought 
I could do no harm if I ded'd. my mirror 
to my GS. without naming him and I 
did it fervently, however humbly, after 
doing this I removed the Veil from the 
mirror and inspected it, after looking abt. 
10 minutes there appeared to be curtains 
of thin gauze like silk, falling in folds 
from the top, sometime longer and these 
folds straightened & the mirror appeared to 
be covered on the Silver Side, with a plain 
transparent tissue, behind this there app'd. 
the shadow of a figure and the words came 
before the Veil

"The Spirit now in the Mirror will 
answer your questions."

I could not then understand the nature 
of the Vision and I was somewhat doubtful 
of its goodness, for I have been so many
[*32*]

times deceived by the first appearance of 
beauty, that I could not rely on it without 
seeing further so I answered, by desiring 
Constantine to appear plain if he was 
my Guardian Spirit - The answer merely 
came

"Constantine is not your Guardian Spirit"

Well then I asked how long since he had 
ceased to be and it said

Only at the moment you dedicated 
your mirror to your GS.

Well then of course I asked who was my GS. 
and the answer singular enough was.

If we would be known why blind 
thy Eyes

What am I to think?

Why did you not exorcise strongly.

[*8254*] I immediately exorcised it on hearing this 
answer and the form remained through 
the veil but of course I could not tell whether 
it had changed for if one form had 
immediately taken the place of the other 
it would appear the same thro' the veil

I explained my views

[*8255*] When it would not answer more directly 
my question, I dismissed it saying that 
if it would appear without the veil. I sh'd 
be pleased to see it again and then again 
I called Constantine. but it did not even 
get clouded, for half an hour I called 
and looked, and having no success at 
all I went back to my old friend the 
little Crystal and there I saw the same 
globe

I must tell you that before beginning 
with the mirror I dismissed all visions 
from the Crystal and it remained dismissed 
while I was looking but now on taking

Capt. Anderson's relation of "The Bottle Imp"
 see page 8
33
it up it seemed to be there before
I looked till my Eyes ached I could get no 
reading  and all I could distinguish of
the spirit on the globe. was that it was
black and had what appeared to be a large
white clothe rolled round its head.

I hope you did not use this bottle of water

8356
No I did not, nor I dont mean to do it
again did I ever tell You how a spirit
escaped from a bottle of water I was
using once.

No do tell us that

8357
I had been looking in the Crystal one
Friday evening for a long time without
Seeing any vision before I left off I
asked of the Spirit of the Crystal very strongly
when I could have a vision for it is so
very wearying to look and anticipate and
then be disappointed - there immediately came
Procure a vessel a foot deep flat-
sided and six inches square, fill it with 
water from a fish pond have the neck
of the vessel sufficiently large to admit
your three fingers - cut the middle
finger of your left hand having put
a strip of paper round the outside of
the middle of the bottle write with the
blood of the finger you have cut the
one name.
Paste this strip of Paper Round the
bottle and then insert the finger you
have pricked with the two others into
the neck, and from it into the water
let a drop of blood flow. - and it said
if you do this, You will see and hear
of that which will instruct you in
spiritual knowledge and aid you
[*34*]

[*8357*] you in all that you desire appertaining 
to the world.

Although I thought it could not be 
Good, I did not desire any thing Evil and 
I thought foolishly that I could have and 
see and know what they said without allow'g 
them to influence me, or without for one moment 
surrendering myself to their possession

I would not do it again, it was not the 
power but the knowledge that I sought - 
I was at the time in a house with a good 
many people in it, and fearing that some 
one might interrupt me I locked the door 
before I began the preparation, I was obliged 
to have a glass bottle made the exact size 
I got the bottle and wrote the name on 
a vellum band and sealed it on

This I placed on the Table and 
very soon without any call I used nothing 
more than the name on the bottle. the 
water began to change to a thick dirty red 
liquid and from this there formed as the 
water again became clearer a spirit more 
like an animal than even a distorted human 
[being] figure with a tail as long in proportion 
to its size as that of a mouse and peculiar 
shaped horns - it increased in size so as 
to fill the entire bottle the top of the horns 
coming above the water in the neck of the 
bottle and the horns to the top of the 
Neck., When I saw its head coming 
above the water I thought I should be 
able to prevent it getting [away] any larger 
by putting a stopper on the top, I could 
not find any thing to cover over it at the 
moment but a book that was on the 
mantle piece in the instant that I stept 
across for the book the horns of the
[*35*]

[*8357*] Spirit were visible to me above the bottle 
very quickly you may imagine I got back 
with the book - I am very strong - as strong 
as I believe most men, I can lift a couple 
of hundred weight, and now I had occasion 
to put my strength forth. I tried to press 
the book on the neck of the bottle. with all 
my might but I could not move it one inch 
My hands and the book in them went up 
as easy as I could have lifted a baby's now I got 
desperate I tore the band off round the 
bottle, I used exorcism, there was no fire 
in the room & no light or I would have 
immediately burned the band, I could not 
tear it and I had no means of destroying 
it - the Spirit all this time was 
gradually getting out of the bottle -

I could not tell what to do I took 
the bottle up threw it down and broke it 
the water of course ran all over the carpet 
and I thought for a moment that I had 
got rid of the Spirit but I was mistaken 
for from the water as it lay on the floor he 
rose again much larger than before,

I went to the door but I was afraid 
then to open it - Then in an instant I 
thought he might be only visible to me 
and not to others and if I got with other 
people he would disappear from me and 
then I tried the door but I could not 
unfasten it, I forgot that I had locked 
it, again I used the power of [?] 
for Crystal Spirits, and exorcism, but it 
was of no use, having done this I ventured 
to ask him, what he wanted - He 
asked me to Test his power by naming 
any thing that I desired and if. I 
found that he gave it me and would
[*36*]

[*8357*] Promise him obedience he would do the 
same in all other things -

I resolutely told him that I would 
not that had I knew that he was Evil 
and could escape from the bottle I would 
not have called him - still he did not 
leave and I then felt the place insufferable 
so oppressive as to be almost suffocating 
- my eyes seemed to burn, I seemed to be 
getting giddy and to see instead of the 
one figure a thousand of all shapes and 
sizes - I still remained standing with 
my hand on the lock and the room seemed 
[?] to grow confined and dark, only for 
one instant, then all was light again & 
the Evil Spirit was gone, and I noticed 
that every drop of water was gone from 
the surface of the carpet, and that there 
was on the white ground that surrounded 
the pattern a single red spot, although 
I felt frightened when the Spirit was 
present - I was not the least when it was 
gone and felt recovered & so thankful 
that I had got rid of it., and determined 
to be more careful in future. and was 
beginning to think how I could account 
for the mess I had made & was beginning 
to pick up the pieces of bottle to walk 
off with when stooping to pick up some 
of the small pieces that were on this red 
spot, I saw that round it there was a 
circle and in the circle words., Even then 
by an impulse I could not control I 
was all on fire to know what those words 
were, before I stopped to decypher them 
I took up the band that had been round 
the bottle and the pieces of the bottle 
themselves and threw the bottle away and
This was the same Spirit who appeared in my Oval Mirror 
and offered me the Diamonds    page 7.
[*37*]

[*8357*]

burnt in another room the band that 
was round it, back I went and down on my 
knees to try and decypher this reading I 
mastered it on the band round the red spot were

(a) "---- returns blood that is too white 
for a sacrifice"

and the little red spot that had before 
seemed on the Carpet, rose above it, the words 
disappeared and there only remained a 
little piece of cold congealed blood, this I 
removed very much gratified all traces 
of the water were gone and that was the last 
interview I have had with Spirits out of 
the Crystal.

I then showed Mr Anderson the picture of the spirit 
at page [*3000*] who offered me the diamond and asked 
if ----- resembled it.

[*8358*] Very nearly.

I am afraid I have taken you very long

I am obliged by your curious & instructive comm'n. 
I will enquire of the C.A. your best mode of 
proceeding with your GS.

[*8359*] I wish I could ascertain his name

I will not detain you longer

Good Evening

I will enquire on Tuesday & if possible let you know 
on Tuesday next. - if that will be time enough

[*8360*] I shall not use it before then

Good Evening

Good night.

1/4 to 11 PM.

[*This [appointment?] appears to 
have gone [?] until 
my [?]*]
[*38*]

[?] Feb. 12. 1856 C.A. Mirror

Invoked the C.A.

Before receiving the Continuation of the Spiritual Philosophy 
I wish to ask some advice relative to my friend Mr Lea

[*2206 8361*] Do so but I will first mention that his wife 
is very desirous of appearing in your mirror 
this Evening.

Mr Lea has informed me by Letter that upon invoking Lero 
his GS. to appearance. Lero app'd & said that you were desirous 
of appearing - & that you then appeared in his mirror and 
advised him to bring his mirror to Croydon, for my Seer 
to inspect next Tuesday -

[*2207 8362*] I am quite willing to appear in his mirror 
if he brings it here, next Tuesday.

May I ask if you so directed him to come

[*2208 8363*] Yes

I shall then of course be happy to meet your wishes - as 
under your Guidance I feel sure no harm will arise

[*2209 8364*] There are still Evil Spirits attending him 
but if he desired it, and acts as I have before 
mentioned he may rid himself of them 
I have sufficient power to keep them 
either from his mirror, from himself and 
from you and yours while he is present 
with you, otherwise I would not upon 
any account have advised him to come

As to Mr P's letter concerning [S.J.?]

[*2210 8365*] As an act of Charity there can be no object'n 
to it - but you must not do it often 
for your own good I cannot bear to see 
you give to others, what would do yourself 
good.

Mr Anderson appeared last Tuesday Evg and we had 
a long Interview I read him a portion of your 
work on Spiritual Philosophy and in [relation] return 
he related a singular Circumstance which occurred 
between him & -----, who emerged from a bottle 
of Water -
[*39*]

[*2211 8366*] ----- Is the same spirit that app'd 
to you, it is the same that follows Mr L. and 
it is one of the oldest Evil Spirits existing and 
although not so powerful as some it is ever 
ready to profit by the weakness or the 
sins of those to whom it attaches itself 
through an advantage offered by them

Mr Anderson has processed a new mirror & dedicated it to 
his GS. & then invoked his G.S. & a spirit appeared behind 
the vail - & as he was not aware positively who was his 
his G.S. & could not prevail upon the Spirit to appear 
plainly - he dismissed it & I said I would ask your advice

[*2212 8367*] Constantine is still his GS. 
It was a good vision that appeared the 
first time he used the mirror, and if he was 
not so excessively irritable and impatient 
he would not have so much difficulty 
Will you tell him to wait longer after he 
has exorcised it next time before he dismisses 
it - And that as he cannot govern the 
Spirit that appears & make it appear 
plainer he must wait patiently until it 
develops itself.

If any &c

[*2213 8368*] I have not this Evening I think it would be 
better to look in your box mirror before 
you close your Evening Communication

Do you mean my oval mirror in the case or my 
[?] Glass.

[*8369 2214*] The one you have in your hand

Will you now favor us with the book

[*8370*] I will

Now the books come & the CAs gone

[*8371 2215*] (From its Earthly Shape &c down to 
which as the mind in the body it yielded 
to & loved)

10 PM.

Oval Mirror
10 PM Called Mrs Lea.
Now its thick now theres some one coming - its a round
crystal its getting longer - it is the Green Crystal &
theres some one in it - Its a large face the size of
the Crystal - now the Crystal is getting much larger
It is Mr Leas face in it quite plain the looks at 
You [?] theres reading Come

8372 Leas coming to your house next Tuesday
isnt he - have you any objection to my
coming with him I should like to come
very much.

There are reasons why I wd rather he came alone

8373 Why 

I explained -

8374 It would not make any difference about
that I could come down + see Mrs. Leigh
 and Selina besides I want to look in
your mirror
I dont like it it could not make any
difference if I came - I would come down
myself first if that was all and Lea
could come with you

As you are only my friends at Spirit its no use asking
the spirit - I shall I hope see you on Thursday
in proper person - & then your other self will I have
no doubt be satisfied with the [?].

8375 You come to my house fast enough, but
you are pretty shy about asking me
back again, and I can tell you that
in the body as well as here, I desire to
come and if you don't write me - I
dont think we shall be such good friends
as we have been

Are you friend Lea inspecting your crystal

8376 No I aint, do you mean to invite me
No I dont. + I am sure your sensible - other self will
be satisfied with the reasons
[*41*]

now Mrs. L's gone stormed round & looked so cross 
at you. - 

1/4 past 10 PM. Called Mr Anderson.

immediately -

[*8377*] Good Evening

I will not detain you long as my Seer is in much pain 
with her tooth - but I wished to tell you the CA's opinion

[*8378*] Thank you I am in no hurry.

Can you tell me what will ease her.

[*8379*] Have you tried mesmerism

No there are many urgent reasons why I should not 
besides I never intend to mesmerise a Lady again - I 
thought of trying one of the Electric bands lately invented

[*8380*] I know that Galvanism was good, I did 
not know there was a new way of applying 
it - 3 of my back teeth are gone

& you are only 25

[*8381*] Oh its not the age thats done it

I then read the CAs communication (p. 39) & asked if 
I had made myself understood

[*8352*] You have

I do control myself as much as I can 
but it is impossible for me who have such 
a love of Spiritual Communion & Knowledge 
to be ever calm and patient when I have 
such difficulty in obtaining a vision I require 
and if I do obtain after a long & tedious 
asking the vision that I have called 
to find myself disappointed in my 
expectations or worse, baffled and tormented 
by Evil Spirits - its easy enough to preach 
patience but would only one however 
good placed in my situation be 
without the same failing

Here is your friend [?] solemn wishes to look & 
try if she can see you.

[*8383*] She should look in the Crystal probably
Mrs Lea & her husband had been [?] by [?] a 12 for he & as 
they were [?] and as long my [?] on [?] [?] they 
Spirit were then the rest [?] was with them 
bought one

See 8397
[*42*]

she would see me there - 
You had a vision before I came I understand

Yes [?] Lady friend came or rather went away in a [?]

[*8384*] What the Lady that has the smell of cakes 
raffled for - I always laugh when I 
think about that and I am not likely 
to forget it -

Earl Stanhopes Crystal

Selma took the ES. which I changed for Mr Anderson 
it became very clouded & she saw a dark line appear 
but it remained indistinct -

Oval Mirror

Called Mr Anderson

Selma has tried but she cannot see you altho' the 
Crystal clouded immediately - & you appeared but 
indistinctly

[*8385*] I can[not] well understand how some 
people cant see when others do - but I 
cannot make out how it is that some 
see faintly - if the Spirit was there at all 
one would imagine they could see it 
plain

Emma had now got some glasses that saves her eyes 
completely

[*8386*] That is an excellent thing for those who 
strain their eyes to look - it never affects 
my eyes in the least.

It was the CA who told me to get smoked glasses 
for the purpose - It is surprizing to me how the 
C.A. could know such things were to be had. I was 
quite ignorant of it myself

[*8387*] Not at all surprizing

Why not.

[*8388*] Because if you even as a mortal was 
spoken to on any thing that interested 
you, would would do all you could
[*43*]

to gain information about it and 
would search after any thing connected 
with the subject and it is not suprizing 
that a spirit who must have the power 
if he so will of passing through space 
and alighting at any place he desires 
is it surprizing he should obtain inform'n 
upon a subject you desired to know about 
and I suppose you first mentioned your 
difficulty

I am not surprized at any thing 
connected with Spiritualism I have 
known so many things that seems as 
incredible as they are unaccountable

I have very often asked the CA for a remedy for my 
seer without success.

[*8389*] Will he answer the same questions as regards 
another

No he generally recommends me to advise them to apply 
to the mesmeric Infirmary

[*8390*] It is strange, a simple remedy might 
have the power of a perfect one, and surely 
he would have the power of giving you one

The C.A. refuses to give me the power of healing because 
it would injure my own health.

[*8391*] I thought I understood you, that 
you believed the Spiritual Mediums in 
America acted under Evil influence when 
they performed their cures

Yes. but I thought cures might be performed by Prayer

[*8392*] Certainly but its no use arguing about 
what I at least do not understand but 
I shall detain you, its getting late

Have you seen to it lately

[*8283*] No I have not

I wish you would send him into the mirror

[*8294*] Who am I to ask for

Why the Gentleman we have so often seen you with
[*44*]

that has lost one finger of his left hand - we call him [WH?]

[*8395*] What a very profitable speculation I'll call him

We shall be obliged

[*8396*] then I will have good Evening

Will you come another Friday Eve'g if I call

[*8397*] I am writing to appear

If that Lady should appear again who 
I believe is slightly inclined to enter [?] 
you can tell her I am sorry I was not in 
London last 12th day or I should certainly 
have had a shillings worth. [*see 8384*]

Called WH

11 PM

Here's some one coming, its WH. he's got his hands in his 
pockets - Black frock coat grey trousers shaped down the 
side, his boot soles about an inch think & his trousers very 
short

Good Ev'g. I hope you are well

hes taken one hand out of his pocket and said

[*8398*] hi 

hows Mrs. Beechey

[*8399*] I have left them Lodgings

Selma wishes to know if you live in the country

[*8400*] No I dont

She wants to know why you wear such ugly boots then

[*8401*] I wear them in London I think I need them 
this dirty weather, I am sure they look very 
well

Are you in the Law still or have you turned Capt'n in the Militia

[*8402*] I am not in the Law now, had a little money 
left me.

independent I suppose

[*8403*] No I am't

You will want it then Selma says to furnish a house

[*8404*] Shant have a house mean to Lodge in a 
two [?]

But that wont do for a young Lady used to the country
45

8405  Then I shant marry a lackadaisical 
marm.

I am afraid your mother didnt spend much on your manners

8406  no  she didnt, and a very good job too   it w'd
have been all thrown away

Cant you give us "down among the dead men"  to night

8407  No -- left off singing whenever I sing out
I get drunk afterwards.

You never came to Croydon as you promised

8408  I came one Sunday

Come next and we will have some Grog together

8409  Cant next Sunday,  why dont you ask that
chap down -- who went to live at Carlton
Terrace -- very likely footman there --

do you mean our friend Mr Anderson

8410  Yes

Have you seen him lately

8411  No but I've heard about him, he's as big
a scamp as ever lived

hasn't he been in the Crimea

8412  went out there and got sent home
A person that I heard from about him
told me he was at Bristol

Can you tell me his name

8413  I never could pronounce it

well  spell it

8414  Its Spanish
I must go good night

Will you come again when I called you
he nodded his head towards Selina & left.

[?] Feb. 1856.  C A Mirror
7 30 PM Smoked the C A
My friend Mr Lea is now here agreeable to your appoint
I have called you in this mirror. first - shall I call
Lero into his Mirror before you appear in it [?] 
you appear in at once.

2216 8415 If you will dismiss Mr Lea's mirror I will
immediately appear in it

Zeros Mirror
tried the Dismissal
Now the CA's here, and the readings commenced

8416 "Mr Lea.
I was desirous of seeing you this
"Evening that I might solemnly propose to you
"the question " Cannot you believe in the Divinity
"of Christ?

2217 8417 If I address you thus individually
instead of generally it is not to
upbraid you for want of faith or to denounce
you, for your own belief. 
But I cannot let one opportunity
pass however slight a chance there may
appear, of teaching you in all humility
the means of approaching the Throne
of Grace through Love and not through
fear - not through fear as taught
by the Church, not by making God
appear to you worse than human,
not by holding him out to you as the
Church does as punishing with savageness
by the most frightful torments that
imagination can form ideas of -. His
Creation that he has imbues with
His own intelligence and his will
not by punishing them forever + ever
with those intolerable torments whilst
[*47*]

[*2217 8417*] he knew and allowed them to do the 
sins for which he [for which he] punished them 
now would I have you believe through fear of 
punishment in God - a Being perfect in his 
intelligence goodness mercy loving-kindness 
and justice and powerful as he is good. 
must shrink from the worship of one who 
approached him in dread - And if God 
himself, if the perfection of all goodness [evidence?] 
exists in the 5th Chapter of [?] John in the words 
of the Son that he and his father are one, and 
after telling the Jews this Father has 
shown him his actions and taught him 
in His ways that he is the same in every 
thing as the father He says in the 22nd verse 
in words that can neither be misunderstood 
or misused - For the Father judges no 
man, he leaveth all judgment unto the 
Son. and at the 27th verse he explains 
himself further, and the reason why the 
Judgment of men is given unto him for 
he says, The judgment is given [unto him] 
by the Father unto the Son, because he 
is the Son of Man - how much do these 
words mean - they undeniably show the 
careful love and mercy. of the Creator 
towards the Creation, for to lead men from 
the darkness and [?] that was on earth 
at that time it was necessary that a light. 
should be given them, a special providence 
should be shown them to direct them to 
the truth, but not this alone - The 
Father in his superiority and pure spirit 
could not be sufficiently near to the ills
and the evils of the world and the flesh 
to know all the errors and wants of men
and besides this, it was needful that an 
example should be shown by one of -
[*48*]

[*2217 8417*] themselves and to [show] [?] that he was 
not preaching humility [and] [?] living in affluence 
it was necessary that he who taught them 
should rise from the lowest station, he 
poor and needy, and have sorrows to strengthen 
those in affliction and to show them that 
piety and truth were not incompatible with 
poverty and wretchedness. who could do these 
offices who could make the word of God 
intelligible from the Spirit to material 
unless it was that Spirit incased in the 
material and made flesh, and the Son 
came, the Spirit of the Father descended 
from its place of holy happiness & went
through bitter trials, Trials that the
flesh shrunk from and the Spirit conquered
and when the Holy Mission was fulfilled
and the body was no longer needed, he
died an ignominious death and was an
example even then, for he showed them
at the last when the bitter cup was full
that he could pray for his destroyers &
when dieing he turns his eyes with mercy
for those suffering with him upon the
cross, Although they were sinful & degraded
that they should be with him in Heaven
There must exist sufficient evidence to show that
he is Divine    And thus through being
the Son of Man and knowing them well
from his intimate companionship, when
he returns to the Father that he had left
through his merit, and his sacrifice he
receives the reward of bestowing judgement
on them he has left on Earth.       And
if he be the Judge who was so faithful
upon Earth  who cured even the ills
of the flesh and was careful of the
comfort and happiness of all that
[*49*]

2217 
8417 
surrounded him, he who could come
from Heaven to [lead] be a [martyr] weary
pilgrim upon earth through life, and a
Martyr in death, surely on the Sins of
them he so loved he would be a mild
judge, but it is necessary that he should be
a just one, it would not be just to those who
believed in him and were his faithful
followers, to give them the same reward +
the same happiness at the same time with
those who [bl] blasphemed him and have
knowingly cast him off, and therefore
those who have known him through the
records given of his life, those who with intelligence
have reasoned and argued upon that
life, if they do not believe in him and
his union with the father unless they
can follow in faith that which seems to
them on the deepest consideration where
sound and truthful doctrine, those who 
after having appealed in prayer for
enlightenment from God and received 
from the Holy Spirit within them the 
conviction of a differing religion those are 
guilty of the greatest Sin
In acknowledging the existence
of the Savior of the world it is impossible
that you can feel you are wrong, He
does not wish to be worshipped openly
with form or ceremony but to be recognized
in the deep recesses of the heart, to receive
a faith greater and better than [the] 
knowledge, to be turned to when the Spirit
sinks under difficulties and the mind
fears for the soul, turn to him and he
will in no way cast you off.
however erroneous my have
been the past or however fraught with
[*50*]

2217
8417
Sin he tells you in the words which
are found in the same [chapter] book that
I have spoken of - in speaking to men 
that he knew were deceiving him Who had
worshipped him for the meal of Fishes +
bread that he had given, but  who were 
afterwards convinced of his miracle + feared
him he says to them - " think not that 
I will accuse you - The hour is near
even in the lives of the Youngest in which
they shall see God. - And let me beseech 
you to think even at the Eleventh hour
of the blessings and the peace of mind
that would come from a belief and a
reliance upon him, turn your thoughts
from Earth to Heaven, for if you desire to 
attain that which is earthly, if you 
have ambition and obtain the desired
[*x end*] and wished for distinction here, of what
good will it be to you when every thing
earthly is gone - and the Soul at one
is punished or rewarded what good is wealth
or distinction or Power at a time when
the beggar takes precedence of a King.
When him who died an ignominious 
death upon the scaffold for crimes
imparted to him - who had repented at the
last hour stands before and takes precedence 
of the judge that condemned him, when  
it is easier for a camel to pass through 
the eye of a needle than for the merits of
riches or opulence to be noticed in the
Kingdom of Heaven, and surely it is 
not worth shining for, that,  which you 
can only retain for so short a space as
life, to lose through it that which shall
last you for Eternity -
It is not necessary that life
[*57*]

[*2217 8417*] should be made miserable, that an 
appearance of martyrdom & depression & 
self penalty should be gone through in 
this life to obtain happiness hereafter 
 - it is the reverse - Every pleasure and 
every joy that man can receive is given 
by God and it is not until man yields 
to the temptations offered by the Antagonist 
of Good, that he sinks into sin - And 
the influence of the Holy Spirit must 
ever bring with it calmness sincerity & 
joy to him who will possess it and its 
possession is within the pale of all.

Turn to a belief of Faith a reliance 
on God his mercy and his power 
and the light of his countenance 
descending upon you, His Holy Spirit 
illuming your heart shall guide you 
and bring you safe to his eternal Home

Mr Lea returned thanks & asked if the CA would favor him 
with further advice if requested

[*2218 8418*] I will.

May I ask if my friends GS. Lero is good & powerful 
that is sufficiently so to protect him from Evil 
Spirits attaching themselves to him or his mirror 
or should he discontinue Invoking at present

[*2219 8419*] There is no need to give up communing 
with Spirits that are good

His Guardian Spirit is a good one 
although not powerful, he would 
appear willingly and plainly had he 
those who could see him., but being 
called & having no means of communication 
it appears to them, as though they were 
knowingly called only to be trifled with 
and they go away, and others appear 
in their place, whom the seer is unable
[*52*]

is unable to distinguish from those who 
have left, for being unable to see clearly 
one evil brings about another & the whole 
goes wrong.

It is necessary that his GS. should 
give him a seal the mirror being dedicated 
to him, and the reliance being put on him 
of sending that which is good, and giving 
a seal to the mirror in some degree attaches 
the spirit to it.

Shall I or Mr Lea call Lero.

[*2220*] Mr Lea had better call him

1/4 to 9 the CA left.

Lero's Mirror

Mr Lea. Invoked Lero

12' to 9

It is veiled, Lero is here dressed in black, the same face 
as before but all in black, fastened round the [waist] neck 

Pleased to show &c

[*8421*] S.S

I am Lero

Why do you appear in black

[*8422*] I am not so high as I was

Is that the reason the letters are altered

[*8423*] Yes

Are you A Spirit of the Sun now

[*8424*] Yes

I trust there are hopes of your regaining your lost station

[*8425*] I have done that which makes me less 
powerful.

If I succeed in obtg. the desired Truth will that assist you

[*8426*] Yes

Can you give me a seal to enable my seer to see better 
& prevent evil spirits appearing

[*8427*] I cannot at present

Are you aware of any Evil Spirit [ends?] to attach itself to me

[*8428*] Yes and it is through my not opposing 
them sufficiently that I have lost some of 
my power.
[*53*]

Shall I call you on Tuesdays or Fridays

[*8429*] Try Tuesdays

If you are not able to be seen will you kindly show any Vision 
instructing & interesting to assist my Seers Vision

[*8430*] I will try to do so

If any advice &c

[*8431*] No I have not but if you should be convinced 
of what you have mentioned, and through 
that I should again have my former 
power, you would be able, and I should 
desire it, to dismiss me, from being your 
Guardian Spirit

I am surprized at your remark, being ignorant of Spiritual 
Laws perhaps you will oblige me with your reason.

[*8432*] Another Guardian Spirit would help you 
to progress further, I might hinder you, but 
do not dismiss me until your opinions 
are changed.

As I wish to keep my mirror entirely for your appearance 
will you allow me to have Visions in my [?] Crystal

[*8433*] You can have Visions in it, if you are able 
to see them.

On any Evening

[*8434*] There is no objection to your calling 
I wish to leave now

Mr Lea returned thanks

9 PM.
26 Feb. 1856. CA Mirror 54
Invoked the CA.
The CA is here
WHE Ormerod and WW Moseley have this eve favored me
with a visit will you kindly answer the questions they
may wish to propose

[84]35 2221 I will
When M. Mosely was last here you stated he would become a seer
he wishes to ascertain when he will be able to see

8436 2222 he will be able to see if he tries to develop
the faculty. He might buy a mirror if
the crystal proved unsuccessful.
Can we see PURE Mr. Moseleys GS if we call him in
this Mirror

[8]437 2223 He will appear in the crystal
When Mr. M. is here as indeed with any one in engaged in Spiritualism
he feels a wind  - or current of air as tho' it were blowing [?]
[prism?] Especially his hands.- may I ask if that is
occasioned by Spiritual means or [only] to be attributed to
Nervous Mutability

8438 No answer
have I made myself understood

8439 2224 You have
I will answer you at another time
Is the Influence good or evil

8440 2225 It is not the influence of any spirits
appearing in or connected with this mirror
He should exert his will in opposition to it
MM uses certain means to become clairvoyant may I
ask if those means are in any way prejudicial to his
Spiritual or temporal welfare

8441 2226 They do no harm to the spirit, if you exercise 
control over that with which you
communicate.
I am not aware of his process may I ask if it really
produces Clairvoyance

8442 2227 It does but in all modes of communicating
with that which is beyond the absolute
[*55*]

control of men the greatest care should 
be taken in avoiding any thing which may 
seem to the judgment and reason wrong or 
to have evil influence

No matter how much it may gratify 
to agree with the desires and opinions of those 
engaged - but if the conviction of right 
which every man under every circumstance 
retains - is shocked or repulsed, the action 
whatever that may be should be discontinued

Are the [Globular?] & illuminated or radiant figures I see 
Spirits or optical illusions -

[*2228*] Spirits

Of what class.

[*2229*] Spirits of all classes.

If any &c

[*2230*] I will appear again when Pure has left

The CA's gone

Pure's Crystal (M Moseley's)

Invoked Pure.

The Crystal's veiled here is some one very small, a Spirit 
dressed in white, light hair wings band.

May I ask &c

[*8446*] PURE

Please to show &c

[*8447*] AA

Are you the GS of Mr W Moseley.

[*8448*] I am

Mr M. has called you about 15 times but his Visions has 
not yet become developed. Can you favor him with 
any advice to assist him therein

[*8449*] I believe after a longer use of the Crystal 
he will be able to see Visions

If I obtain a Mirror for him like my Oval Mirror 
& consecrate it to you will you kindly appear therein

[*8450*] Yes

May I request that you will favor him with any
[*56*]

advice upon Spiritual or other matters you may 
deem beneficial to him

[*8451*] I think it would be best for him to begin 
the use of a mirror by calling, or rather asking 
to see lighter visions, than Spirits - because 
being unable at first to see clearly, when a 
Spirit appears after being called and the 
person inspecting is not able [to see] quite 
clearly to distinguish his countenance and 
figure, and is unable to read the answers to 
the questions asked, the Spirit may disappear 
and another appear immediately afterwards 
that he cannot tell from the one just departed 
so that the one who first appeared may be 
very good and the second much lower, and 
it is best when Spirits are called to use the 
exorcism on every fresh appearance.

If I make Mr M. a mirror & consecrate it to you will you 
kindly appear in it to my Seer when I invoke you.

[*8452*] I will appear in it first

I ret thanks & Pure left. 25' to 9 PM.

26 Feb 1856 -

20' to 9 PM. Oval Mirror.

Invoked Castoria

[?] veiled. He is here in white, fastened at the waist. 
& round the neck with the stone bands - wings brown hair 

May I ask

[*8453*] CASTORIA

Please to show &c

[*8454*] I 
AA

Are you still the GS. of Mr. O.

[*8455*] I am

In what way can I best avail myself of your protection

[*8456*] By making more sure your religious faith

Will you point out the errors in my religious creed

[*8457*] You have insufficient faith in the Mercy 
of God and of his Son, and you
the Sont
Leekham on
Friday
[*57*]

erroneously believe in everlasting punishment

Are my views on the Subject of prayer open to objection

[*8458*] The communion of the heart in silence with 
its matter is the surest and safest way 
of obtaining his countenance, and the 
influence of His Holy Spirit - prayer is 
unavailable for deceased persons - neither 
is it desired with form or ceremony.

Although I cannot for a moment believe in apostolic 
succession or the offices of "Priests" as such. - Yet is it 
not necessary that [ministers] there should be ministers 
of religion amongst the ignorant - & [uneducated?]

[*8459*] Ministers of Gods Word are necessary 
Let them be found not as a class, not 
to be paid for their offices - not amongst 
those who in value of their office believe 
themselves to be elect - Let them teach 
others who know most themselves. Who 
feel most faith and at the same time 
humility in the worship of their God

May I ask your view of the doctrine of the 
preexistence of [the] Human Souls

[*8460*] There is one Quantity of human Spirit 
the same now as at the Creation of the 
World.

That Spirit sent into the body cannot 
be destroyed, neither is it made for every 
body that it inhabits, but it is not a 
soul until the regeneration of the Spirit 
it is not the Soul until it comes into 
the presence of GOD after leaving the 
body - and is rewarded or punished

Am I to understand that regeneration of the Spirit 
never takes place until after death.

[*8467*] It does not.

The regeneration of the spirit is the losing 
of all earthly qualities, when every 
earthly quality is gone from the Spirit
[*58*]

and it is pure as it came into the body 
then begins the new life - The second birth 
is the inhabiting of that spirit as a body 
of intelligence in the soul.

What doctrine of future punishment am I to adopt 
instead of the doctrine of an Eternal Hell.

[*8462*] The argument is this

If you allow at the last, that GODs creation 
which he has endowed with the qualities (?) 
of himself falls into the hands of his 
opponent. and becomes his everlastingly. 
You give unto him more power than 
unto GOD for you make him triumph 
Whereas at the last, when the power [?] 
is no longer necessary to ---------
--------- give man the 
option of choosing as a responsible being 
between right and wrong - when all men 
are spiritual and the earth is destroyed 
then will the powers of Evil be destroyed 
with it - and God alone will reign at 
the end as at the beginning -

And again if you believe that the 
Almighty punishes with the most fearful 
torments forever the creation, that in every 
thing known He has shown his unbounded 
Love for - whilst He seeing & knowing 
all and to whom all hearts are open 
looks on and allows them to do through 
human frailty the sins that he afterwards 
punishes them for Eternally. and if 
you believe in him through fear of 
punishment, there cannot be love & reliance 
offered up to him in prayer. -

There is another less objectionable view of Eternal 
Punishment - opposed to the Orthodox. - which makes 
it to consist in being thrown back eternally in the 
scale of progress - may that view be held consistently
See original 
59
with a faith in GOD's Mercy
8463 You mean that after death the Spirit
shall always remain in the atmosphere
— that is impossible — because the Spirit
must be purified of every thing earthly
before it can rise to the presence of GOD.
this purification takes place through the
Seven spheres , and as all must ascend
to him and wait until the termination
of all things ,until the last day to be judged
for it is not until they all become purely
Spiritual — until the last is as spiritual
as the first— that the judgment can take place
and then when they are all perfect alike
the good with the bad — there is either
the reward of remaining in his presence
in perfect happiness for Ever or of being
punished by Committing over again that
which on Earth carried the sin and as
the spirit has the same sensibility and
the same desire for happiness as those who
are rewarded — this punishment is the
keenest that can be givEn.
D. The new that suggested itself to me was this
That man by fulfilling his duty in this life
would be promoted to a higher life after death, and
upon fulfilling his duty in this higher life , to a life
still higher after its completion and so on for Ever
but that by sin — man forfeited this privilege and could
thus be made by the misuse of his Freewill a sufferer
forever by losing his promotion.

HavE I made myself understood
8464 Yes
But Earth is the only place in which
man can exercise his free will, and is
responsible for his doctrines — before he
comes with the world , and there is no lower
State than the world for the Spirit of
The Seventh[?]
[*60*]

Man he is not master of himself 
he is only a part of the existing universal 
spirit, but when he comes into the flesh
and the spirit has greater power than
the flesh, the good has more power than 
the evil - when the good and evil are
combined and the good triumphs over its 
antagonist - then it has done that for 
which it shall be rewarded - but if the Evil 
overcomes the Good and the man falls
then knowingly he has rejected the means
by which he might be saved - but at the 
end of life the responsibility ceases - but 
the actions of the life are recorded and
kept-. There are only seven spheres
between the spirit of God and of Man
disembodied - and whilst he Is passing
through those seven spheres he is neither
doing that which is a good or bad, he is
neither lowering himself or raising himself 
but in the natural course of events he is
being purified for the judgment day.

Are the other planets inhabited by responsible beings
in some degree similar to Man.

[*8465*] They are not.
They are God's Creation but not in the
same position as man. and they are
generally the abodes of spirits that
have not been embodied.

Are the inhabitants of H similar in form to Man

[*8466*] They have no form unless they leave their
world for another, and being spiritual
they have the power of giving sight of
form. - they can embody themselves in
appearance but not in reality-

We are to infer that spirits have the power of rendering
themselves recognized by the indwellers of spheres below
them. by assuming the forms of the Several Spheres
61

8467
It is so - to Spirit from spiritual -
to Man, as a being of Earth, in the Spirit 
world we know each other as a body of
intelligence without matter. - in the material
the intelligence must be clothed to be 
known and recognized by man.

Altho' the relative Gravity of H is so much less than
that of the Earth., Yet it is material how then  
Spirits inhabit a Material body

8468
Spirits inhabit the earth and pass thro'
water. and if they can pass simply 
through walls so they can Exist in a 
complete body of matter.

You describe yourself as a Spirit assuming human 
form to [?] our faculties, may I ask if you 
belong to any particular planet
(Now he shows the letter)

8469
These letters indicate the Sphere to which 
I belong.

May I ask if you, like the C.A. can pass through all
the Spheres.

8470
I go from the 1st to the 5th and from 
the 5th to the Atmosphere.

Is the Sun part of the Spheres & are the planets
included in the orbits of the 7 Spheres

8471
They cannot pass from the spheres 
into the Sun or the planets, or from 
the planets back again to the Spheres
they remain permanently in either
unless they are degraded from the
Spheres and go back into the Sun
or unless they are raised from the 
Sun into the Spheres.
Spirits that do not their duty
in the Spheres are banished entirely
from them., they do not fall from one
sphere into that beneath them.

Have you been a Spirit of the Sun Yourself
62

8472
I have not

Could you give me any Sign that you are my GS
it is a so difficult a thing for the mind to grasp

8473
I cannot make myself felt
Unless I can bring Conviction to your mind
through spiritual means I must remain
as I am - still your guardian, Though
unrecognized I can perform the same
offices

Will you tell me what those offices are

8474
In Life I strengthen as much as
possible your good endeavors, and I
ward off Evil
I can do this without your knowledge
but at death when you need me and
I am at hand when my services are
required then I shall be found ready
and shall be known.

Have you the power to ward off temporal or only
Spiritual Evils

8475
The Origin of all Evil is Spiritual

May I ask how it is the Doctrine of Guardian Spirits
is not insisted upon in the [Xhin?] Revelation

8476
Because it is not necessary
It would have a tendency of leading
Man to rely upon his GS. when his
own efforts alone are to procure him
his award.

May I ask if you have any advice [?] favor me
with before leaving -

8477
I have not now, I would Commune with
You again, and I trust as I feel sure
that under Divine providence I should
be able to bring You to a true view of
the one religion - And that a religion
on which you could rest with confidence
and faith, and not be harrassed by such
conflicting opinions

Invoked the C.A.
The C.A.'s here

its termination - may I receive the [?] this

8481 I gave you that for yourself-I did not

most important parts of the subject it heats
of- and if arising from them you should
desire further elucidation, I will with
pleasure give you my remarks at length
The parts that appear most worthy
of your notice I would willingly answer
your questions upon.
As to "altering in some places-the grammar &c
In giving you my responses I hope
as much as possible to make you
acquainted with my meaning, I am
aware it is often in imperfect words
and you being able to give it to others
grammatically still retaining the
meaning, it is desirable that you
should do so
I would rather give it earnestly
and simply than in doubtful language
however high flown
I explained-
2233 I am [?].
then Mr. Moseley [?] here he informed me that Dr.
Buder a gent who is clairvoyant in his normal.
state- he finished his with a process providing 
clairvoyance in my humor may I ask your
opinion of the process.
Mr. Moseley believes that it produces
2234 clairvoyance - but it only arouses the
faculty which he has strongly within
8484 him for communication with all kinds
of spirits - it would not act in the
some way over those who have not
the power so that 20 might try it +
only one succeed.
Clairvoyance_ which is the entering
of the spirit into the body_ and the
suspension of the spiritual faculties
{ Atmospheric Spirits

The Evil + the good

X Spirit of all them [?]
on the same plane
[*65*]

[*8484*] belonging to it - is dangerous to all 
who cannot control the faculty.

In the first place spirits higher 
than those of the atmosphere cannot 
possibly enter it - were these alone to do 
so all would be well as regards 
spiritual welfare but there are others 
much lower than those of the atmosphere 
who have the same power and are 
ever ready to exert it. - and as they are 
encouraged by the party without his 
knowledge of their class - and having 
once entered it they become the only 
visitors, for after they have been there 
those after them are driven away.

The Globular illuminated spots 
that Mr Moseley sees are these spirits 
undeveloped to his Vision - When he 
gets the power of seeing them, he will 
also see in a mirror or crystal. & 
be in every respect a medium for 
spiritual communication -

When I said that they were 
spirits of all classes - I did not mean 
that they were above the atmosphere

Mr Moseley when here & I believe generally when 
with persons engaged in Spiritual Communications 
feels a current as it were of wind blowing over 
him particularly his hands - you kindly 
promised an explanation.

[*2235 8485*] It is the influence of Spirits over 
him - of inferior spirits desiring to 
make themselves felt and recognized 
that they may act in opposition 
to good.

Mr Moseley being of an 
undecided mind & very imperfect
The faculty - not to be [?]

This had reference to the end times of many a divines [?] known
to us
[*66*]

religious opinions - and very weak will - 
ought all the more strongly to oppose 
the influence of any thing upon his 
body, that may appear Spiritual 
far better receive what conviction he can 
from the Arguments laid open to his 
judgment and reason - but I should 
strongly advise him not to allow their 
influence over him in any way whatever.

I ret'd thanks I remarked my own failure after 
so many years study of Spiritualism being unable 
even in the slightest manner to develop the 
faculty in myself

[*2236 8486*] It is an innate faculty 
It cannot be given or obtained by any 
means of man. neither in many 
cases is it desirable.

If any advice &c.

[*2237 8487*] Two Tuesdays ago when Mr Lea 
was present I was rather injured 
that he did not, & that he never does 
speak of his religion, either objecting 
with Argument to what I have said 
or placing opinions of his own upon 
the Subject - he has never made any 
remark.

Do you think that he will be 
seriously brought to believe in the Divinity

cannot do so.

I explained on behalf of my friend.

[*2238 8488*] I trust that it may be so 
I pray to God that he may be 
brought to believe with faith in His 
Sons redemption - it seems so slight 
an obstacle to belief - that of the 
(bad) lives of men however influential

If they blaspheme the Doctrine

that they preach -- it does not make
it less pure, or less reproachful to them
for doing so -- and if their actions belie

Explanation of the Vision [?]
of my M L -

Spirit passing thru matter

See A W Vol 2
68

[Upon] May I ask the meaning of the Vision we received 
of the Spirit man being formed from the Earth. - & if 
it had any relation to my wish to become a member of 
the F.R.C. called the Invisibles

2242  8492   It was the existence of Spirit in connection 
with Material, showing that nothing 
in creation is too Substantial, too Earthly 
or too minute for the Creation & the 
passage through of Spirits
     one of the Theories of the Rosicrucians 
is that Spirit spring spontaneously 
from matter, as animal[?] does into 
life. -  Through this they recognize 
in great and important things as well 
as in minute and unnecessary.  the 
existance of Spirit without any great 
cause, that is without an intelligent 
law existing to bring by the power of its 
will the Spirit into action.
     Now in this vision although the 
Spirit rose through every kind of material 
and gathered from each its peculiar 
properties you could see that an agency 
was at work that concentrated in the 
being rising the properties from each 
instance necessary for the formation of 
a complete whole, and then having 
from the multitude of Specs centered 
in the object the properties required 
from them. a something is thrown 
back amongst the useless material

I then related the Divisions which took place in 
the mirror & the various actions in each scene - & asked 
the meaning of the Images of the Spirit-Man appearing 
above each.
[*69*]

[*2243 8493*] This Spirit created from the qualities 
of the Earth & made perfect after rising 
to its Surface is seen in the different stages 
of its existance throughout the Vision

These various scenes are those in 
which this Spirit tries to make his 
influence felt, and altho it descends to 
each party in sympathy it does not 
as you observe seem to touch them, only 
to be present as a witness of what it 
desires to effect.

It is the Spirit in its first stage 
mixing with life and receiving knowledge 
through its yet but partly developd 
faculty of separating itself, and of 
being present in different places at the 
same time.

The Spirit in this stage is of 
the Atmosphere - yet perfectly good & 
desiring to raise itself amongst better 
Spirits of a higher order, and yet at 
the same time appertaining by its 
sympathy and love to man.

The classes of Spirits are very 
numerous but if any desire good, they 
cannot but obtain it, if they be not 
positively belonging to the power of Evil.

In the succeeding Vision a Spirit-Man also appeared 
to be formed from myriads of colored specs floating 
in the sea - may I ask its meaning

[*2244 8494*] The same as the Earth it was to 
show that the same Spirit can 
come out of the different Elements & 
that even if its both be in the centre
70
of all Evil, such as the water. it can
by the pure qualities of itself independt
of their influence obtain the same 
Standing as those who receive their being
from a better source.- and in the
whole showing that the life of Spirits
as of Men is not predestined, and
that be their origin what it may, or
their situations provided they exist
between the boundary of the established
law between Good and Evil - they 
are not bound to one course or to one
State - but are through their own 
endeavors, and their own goodness 
to work their way if they so desire it
to the state of those created in perfect
Purity. for the descension and
not [the rising from the spirit material]
from the rising from [the] material of
Spirit - that is - to explain it better
When Spirit descends it comes
from God perfect. but when it ascends
it is through His influence us in
from gross material and therefore
comes away from it with no impurities 
and is obliged to rise by no Efforts
at purification to the state that others
are created in at once
do you understand me.

I thank you - may I now ask the meaning of 
the Divisions in the mirror in which the Image
of the Man Spirit - appeared amongst the actors
in the different scenes.

2245
8495
The Spirit in this view was Several
Stages higher than in the one you
[*71*]

first saw it has received the knowledge 
of its influence in its journeying among 
better Spirits, and this time its 
action is observed amongst the people 
that it descends upon - You see it 
amongst them - and it is beginning 
to make felt its good endeavors in 
attaching itself to them and making 
itself as an instigator of good, in part 
their Guardian

May I ask if the Visions thus shown of the man-Spirit 
rising from Earth & Water are Symbolical - or if Spirits 
of a lower order really rise from the "Spiritual Qualities" 
in matter as depicted

[*2246 8496*] The Spirit of God exists at the foundation 
of every thing created, of every thing 
in Nature - and by the action of His 
Will upon it, it is brought into life 
but still it does not exist perfect in every 
minute part if so, it would be a complete 
Spiritual body. in other Creation as in 
man and therefore to make that complete 
Spiritual existence it is necessary, that 
each part in Nature in which exists 
different properties belonging to the 
Spirit should be brought together and 
and in their union make a complete 
body - and thus showing different 
from the doctrine of the Rosicrucians 
that the Intelligence & the love of 
GOD must be exercised over every 
part that is used in the formation 
of Spirit, for the Spiritual Qualities 
that exist in all the different sections 
of material must be brought together
[*72*] 

in proportionate qualities and the 
same power must be exerted to unite 
these quantities when in exact proportion 
and after making from their continuation 
a spiritual life - to cast back for a 
fresh supply of the same qualities, the 
different portions of Material that are 
no longer required when the Spirit is 
extracted.

Is Spirit then not a simple indivisible quality. but 
a compound of various qualities

[*2247 8497*] Yes. 
How many Qualities exists in Man 
to make one Individual Spirit 
Animation intelligence and life 
and as I have before said the same 
Spirit that exists in man, exists 
disembodied in the whole spiritual 
world - It is only the flesh that 
makes the difference and hinders the 
Communion between the two.

Do those Spirits that rise as depicted from the 
Elements - & are not embodied in man, rise daily 
or have their Spiritual birth at stated periods

[*2248 8498*] They rise sometimes few and sometimes 
many as they are wanted to take 
their share in the progression of all 
things, when men live and it is 
necessary that they should be governed 
by peculiar Spirits, these act and 
it is not until the birth of the individual 
over whom they have power that 
their formation takes place.

2249
8499
The mind of Man must judge the [?]
of his Fellows to form opinions of them
and the books of Jesus are intended to
convey the meaning , "Condemn not that
Ye may not be condemned" 
The actions of Louis Napoleon
must revolt the Sense of right existing
among men, and their judgment on
him must therefore be severe, but he
should be rather looked upon as a
willing Agent in the hands of inferior
Spirits for no man unaided by them
could surmount all difficulties + pass
before the very point of the sword
as he has done. - But if these bad
Spirits finding him a willing agent
for their desp[?]m - have tempted
him to act in obedience to them by
exalting him to the most eminent position
he is responsible for it, for he knows
as well as those who judge him, of
his infamous conduct, and he is also
aware of being under the influence of
what he calls Destiny

2250   8500   rather, Can you think that those
prayers avail themselves with him
to whom they are addressed, is it not
a mockery of Even the term religion
and a blasphemy of the GOD.  to which
that religion ought to lead - But
Still Evil and darkened with Crime
as these men are, and hateful as they
make the form of the religion they
desecrate - does not the Pure faith of
true Christianity appear the very brighter
in its truthful and simple majesty
when unconnected with their mass
of Falsehood and Error.
     It seems to me that it throws
back by its own merit & purity their
false assumptions.

Some time since an At'c Spirit - who Called himself
[the] Louis Napoleon. appeared in our Crystal & said
that he used a Crystal & Seeress & that his G Spirit
was named Jacon. - indeed he often appeared then
called  was that his At'c Spirit -

2251 8501 It was so

I was also informed that whilst Louis Napoleon
is under the Protection of that Spirit, he was safe
from Fire Arms. - but that he would Eventually
lose it.

2252  8502   Probably it will be so for Evil
Spirits always, destroy the tools that
are no longer necessary or useful to
them, they do not give all and
receive nothing in return.

When as mortals we study the Life of the first Napoleon
we find a similar mind - the sole end of his aim
& existence Centered in himself - all self-aggrandizement
Ej + the Dutch [?]ouiral
[*75*]

+ however much we may be astonished at the 
universe power of will + mind such men display
it is but perjury murder [?] on a large
scale. - which make up these "Master Minds"
may I ask your view of his charactor

2252 
8503
I believe his charactor to be very different
from the one who calls himself his
Nephew. - He had a very great desire
of making himself the ruler of the
Civilized World, but to do this he did
not sacrifice like the present one 
Justice and honor. In all his battles
he fought vainly - he did not sacrifice
wantonly human life - or kill without
mercy all that impeded his progress
every action of his life shared a great
and noble but a sadly misdirected
mind - Whilst that of the present
Emperor shows indomitable  courage
and will exercised no matter [?] or
on whom, or by what means so that
his ambition may be satisfied

I say as you are doubtless aware the greatest diference 
to your opinions so kindly + so freely given to me
but I am forced to say that I differ from your
totally on Napoleons Merits - That he was one
of the most extraordinary men that ever lived - it wd
be mere folly to deny.- but his motives were entirely
selfish - the very wish to rule all the Civilized World
without reference to the wishes of the [?] was [?]
but his private letters,  the real touchstone of the man
show that for his own ends - Murder was as
nothing in his eyes.- (see opposite) + plunder his
[?] - 

2253
8504
I do not for a moment consider
Napoleon the 1st
76
him to have been right in any of his
Actions — for of all things that I
desire and know to be for the best is
Equality upon Earth., and I believe that
the fact in itself of one man being
Above others, causes those below to do
more wickedness & Crime from Circumstances
than they would from will, but judging
Napoleon from his life, I believe him
to have acted with more Honor the
the present one.

truly I can easily grant that he had more honor
than one who by no possible logic can be shown
to have been other than a perjurer & a murderer. &
will so leave it —.
About 2 years Since it was intimated to me
that Napoleon x wished to appear in My Mirror
& Vindicate his Character, Circumstances prevented
my allowing this at the time — the Circumstance of
this wishing to appear in the Mirror of So obscure
an individual as myself  -- & for such a purpose
has appeared to me to have been some Singular
illusion or hallucination
2254
8505
Then you do not believe that after
death all distinctions are levelled
that he the Great Emperor is as
humble and as Lowly as the poorest
Soldier killed by his mandate.
— for if you believed this , and think
that he desires to clear himself of Some
acts imputed to him to hi[s]m [memory] on Earth
you must know that the means
of doing so, is only through Spiritual
communication and if the means of
this Spiritual Communication is
[*77*]

limited to so few, why is it strange 
that one of them, and perhaps the 
only one, in which he was ever considered 
of should be chosen by him for 
that Medium

If any &c

10' to 10 PM.

[?]die 18 March 1856 

8 PM. C A Mirror

Invoked the C.A.

Having been closely engaged this week with business I have 
not been able to prepare any questions upon your work on 
Metaphysical Phil'y. - May I ask some others.

[*2255*] I will answer them

A Mr. Brown. of Nottingham has recently published a 
small pamphlet upon Crystal working, he appears only to 
use the powers given by Peter d'Abano & others, & he states that 
he has never seen any Spirits expect those of

[*2256 8508*] If he invokes Spirits from the forms of 
the antient Magi and adhereset o their 
rules - he calls the planetary Spirits 
and they being called, appear and what 
they call spheres is the different ranks 
of Spirits inhabiting the planets.

The knowledge of these Spirts are 
limited to their own station & they conceive 
theres to be the graduated scale of 
existences because they know of no other.

Yet I observe they appear to be aware of things & events 
happening on Earth as he states they have predicted events
[*78*]

of importance which have happened to a friend of his x 
& predicted also others in connection with an approaching 
- revolution in this kingdom - may I ask 
how planetary spirits can do this

[*2257 8509*] They see signs upon Earth, they know 
the future from the present. - for in the 
Natural course of Events, as one thing 
follows another, they can see in the first 
the developing of the next, and in that omens
of the future, but it is [?] Spirits of 
inferior states that know these things, for 
to know them they must be intimately 
concerned with the things taking place 
in the world. -

They are acquainted and make 
themselves intimate with things and forms 
whilst those of a higher state seek only 
to Commune with the intelligence - The 
Spirit [*see 8500*] - This class of Spirits perfectly 
good will make themselves felt & will connect 
themselves with material by writing or 
clapping or even in some cases, by possession

They have the power of doing so but 
the means are open also without the knowledge 
of those giving them to Spirits of the worst 
and the lowest orders, and if one of these 
Good Spirits manifest themselves once, and 
Evil ones take their place, they never do 
so again, it is the same with Clairvoyance 
and with all other Spirit Communication 
through the body

May I ask you the reason why, during the Late Lord Stanhopes 
lifetime - when he invoking Tercho. in his Crystal &
On Sunday  
Capt. H. Murray [&??] Benton (The [?]
visited me at Croydon. In pm requesting the name of this Guardian
Spirit from.

See the following Note.
Sir, 
I must thank you for your kind note which I received
on my return from a visit to Lord Stanhope t& his seer.
Yesterday morning - after along sitting my Guardian
Spirit was called for and his name appeared clearly.
MORO. and he stated he had been my Guardian
Spirit for 20 years.

There is evidently a sad delusion somewhere.
I shall be glad to hear about M Parkyns whenever
you have ascertained the information sought.
Yours Odediently,
H Murray
15 King,
St. James
[*79*]

J. Hunder in mine upon asking the name of the 
Guardian Spirit of the Hble Captn. Murray, we received 
two different names

[*2258 8510*] Capt Murray has only one GS. but he has 
3 attendants, the late Lord Stanhopes Crystal 
was visited by a Spirit of the same class 
as Orion, when he exorcised him properly 
he disappeared but he very seldom did this 
he generally only said

"If you are not the Spirit I called, I 
command you to depart"

he might as well have said nothing

I think you still mistake the 
Answer that I made just now to your 
Question.

When I said these planetary Spirits 
can enter into Communication with man 
through Material means, I did not for a 
moment mean to imply that they were then 
manifesting themselves at the present time 
and who began so thickly in [?] 
they are one and all decidedly Evil

I meant rather that these Spirits 
made themselves known ages ago as well as 
now to those who sought (without a desire for 
any earthly reward,) for knowledge of what 
would have otherwise been beyond their reach 
and they have rapped and made noises 
as omens of death, they have been by their 
actions the foretellers of Important Events 
to the nations of the Earth and they have 
interfered through Clairvoyance to dreams 
in the favor of mortals to whom these
"Theory of Pneumatology. - in reply to the question what ought to 
be believed or disbelieved concerning Presentiments Visions & 
Apparitions - by Dr. Johann Heinrich Jung-Stilling - Translated 
by Samuel Jackson. London Longman 12 [?] 4/10. 1834

Eckartshausen. in the 2nd Edition of his Key to Magic. 1791. page 57 relates 
that a Scotsman, who had learnt the Art from a Jew - Communicated 
to Eckhartshausen & also made the experiment with him -

He that wishes to raise & see any particular Spirit must 
prepare himself for it for some days together both 
Spiritually and physically - a vapour is then produced 
in a room from certain Materials which he will 
propriety does not divulge on account of the dangerous 
abuse which might be made of it - which visibly 
forms itself into a figure which bears a resemblance 
to that which the person wishes to see. -

E. further says - sometime after the departure of the Stranger 
I made the experiment for one of my friends He saw as I 
did and had the same sensations.

The observations we made were these

As soon as the ingredients are thrown into the Chafing 
dish a whitish body forms itself that seems to 
hover above the Chafing dish as large as life

It possesses the likeness of the person whom we 
wished to see, only the visage is of an ashy paleness

On approaching the figure one is conscious of 
a resistance similar to what is felt when going 
against a strong wind which drives one back

If one speaks with it, one remembers no more 
distinctly what is spoken, and when the appearance 
vanishes one feels as if awaking from a dream The 
head is stupified & a contraction is felt in the 
abdomen - It is also very singular that the same 
appearance presents itself when one is in the
[*80*]

appeared danger approaching

They are separate and perfectly distinct 
from the Power of Evil. now so universally felt 
and they will remain when that as sin 
has died.

Heinrich [Jung?] - called [Jung?] Stilling - in his Theory of Pneumatology 
relates that a Scotsman gave to Eckhartshausen a powder 
which being burnt in a Chafing dish - presented the form of 
a deceased person, desired - I have also among my magical 
manuscripts, several formulas for like purposes to which 
I wished at a future time to draw your attention, may 
I ask if you are aware of the Ingredients of Eckhart'ns 
Powder

[*2259 8571*] I was not aware of the particular instance 
you mention, but I know the process. - 
of procuring the appearance of deceased 
people before they lose their form by ascending 
from the Atmosphere into the first Sphere.

Will you to advance my knowledge of Spiritualism, inform 
me of that Process.

[*2260 8572*] If the body of the deceased is buried three 
feet below the Surface of the Ground 
without of course any thing put to preserve 
it, it wd decay in the same length of time 
as the Spirit is after death passing through 
the Atmosphere - This is in ordinary cases 
It is insisted upon by some Spirits as a 
rule but there are many exceptions -

To tell in which state the Spirit 
is you must look at the bones, and if 
they do not upon the air being admitted 
crumble into dust the Spirit is yet 
in the atmosphere and knowing this
dark, or upon looking upon dark objects -

The unpleasantness of this Sensation was the reason 
why I was unwilling to repeat the Experiment although 
often urged to do so by many persons.

A young [person] Gentleman once came to me and 
would perforce see the Phenomenon. - . I made the 
Trial one day after dinner but scarcely had I cast the 
Quantity of ingredients into the Chafing dish when a 
figure presented itself. I was however siezed with such 
a horror that I was obliged to leave the room, I was very 
ill during 3 hours and thought I saw the figure always 
before me - towards Evening after inhaling the fumes of 
Vinegar & drinking it with water I was better again 
but for 3 weeks afterwards I felt a debility, & even now 
when I remember the Circumstance and look for some 
time upon any dark object this Ashy pale figure 
still presents itself very visibly to my sight - after this 
I no longer dared to make any experiments with it

The same Scotsman gave me another powder 
and asserted that if it were burnt in a Churchyard 
during the Night a Multitude of the dead would 
be seen hovering over the Graves; but as this powder 
consisted of narcotic Ingredients which were still more 
potent I never ventured to make the attempt.

Ibid page 202.

Eckhartshausen says he has known people driven mad 
with it.

(The Ingredients are (8) [violently] Narcotic. Consisting of 
Cicala - Hyosciani - Circi - [?] - Opi &c &c see 
[?] Ms. Magical [?] page - )

The 2nd Experiment only consists of 3 ingredients

[?]
[*81*]

You take &c &c. and the form of the 
Spirit comes from the atmosphere & 
appears in the smoke arising from it.

Does it matter of what ingredts the Perfume is composed 
or will the incense do

[*2267 8573*] Yes or myrrh alone, or indeed any other 
pure scent -

I read Eckarthausens narrative of his trying the Experiment 
successfully - but with the unpleasant result of always 
when in the dark or looking at a dark object, having the 
Phantom present & this after a lapse of years.

[*2262 8574*] Indian hemp as in a degree similar 
effects, the Gentleman that appears in your 
Crystal and Mirror and calls himself Mr 
Anderson has used Indian Hemp for this 
purpose, but I think the appearance is 
caused through the Effects upon the imagination 
more than through the appearance of the Spirit 
in reality, any preparation for receiving Spirits 
is perfectly useless - but if after preparing for 
them and thinking strongly about the one 
appearance that you desire, and believing 
from the powerful narcotic the object will 
be seen., the mind is worked almost to a 
frenzy, and the senses being overpressed by 
the vapor., the man believes that he is 
influenced by the Spirit - and the mind 
of the man - being fixed on the one Spirit 
he desires, draws that Spirit towards him 
and by sympathy it makes the Vapor 
assume its shape without its really 
appearing at all. for if it really
[*82*]

appeared and held Communion with him 
it could not possibly appear always afterwards 
for that would be making it an attendant 
on him, instead of a deceased body working 
in another state for its own advantage.

[*2284 8575*] The method that I mentioned [*see also [No.] page 96*] 
actually brings down to the spot the 
Spirit of the deceased person, and then 
without the influence of a narcotic they can 
hold Communion, and it is of the two the 
least objectionable, for when that Spirit 
disappears, it is gone if man desires it 
for ever - its image is gone and it has 
no Power except through his will to 
return - whereas that which exists in 
his imagination and enters with its 
influence into him, may haunt a 
sensitive and nervous person. from its 
always appearing when alone and in darkness 
or seeming to follow everlastingly behind 
- it may haunt him to death -

There are many reasons why I should not wish to 
practice the formula you have kindly given me, the 
more so as I have so much more agreeable methods 
of Invoking the dead. - Yet - may I ask judging from 
Analogy. Could I not by your Formula, cause 
the Ghost of any small animal Bird &c. to appear.

[*2263 8576*] No you must have the Sympathy 
between the two Intelligences - Because 
every Creature in Nature is as distinct 
as Man and the [?] of one particular
[*83*] 

Bird taken from the many that live 
and die could only act upon the individ'l. 
of whom existence they formed part. 
So that that individual one must be 
selected out from the many forms of them 
existing above. and brought down to its 
remains

That difficulty occurred to me when I placed the question 
before you. - may I ask if in the atmospheric world 
there exist the Spiritual forms of Lions Tigers &c as well 
as Domestic Animals.

[*2264 8577*] They do not exist, those only exist that 
were connected with man upon the 
Earth. - and which forms to him his 
World.

I have related the narrative of the Gentleman who saw 
the Ghost of his dog, that had recently died - from Species 
Sights & Sounds -

[*2265 8578*] It is so, that is not the first animal 
form that has appeared after death. 
There is another proof of it, You have 
seen animals in the Crystal You must 
be aware the body cannot enter there.

But we have many very many times seen in our 
visions furniture. Crystals - Tables. indeed the whole 
appurtenances of different mansions - & if forms those 
things have no Spirits - yet we seen them

[*2266 8579*] Yes but there is the distinction between 
life and motion & that which is inanimate 
& still.

May I ask in Elucidation of our Visions, we have seen 
for instance Mr Anderson - with his Crystal in his hand 
with all the Elegant appendages of his Apartments
[*84*]

to have also seen him + many others in laughable
situations - Seen their dialogues = Mr Anderson has also
told us, in his Crystal. I of situations he has seen us
in + even curcimstances we did not wish known - does
then, Our surroundings exist in the atmosphere with
our atmospheric Spirits

2267
8520
The same things exist or rather likeness of
them in connection with your atmospheric
Spirits, and altho they cannot destroy them
or keep them from being as you have them
they have sufficient will and power of exercising
it to alter the things as the appearance at
the same time as it is with you
Supposing Mr Anderson to be looking
Now and desiring to see your atmospheric
Spirit which has so many times appeared
that Spirit on bearing the Atmosphere
would have the option of taking with it
the whole or the half or none of the [?]
by which you are surrounded, but it
could not change them [?] others, altho
it might appear with the same things 
and the same actions belonging to you
Yesterday.

Will you inform me the Name of a Spirit who will
cause the bird-Spirit to appear - according to the formula

2268
8521
You must use the call for deceased persons
Substituting the name of the Spirit for
the deceased Person + making in addition
your request for the appearance of the bid

May I ask the name.

2271   8525   I have not this Evening

1/4 to 10 PM.
                               Oval Mirror
                        Called Mr Anderson
Now hes here in great coat & hat
Good Evening M A I hope you are well 

8526   Good Evening Sir
I thought you were a Gentleman of
Your word - You must recollect if I 
am only an appearance , I have got a 
Memory, about a month ago or a little
more you very politely asked me to
Appear and see you on the following
Friday - You told me You should be
pleased to devote a Friday Evening to

[*See Feb [12] 8"
          p 37
      I did as him
        the follg
           friday *]
86

my presence, I have tried to appear [many]
[times] every Friday Evening since, and have
found you - not at home - altho perfectly
visible in my Crystal =

I explained and asked if when I so appeared I had any
conversation with him

8527
You talked a great deal, told me all about
the Plum Cake business down at Limehouse

Have you used your New Mirror yet.

8528
I have used it, but with very little success
the veil still continues over the front., but I
think every time it gets more transparent
I cant tell the reason why it appears at
all if it desires to remain partly invisible

I will ask the C A the reason. & let you know, but that does
not prevent your dialogue

8529
I cant see the answers.
The reading and all appears behind the 
same veil, I can see the shape of the letters
but it seems to me if they were a little 
darker, they would show thro the 
transparency, sufficient for me to read
     I have no doubt they will do so in
time, I shall not be very well satisfied
if the Veil is not removed entirely, because
there can be no possible reason for a Spirit
trying to conceal any thing which of there
own will they Choose to appear.
 
I explained my views as to the reason, for their not appearing
plainer

8530
If the form is not every way suitable why
not take another, surely they have the 
Power of doing that. if they can take
87

one at all, it seems as though they only
do it to worry me I do get so irritable, what
reason do you think it has for not appearing
without the Vail

I ment'd as to the difference of Sexes

8531   Yes but why not take another form - I do not
think that. - I have ever found there is
something in  Spiritualism in whatever shape or
however beautiful - repulsive to every earthly 
desire - The other evening I am afraid I
drove it away - I could not help it but
after earnestly desiring it to appear plain or
rather make the answers intelligible, I began
to try and exercise my will as strongly as
possible over it - I closed my eyes, from a
sudden impulse I could not resist I 
snatched at it, foolishly thinking that the
strength of the Effort might remove it -
I broke my nail against the glass and when
I looked every vestige of it was gone - That
was the last time 

Do you remember once telling me of an Italian in Germany
shaming you [from] in a vapor caused by having incense
the form of a deceased relative

8532   O yes I recollect, I dont think I shall
forget it in a hurry, from the time I saw
it till the time I went to the Crimea
it was always before my Eyes

I read the CA's Communication upon that subject + asked
if he had ever used Indian hemp for that purpose.

8533   I have smoked it a great many times &
that produces a perfect Spirit World

But not I suppose without great injury to the System
88

It must have a very baneful influence 
but it is most delightful

I should like to try it once

8534   You must begin very cautiously, the first 
time I had about half a german pipeful 
Afterwards I tried more but it is the same 
as opium, each succeeding dose has a weaker 
effect, a strong dose at first would kill any 
one before the effects could be thrown off. 
I dont do it now, because I am afraid, 
I am not so rash as I was

When I asked the CA. for the name of the Spirit who 
would cause the apparition of the Birds - these characters 
appeared - can you see them

8535   Yes

Did you see such in your Crystal

8536   I never have

Shall I tell you the formula 

8537   Is it by Evil means

No

8538    I should like very much to know it, then
You can do it without harm

I consider so, as the bird only would appear.

8539   Yes, but you are mistaken, a spirit appears 
too, you will find, you dont use those 
exorcisms for nothing
You wont succeed so. I believe they have not 
the power of appearing unless influenced 
by a Spirit - in my opinion you might 
as well do circle work, better perhaps because 
you do confine your Spirit and if you 
are nothing more powerful in the call 
than its own name - how are you to get
[*89*]

on with the dismissal - perhaps I 
am shy because I have been so often 
duped - but still precautions should in 
all cases be taken

I thank you much, but I cannot think the CA would 
mislead me - to deal with Evil Spirits

[*8540*] I dont say it is evil but if any Spirit, was to 
visibly appear to you the size of life and remain 
and you found you could not dismiss it 
even were it pure as an archangel, you 
would not desire it -

Have you heard our humane-philadelphian - Louis, has 
got a son.

8541 Yes I have I wish they were all three drowned 
together, and the race of the Napoleons drowned 
for ever. - and yet it seems that he is formed 
by some spiritual means, for he certainly 
knows events before they take place, his whole 
life is so strange and I think he must have 
known when in exile and a prisoner of the events 
that are now taking place.

he formerly use to appear in my Crystal & said he used Crystal 
work. - he is certainly though our "Noble & Gallant Ally" 
nothing but a perjured murderer. -

8542 And yet his wildest ambitious dreams have 
been realized, when he was streaking about 
London in disgrace, it did not seem possible 
that so short a space of time should see 
him Emperor, and the honoured Guest of the 
Queen of England

But perhaps the Pst. would like to try a Coup d'etat here

8543 And then to add one more favour to the many 
fortune has befriended him - Can a
[*90*]

Power that is as we believe Almighty 
look on and allow one man, with the guilt 
of thousands on his head triumph over 
every obstacle and obtain the Proudest 
Eminence in Europe whilst one like 
Robert Owen can live for his age and not 
receive even an answer to a single petition
to Parliament

I alluded to.

[*8544*] I think that's humbug, if he does intend 
it, he will be shot long before he does it 
- It is now late.

I only draw my Conclusions from the Trinity Dinner & the 
threatened marriage with Eunice

[*8545*] It is very probable and one act leads to 
another, if the Sovereign and the people 
are alienated the time may not be far 
distant when England may be a glorious 
Republic, no one sooner than I would 
fight against them as I have against my 
own Country

The People will not allow it, the Army 
are not as in France so completely in 
favor of the Crown.

Yes I will appear

Ret

[*8546*] Well I am very sorry, I wish I could 
flatter myself, that I could do instead 
I cant believe it, If I could I would 
leave Cheltenham for ever. 
Good Night Good Night my

1/4 to 11 PM.
[*91*]

[?]die 25 March 1856 CA Mirror

1/4 to 8 PM Invoked the CA.

Mr Anderson wished me to ask why, when he invokes his G.S. 
in his New Mirror - his GS appears and also the responses 
behind a thick veil - which hinders their being seen or read

[*2272 8547*] Time will develop it, the communications 
of this Spirit are of a higher class than he 
has yet been in the habit of receiving, and 
it is expected he will treat it with deference 
I am not surprized at this feelings, they 
are excusable - the veil will not entirely 
disappear until he has learned to receive 
the Spirit and its Communications with 
the strictest sense of their purity and 
greatness than hitherto

I repeated the CA's observation in his work on Met'l. Philo. 
as to the Spirit, set free by Combustion, of Coals, returning to 
its original matrix to cause fresh coal to form. & urged 
at length the Vegetable Origin of Coal. & the belief that 
once exhausted it will not reform

[*2273 8548*] Coal is a part of the Earth and it increases 
and spreads under the Earth as it is 
consumed - It is impossible it could 
be ever or in any way vegetation - the 
weight of the Earth would make that 
less - or even if it did not get less. there 
would not be a sufficient quantity in the 
Earth provided it did not get longer for 
the supply of the increasing population 
and manufactures to the end of the 
World

It has been calculated by Ecologists that we have Coal 
fields in England sufficient at the present rate of
I forget whose authority the 60,000 years Coal is taken from. - but Ecologists 
like others differ!

[?]
[*92*]

---- Consumption to last us 60,000 years 
And the Coal fields in N. America are so numerous that 
will last for myriads of ages.

[*2274 8549*] I believe the Coalfields are not so large 
as they are [represented] estimated - 
Even if you allow all this to be vegetation 
what an immense quantity is required 
Certainly more than could live on the 
Earth over the mind

According toe the received Mosaic Acct. of the duration of 
the Earth of 6000 years - it could not be so formed but 
before the Creation of Light - 1 Gen v 1 & 2. In the beginning 
God created Heaven & Earth. - & the Earth was void & empty 
and darkness was upon the face of the Deep, and the 
Spirit of GOD moved over the face of the Waters." a 
Sufficient space of time may have elapsed to have 
allowed [suff] the formation from vegetable matter of 
the present Coalfields & their different layers 

[*2275 8550*] but the world did not exist until it was 
needed for its human inhabitants

Not in its present state - but Geology proves that this 
Earth has undergone a long succession of Changes 
each requiring millions of years to develop the various 
species of animal life that once existed on the Earth 
but now only known to us from their fossil remains

[*2276 8551*] You confound the Earth existing in a 
disordered mass with its present shape 
on the body of material from which 
the Earth was Created, there were long 
Creatures and when that material 
was moulded by divine will into 
its present shape the remains of those 
living Creatures went in with it to 
[*93*]

to help make the solid body of the 
Earth. peculiar qualities were not selected 
but the whole taken as it was

But all life was destroyed and 
Vegetation on which those Creatures were 
supported withered up and with their 
flesh and other matter Earth was made 
rich and able to produce in its cultivated 
state the leaf from the seed.

Before the Creation of Adam. did the Chaotic Mass of 
which the Earth was formed revolve round any 
other Sun more or less Elliptical

[*2277 8552*] No it did not the whole universe was 
changed, the Sun was made to light 
the Earth and the Moon. - The mass 
floated about in unlimited space, but 
when creation took place it was brought 
to work upon a perfect system.

On Saturday last I bought Carmichael's disquisitions 
on the Theology & Metaphysics of Scripture - written 
from a Unitarian point of view & in Vol. 1. Chap 2 
he gives the Singular Hypothesis of Mr Bremser on 
the Creation, which I should like to place before you

[*2278 8553*] Do so.

"Researches on the formation of our plant, says Mr Bremser 
have brought the following facts to light - The last ideas
see page. 214 where the Hypothesis slightly abridged is 
placed. - Section 1. - if any remarks -

[*2279 8554*] [*see page 214*] But one universal Spirit did not 
exist before the system of the Universe 
was complete - Life existed limited 
or I should rather say a power of 
motion existed
94
[Quad?] Section 2
2280 In that portion he is quite right, if you
recognize simply the government and
the action of Spirit over material you can
account for all that is yet discovered or
may be from the beginning of Creation to
8555 the End of every thing belonging to it
animate or inanimate is governed and acted
upon and  inhabited by Spirits, its workings
are visible and may be distinguished
as well in produce of the Earth as in
the human form, and the power of
[?] Spirit as easily known by
keeping separate the quantities of the
minerals of the Earth as by giving
motion and strength and elasticity 
to the human being.
[Quad?] Section 3
2281 The author of that speaks of time
elapsing between the different conditions
and formations but that is wrong
8536 the whole as it is now existed at once
but they existed separate and were brought 
together at the same time by the Creator
to make the Earth at once-
[He?] makes the creation of the world by
progression through ages to perfection
but God made it at once by the effort
of His will over existing matter, and
of His will being all powerful could bring
the matter to its present form it must
also be able to place the different quantities
of that matter in whatever form he
95
might have desired
[Quad?] Section [5] 4
2282 But man is the perfection of flesh
and after perfection nothing can exist
and he is perfection because he is
endowed with a likeness of his God
and he is so far superior, so vastly
8557 above everything else in Creation, that 
the State higher than him, which is
the Spirit freed from the flesh mush
be a nearer approach to the God that
he resembles - therefore I say man
being the perfection of Creation - is the
end of it. he is that to which all
things have progressed because in him
[the spirit] the perfect spirit and the 
perfect body are united and the Divine
intelligence exists in the form of Earth.
[Quad?] 5.
2283 It does but that can never produce
8558 any thing greater than animal life
[Quad?] 6
2284 The author makes no distinction between
8559 the lower and the higher animals and
even man - he is quite right as
regards the spontaneous existence
from matter that was once life was
part of the living body but it is only
the most [minute?] of animals that
come in this way. Nothing longer
than worms come spontaneously
96

I read Paragraph 7

2285   8560   There is one error more he only believes in
the spontaneous existence of the first of a
specie, but if one exists without any cause
 save the presence of the combined quantities
necessary for its body, the whole must do so
therefore every one lives in the same way
that belong to the same specie, for no kind
of thing can give that which it does not
receive

Am I to understand that Cheese mites, [?] &
intestinal worms have not the organs of reproduction
furnished them

2286  8561  They have not
They may be all destroyed and again
from the same matter another lot may spring

Can I use the magical Formula you gave me &
raise the bird-spirit without any sin

2287  8562  The mere fact of invoking the spirit to bring
down the appearance you may desire &
of seeing them and being present with them
and communing with them - have nothing 
in them whatever that could be or tend to
evil. -- But there are limits to its use
[* see No
    2260 
    page 80*]

8563  The best gift, and the best power, may be
misapplied and turned into Evil - If from
that spirit you demanded & obtained
information for Evil purposes - or you did
it in connection with him, or desired him
to do that which you knew to be wrong
it would be a responsible act.
     The communion is not evil in itself

97

but by its misuse it may be made so

Mr Anderson was of opinion that the Spirit evoked would 
appear as well as the bird - but that would not be the 
case I presume

2288  8564   The Spirit would be present, whether 
visible depends on the party invoking 
he could be visible if they desired it

In your former response which gave me the formula 
I had so long & earnestly desired relative to the 
Palinginesia of plants. - You stated it could only be 
done by Evil Spirits - it appears to me in my ignorance 
strange that so simple a thing as the reproduction 
of the Spirit or Ghost of the plant should be sinful 
& [not] that of a man or animal not so -

2289   8565   But you must be perfectly aware that 
neither the plant, nor the bird can come 
again into apparent existence unless they 
are guided and governed by spiritual 
means, and altho' in themselves they 
are alike innocent - the Spirit that lives 
in their form is as powerful, as tho' 
existing in the Spirit world in his own 
and as to all things Spirits may 
attach themselves, so Spirits of a different 
Class confine their appearance to man 
in different & separate forms. therefore the 
one that communicates with man and 
assumes the form of a bird, may be 
though inferior - good - those guiding 
and bringing forth flowers may be totally 
Evil

I presume there can be no harm in my attempting
98

the palingenesia of plants [Chynically?]

2290   Of course not.

If any &c.

2291  8566   As you read the work I gave you I wish 
you would note down either objections or 
questions that may arise at the time in 
your mind - I think it is the only way 
at which you can arrive - if all objections 
are removed - at opinions on these subjects 
which have no doubt -
     I am aware that I may have given 
some things that may seem through 
want of a further explanation inconsistent 
and inaccurate - but I know and have 
within me the perfect thought that 
when all connected with it is known 
it shall be indisputable because it is 
right ---  has Mr Ormerod suggested 
any thing else in connection with the 
book you can given him

I intend asking him for his Opinion

2282   8567    Do so

20' past 10 PM   Called Mr Anderson
he is here great Coat  hat  &c

8568   How are you this Evening

I have obtained the CA's Opinion as to your Vision 
shall I read it

8569   Yes if you please

I read the CA's response.
[*99*]

I have never received any Communication 
the same as you do on purely spiritual 
subjects

I mean that I never had a spirit 
that came and devoted his animations 
solely to those matters. - I have asked 
questions of those appearing who have 
also answered the questions relative to any 
other subject that I have asked 
I have never made a point of only 
asking such as related to a particular 
subject or they of answering me.

And I never could obtain thro my Seer any positive 
information relating any personal affairs [thro]

[*8570*] Not if you asked them

No. besides Spirits who know any thing relating to 
this world are necessarily of a very low degree 

[*8571*] I have thought that Spiritual Knowledge 
might comprize all things without 
coming from its station or [?] itself 
that it might see on through time & space 
and back through the past and 
upwards and down if need be into Hell 
to see the workings of all things

[*8572*] Yes but then the Spiritual improvement 
of Man may depend, and does, upon 
earthly Actions, and his transactions upon 
earth. therefore it would seem necessary that 
a spirit being his Guardian should know 
all things connected with him that he 
might guide him concerning them
[*100*]

because if they only tell you what 
you are [afte] to do after death, their influence 
is of no use while you are toiling - it is 
the evil they should prevent.

[*8573*] But they say to them who have not the means 
of Spiritual Communication, that they invite
unto their minds the love of good why not 
point out the good path and leave man 
the option of choosing which he would do

[*8574*] No I mean that when you call upon them 
seriously you might have the option of choosing 
between good and bad - so that you might 
have an opportunity of distinguishing what 
was really good and really bad

No man does a wrong act without knowing it

[*8575*] I think he does, he falls into error and 
is led on thro' things that appear so 
slight at first into difficulties from which 
he cannot extricate himself

Have you bought a copy of Echo yet

[*8576*] Yes I have as a spiritual work it is certainly 
extraordinary and although I agree with 
many things with you, there are some 
that are so new as to make me quite 
undecided, you seem to raise objections to 
an old religion and not to be sufficiently 
clear to form a new one. I only speak 
for myself - I think if you had tried you 
might have made it clearer.

I will do so if I ever print it again
This was a boyish
determinat'n - if I had courage"
[*107*]

[*8577*] Does it cost that to print so small a book

Yes printing pub'g and advertising

[*8578*] You can bring out another Edition when you 
keep your Claret Colored Coach

That I am afraid is only in the Spiritual World not here

[*8579*] I think different

I hope you will prove a true prophet - Miss Selma says 
you have never spoken to her

[*8580*] I was just going to ask what she was doing

She is looking in the E.S. Crystal to try and see her fortune 
Sweetheart

[*8581*] I feel flattered - Can you see me Miss

She sees something but cannot make it out

[*8582*] It must be me, what time do you go to bed

At 11. What time is it by you pray

[*8583*] havent got a watch. What time is it I take 
to go to bed early now I go at 1/2 past 12 
three times a week, it suits my constitution 

Selma says when are you going to bring HH.

[*8584*] You only want to break my heart talking 
about a rival.

Have you seen our old friend Miss Green lately

[*8585*] Not since I came back from the Crimea 
have you

No. Your [four?] friends are easily forgotten 
have you seen the Italian Lady we once called

[*8586*] Josepha Lozzia, she has been dead some 
time you know

That was a most remarkable circumstance you told me 
concerning her (see Vol [?])

[*8587*] But I believe that many things like it 
do happen
[*102*]

The CA told me I could use the end spell, without fear 

[*8588*] do you intend to try it

I think so

[*8589*] I shouldn't I am firmly determined 
never to call any thing out of a vessel 
or mirror, or Crystal. or some means by wch 
they can be confined, of course if they appear 
without my [being] doing so I shall not be 
able to help it, for that I suppose I am 
not answerable.

Your last remarkable relation, surprized me much, but 
then I cannot tell whether you did it as your Atmospheric 
Spirit.

[*8590*] I did it in the body and I never shall be 
able to overcome the dread of Spirits

do you know Mr O_____ or Mr WM.

[*8591*] No how long has he been in the temple 
I haven't seen any friends since I came 
back. I went down to Cheltenham nearly 
as soon as I came home and I have 
been to London a few times since but only 
for a short time.

Is your man servant Belton still with you

[*8592*] Yes why. 
he is the one WH. takes for me

Selma wants to know who WH is

[*8593*] he has told you himself 
he is in the Law and I really think he 
has lost a finger, if not its vastly like it 
No stiff jointed

[Make Penance?] of his Principals

[*8594*] I dont know its only what he's told me
[*103*]

in the Crystal, I am not personally acq 
with the Gentleman. and from his appearance 
there I am not personally ambitious of it 
I have got no friends at all now, I live in 
perfect retirement

Wheres Pa, Ma, & dear Georgina

[*8595*] Gone home - besides, I never lived with them

Why we used to see you all at tea [gether?] & heard your 
conversation

[*8596*] Of course I visited them, I must go now 
I am so afraid of keeping you up. - I 
must tear myself away Miss 
well I can appear any time you know now 
Good night

5' past 11 PM.

[?]die 1 April 1856 CA Mirror

1/4 to 8 PM. Invoked the CA

Invoked for a long time but had no vision the 
mirror not even veiling in the slightest manner.

5 past 8 Oval Mirror

Called Mr Anderson

Mr A is coming but extremely slow. in Blue frock coat 
buttoned. no hat on -

May I ask why you come so slowly, is it not agreeable 
to you to be called

[*8597*] I cannot think what is the matter 
there are spirits about decidedly Evil that 
will scarcely allow me to come at all 
If I was better than I am I should not 
be here -
[*104*]

I have been trying in vain to see the CA - & I am 
much concerned at my failing -

[*8598*] There is a spirit about the same I think 
if not the same - of the same appearance 
with the one that escaped from my vessel 
of water. - have you been calling such a 
one.

No, nor have I any wish to do so - but I am surprized how 
that could prevent my seeing the C.A.

[*8599*] I do not know that they have the power 
but I have always understood and feel 
it to be the case, that the pure one cannot 
approach the evil - If the Evil was here first 
so as to be between you and the Good. I 
believe it wd. have the most power.

Do you think they are now present in this room

[*8600*] I can feel that they are near me

Are you aware the Nena was signed on Sunday

[*8601*] Yes it is Tuesday Evening with me 
Have you discharged that mirror (the CA's)

No I do not discharge the Mirror until I have closed action 
so that the C.A. may still be present & keep off these 
annoyances

[*8602*] I am sorry it has happened so, I can 
scarcely stay here there seems such 
opposition to it

have you seen the spiritual mag. pub by B[?] yet

[*8603*] No I have not how long has it been out 
Is it better than the generality of these 
publications some of them are sad rubbish

Have you seen the Yorkshire Spiritual Telegraph pub'd 
at [Keighley?]

[*8604*] No, but I read all the pamphlets
[*105*]

published in London, and several papers 
from America, there is nothing new at all 
nothing half so interesting as I could get 
myself.

I shall be much pleased when you succeed with your new 
mirror as I expect the responses with much interest

[*8605*] So shall I.

Have you ever read the "Revelations" of St John.

[*8606*] Yes I have

The CA is giving me his view - entirely opposed to their 
divine origin - indeed treating it as well intertwined 
reveries of a good man - like Behmen & Swedenborg

[*8607*] I cannot understand their meaning 
but I have thought that they cannot be 
divine for they seem to me to make the 
religion absurd of which they form a part. 
There can be no possible good attached to 
them, for if their meaning is symbolical 
man cannot in the least understand it 

But it affords a fine opportunity to our pious divines 
now it is no longer allowable to roast men & women alive 
who are opposed to them - to give a good vent to [?] 
by showing the Pope & the [?] Attendant [?] to be Antichrist 
& consequently if they cant be burnt here, they are sure of 
being comfortably damned hereafter. & that eternally.

[*8607*] You are sure that cannot be its true 
meaning - if it has any. I do not look 
to the Bible for religion because nearly 
every part in the one contradicts the other

Do you mean the Old or the New Testament

[*8609*] I mean the old and the new

Where then will you seek the Truths of Christianity

[*8610*] But is Christianity the Truth - [?]
[*106*] 

will arise that cannot be overcome

In a metaphysical subject like religion, doubts necessarily 
arise in the human mind - because it cannot mathematically 
demonstrate those truths - which we may yet implicitly 
believe thro' faith. - By what arguments could I prove 
to a sceptic - that your appearance here & your responses 
are not due to any occult property of my or my Seers 
mind or brain - but that they are derived from a living 
Spiritual intelligence extraneous & unknown to us both -

[*8611*] But as regards religion there is so much 
reason to doubt, there are so many conflicting 
opinions each strong on its own side 
I can believe in God, the immortality 
of the Soul - in His Mercy - and in the 
salvation of the world. 
I have believed that it is to take place 
through the merits of his Son & of the 
Virgin Mary - 
I have had a strange Vision in my 
small crystal, purely on religion and if 
it has gone far to shake the faith that 
I once had, but I do not place sole 
reliance on it for it may be the means 
of unsettling my doctrine only to 
make me decided in favor of a 
stronger and perhaps better one that 
may be given or revealed through the 
spiritual means of the large mirror

I explained my view of the State of the World, in a religious 
sense at the time of JC's Birth & the necessity for his 
appearing to place Man in the True way. & asked if 
Mr A could give me the Spirits remarks referred to
[*107*]

[*8612*] A spirit appeared rather indistinctly 
but sufficiently plain for me to be sure 
that it was good. - but it seemed rather as 
the likeness of a Spirit, than one in 
reality, it seemed rigid and heavy - it was 
surrounded by great brightness that increased 
at its head. I had never seen it before 
after a short time during which I had 
exorcised it 3 times very strongly. - it told 
me without my addressing it, that it was 
the likeness and the influence of a Spirit 
that was a Ministering Angel at the 
time of the Birth of Jesus Christ and that 
it had come to point out to me, the errors 
of my Creed and of others partly belonging 
to the same sect.

I did not answer, and it continued 
at some length if you will just wait 
a moment I will fetch the notes, I 
made, of course I could not take all 
down.

I shall be much obliged by your doing so

Now hes gone (9' to 9.) now hes coming - (about 3 minutes) 

he's got some papers in his hand

It then said

[*8613*] "Why believe in Jesus Christ as the 
Son of God and the founder of the only 
true religion - do not the meaning of his 
own words show that he comes to bring 
dissension and strife not peace and 
concord upon Earth and after his 
appearance - does not there rise conflicting

[*108*] 

[*8613*] Opinions - Spiritual Battles - hatred 
and disunion where otherwise might 
have been expected a calm - while have 
not men greater than he appeared in 
all ages - and shown by their actions 
their purity and goodness like meteors 
across the darkness of ignorance - 
as one mans life is an exemplification 
of Crime so may anothers be of goodness 
and yet neither may be derived from 
one source either good or evil.

Jesus Christ is made perfect 
by the virtues of his life - more than by 
his own actions - He had like all 
other pretenders, those around him 
that he convinced and made his followers 
his power over them was sufficiently 
great to make them faithful to his 
memory - and if they wrote his life 
it cannot be expected that they would 
do other than praise - Yet even this 
praise is in some measure borrowed 
for they connect what they write with 
a book written long before & they make 
him the fulfillment of Prophecies that 
were vague and of [theams?] that only 
existed with the men that uttered them 

Now Mr A's pulling the papers about as tho' he could hardly 
read it in some places - Mr A. said

[*8614*] You must recollect that I had to read 
besides, write, he then continues -

Was not the religion that existed before
[*109*]

[*8614*] his time [?] more simple and 
indisputable to the mind of men, when recognized 
only as what was known, to the reason and to 
the heart and to the sympathy existing between 
the creator and the created - This sympathy 
is sufficiently powerful to bring them together 
The undeniable power of a Supreme cause 
is stamped upon every object that lives and 
breathes and moves, and the nature of his 
power is known by the universal intelligence 
the only intelligence, and that embodied in 
man & as like follows like and kind 
seeks [like] kind - through multitudes of 
objects different from its species - this 
intelligence in man rises to its source 
and acknowledges from its own likeness 
the living GOD, and in this intelligence 
as there exists knowledge of right and wrong 
so there is also the knowledge of responsibility 
[the disembodied intelligence after death] 
for either action, and for these actions as 
a responsible being the disembodied 
intelligence after death is either reward 
or punished - there is no medium 
between GOD and man as he made 
the creation so he best knows how to end 
it. and how to bring it in the end to 
His first purpose - 

Then he said

[*8615*] You object to this because you believe 
the Creator to be a being so vastly superior 
as not to comprehend the wants and
[*110*] 

the feelings of men - but if the rest 
of creation so much less important than 
man is provided for without even an 
instinct - of any other than their own 
existence - how much more close to 
him must be those that are endowed 
with such special qualities as the knowledge 
of a Supreme Will - and all nature shows 
that not one effort made at the beginning 
serves to keep it, in its perfect state 
of progress but that efforts are 
continually made, that an ever 
watchful, ever acting power is at work 
to make all come in their due season 
that one may follow another. that 
not one thing may be without life 
and that it may all lend to one 
great end, by joining man to him 
and by glorifying him in their sight

That is all.

I am much obliged by your communication I hope 
in your new mirror when spirits appear to deliver their 
views on doctrinal points you will strongly exorcise them

[*8616*] I do so, this may be the dawn of light 
or it may be only the means of shaking 
my former belief. that I may be more 
ready to receive new - at all events it 
does shake opinions - for with me it is 
impossible to see things - or have them 
permanently impressed upon me by 
what appears simple and true must 
have weight and I cannot help
[*111*]

placing a reliance on what is so 
strongly urged and comes from a 
source apparently good - Even if many 
come and they are all contradictory - I 
believe in one partly until the next 
comes and again changes it -

I will if you please read an address delivered by the 
CA to a friend of mine whose religious opinions 
are as unsatisfactory & unsettled as yours. 
I then read the CA's address (page) to Mr. Lea

[*8617*] The CA's are beautifully simple 
You can understand them at once 
as you proceed, how different in every 
respect from the one I have received 
and yet both directed to the same 
object -

I explained and hoped I should hear the responses 
of the Veiled Spirit in his Mirror

[*8618*] You should know all

When I appear again and you have time 
and it is convenient I shall be much 
pleased to hear more of the Metaphysical 
Work you have received, and I hope by 
that time to be able to give you the 
first communications from the mirror

I will leave now

Do you think the Evil Spirits - have left the room 

[*8619*] I think they have.

Accept my thanks & good wishes

[*8620*] Thank you and accept the same 
yourself as they always put it in the 
letters

1/4 to 11 P.M.
[*112*]

[?8die 8th April 1855 CA mirror

Invoked the C

The CA is here in white as usual. Purple robe. &c

I regretted exceedingly on being unable to receive your comm'ns. 
last Tuesday Evening. particularly after receiving Mr Andersons 
statement that it was caused by the presence of Evil Spirits

[*2293 8621*] I could not appear because there was an 
Evil Spirit present between you & me

I took the precaution this Ev'g. to exorcise before I commenced

[*2294 8622*] There are none present now

May I ask if it arises from my having slept 2 nights at my 
friend HS?

[*2295 8623*] It does. The Spirit is attached to him and 
will continue so until he can receive with 
[?] and faith the principles of religion 
revealed to all who will seek it.

I cannot conceive how this Spirit [has] attached itself to me as 
I always exorcise if I think any are near me.

[*2296 8624*] It did not attach itself to you but tried to do 
so, it is gone now and I trust will keep away 
but I have a power of preventing it from either 
influencing you or harming you unless you 
willingly enter into Communion with it - this 
I am sure you will not do, but from its 
being present when you are present, it repels 
me to a distance and obliges me to do 
- away - that which otherwise I should do 
when present - Act in all things as I 
know to be for your good.

But against an Invisible Spirit - which may as this did 
came uncalled - how am I to guard.

[*2297 8625*] I must give you another Exorcism for it 
I will give it you next Tuesday Evening 
Believe me it is not from the least unkind 
feeling - or from any desire to leave you. that 
my appearance is not visible at a time 
when it seems most needful - present or absent 
known & recognized - unknown & disbelieved in
[*113*]

a Guardian Spirit is still the same

I am gratified to hear that Mr A. will succeed with his New 
Mirror. I receive those spiritual instructions from which 
thro your kindness I have recd so much pleasure & inf[?]

[*2298 8626*] He has received the first communication from 
his Mirror from a pure and good Spirit 
his Guardian Angel, and his doctrines 
are those of truth - the only ones held by those 
of his order or above him.

It must have been since Tuesday last

[*2299 8627*] he did on Thursday.

When he came in on Tuesday Evg. he told me that he 
had recd. a commn. from a Spirit, which had very much 
unsettled his previous views - the Spirits doctrine being 
directed against the Divinity of J.C.

[*2300 8628*] That was not a spirit it was an image 
It was the image of a picture existing upon 
Earth brought from the Atmosphere not by 
Evil Spirits nor by his Guardian Spirit 
and the doctrines it gave are but arguments

In what manner or for what purpose could the reflex of 
our Earthly painting so appear - & apparently give the 
response he read to me. which however erroneous was 
a consistent one

[*2301 8629*] It was given for a good purpose, that of 
showing him by the difference of the 
doctrines given hereafter, the weakness and 
insufficiency of that.

May I ask the name of his GS.

[*2302*] Constantine

Is that the same Spirit - that was formerly the GS of my 
Seer Emma - & also. the Spirit of one of my Crystals

[*2303*] Yes

When formerly I was in the habit of calling many difft. 
Spirits as [?] [Holo?] & [Mo?] &particularly my GS 
Hunder - & my faith was so unsettled - why did 
I not then receive the Doctrines of the True religion

[*2304 8632*] The power of communication was not
114
developed, and Hunder is a Spirit of the
Sun who could not give you in Language
sufficiently expressed for you to understand
his knowledge.
does not the Change which has taken
place in your views seem to tell you that
a minister of religion was necessary, that
Minister could not be found for you amongst
those of Earth—-   All men may be guided
by direct or indirect means. to the truth
if they seek after it , and sincerely desire
it —   each is open to conviction in his
own peculiar way . and is it surprising
that the only means open should be
used to convince him ,by those who seek
only to minister from GOD to man.

I returned thanks & observed how desirable it w.d be, if some
means Could be devised by which Professor Newman
the author of The Phases of Faith —  could be convinced of
his error. - he appears in that work so sincere a preacher after
Faith_     
2305
8633
The same Agency is acting for these invisible
as myself, but if they cannot communicate with
that agency — and if they would not if
they could, how can it make itself seen
and felt .— It would need a special
Providence to Change their opinions
And if the merit of Sincerity deserves such
interposition surely Robert Owen would
not remain thus long unconvinced

There are some passages in that [?] written book. which
I should like to place before you & solicit your views
2306
8634
I will give you my opinion of individual
Parts but as a whole his opinions are
so Entirely opposed to Spiritual knowledge
as to seem although a well written book
in Every passage and in Every part but a
mass of error. Error it seems to me so
palpable  that no one Even the most
15

ignorant after having sought assistance
of the Almighty could for one moment read
and believe.

I have re-read Professor Blakey's Work on Metaphysical
Authors. I find [them] [as] your view of Plato & Aristotle
agrees with his. May I ask how you are aware of
the arguments & writings of those great men.

2307
8635
They are the greatest Metaphysicians
the world has produced - the greatest -
considering them to have lived in remote
ages and having to struggle with difficulties
in Forming Theories which many now
only partially copy & make additions to.
It was only to illustrate my remarks
on the ignorance of even the greatest minds
that I spoke of them - of others I should
have done the same.

You mention in Your Metaphysical Work
"Something cannot be created out of nothing, however
"great a power may be, that power must have something
"to work upon that shall feel its power and be made
Subservient to its Will." This is an axiom - clearly
distinct for more so than An axiom [?] = & it leads me
to ask if you believe that Matter has always existed -
has been & Consequently Ever will be Eternal. -

2308
8636
Matter has existed so to say from all Eternity
but not in either its quantity or its quality
As at the time of the Creation
Matter increased until it got sufficient
for the purposes of Creation, and then the
same power that had caused it to increase
- a power of expansion - causes it now to keep
in separate bodies, the different portions of
material one distinct from the other.
- I spoke in the beginning of that
book of their being in all things Created
life - Life is forever. - active or passive
Active because of - superior quality and
greater quantity - passive because
a See. Mary Somerville's Connection of the Physical Sciences 
Article Nebula page 421.

Laplan supposed "That originally the whole system 
constituted only one vast mass of nebulous matter being 
expanded into the thinnest vapor and gas by heat 
and more than filling the space at present occupied 
by the plants - This vapor had a revolution from 
West to East on an axis, as the heat diminished by 
radiation, the Nebulous matter condensed, & consequently 
the velocity of rotation increased and an exterior zone 
of vapor might be detached since the central attraction 
might not be able to overcome the increased centrifugal 
force this ring of vapor might sometimes retain its 
original form as in the case of Saturns ring, but the 
tendency would be in general to divide into several 
masses which by coalescing again would form a single 
mass having a revolution about the Sun [?] its 
axis. This would constitute a planet in a state 
of vapor, & by the detachment of successive rings might 
all the planets be produced - as they went on 
contracting by the same Law satellites might be 
formed to each, and the ultimate results would be
[*116*]

regenerated and diminished - I mean
universal life - the same by which man
lives and moves and breathes and by which
the earth preserves separate and distinct
the bodies of the different substances of which
it is composed - and yet in both alike
it is power and the same on one as in
the other - But that which in man
joined to his intelligence and Spiritual
body makes so perfect a being, as in its
lowest state so degenerate, so  poor and
so weak as scarcely to be known for the
same principle

I thank you - having adopted the Theory of Laplace
that the origin of our Solar System "Which he conceived
to be formed by the successive condensations of a nebula
who[?] rotation is still maintained in the
rotation and revolution of the Sun and all the bodies
of the Solar System in the same direction - What there is
now presumptive Evidence in the structure and informal
heat of the Earth, of its having been at one period in
a gaseous state from intensely high temperature" a
and altho this  gaseous state however subtle is still matter
Yet that it may [?] in like [?] been only a [?]

2309
8637
No the first particles of Matter existed for
ever, as I have before said however mighty
the will it cannot Create something out
of Nothing - they must have something
to centre them.  They must have something
to form in or confine them.

As for their form it is known that a Mass of the same
density whose particles mutually gravitate to each other
will assume the form of a sphere when at rest. but if
the sphere begins to revolve every particle will descate
a circle hang its centre in the axis of Revolution -

But to do this there must be an
atmosphere The atmosphere was created
Solid Planets and Satellites revolving around
the Sun in nearly the same plane, and in the
same direction and also on their axes.

after the Earth and the system of the
Planets after that.

This Earth which we inhabit is part of what we call "our
 Solar System = Consisting of the Sun - estimated to be 354,936
times larger than our Earth. - & having revolving round it
☿  ♀︎  [Earth symbol] ♂︎ ♃  ♄ ♅  &  ♆   & of these planets the [Earth symbol]  is the smallest
except two. - Now altho' as far as our Solar System is
Concerned we may taking  [?] for our authority believe
that the Entire system was Created [solely] as a secondary
object to mans appearance upon the Earth. - but what
are we to think of those bodies termed fixed stars & now
deemed to be the Suns of other Systems. similar to our
own. Yet placed at such an immense distance from us
that altho astronimers calculate the aphelion of ♆ 
to                       miles distant from the Sun. Yet
the place of the nearest fixed star cannot be estimated
within an error of       millions of miles beyond ♆ which
may I ask - allowing that our whole solar system was Created
out of the Chaotic Mass by Gods Will = If the fixed stars
or Suns of other systems. Were then already in Existence
& obeying his Laws -

2311  8639   They were not existing - nothing existed
but that from which the world was
created - those stars are in the spheres
but far above them is the 7th and that
is now the same as before the Creation
there - is no Evidence of any thing
existing [before Spirit] except Spirit

But if the highest fixed star is             millions of
miles from our Sun. - the distance of the farthest
is of course beyond any human conception

2312  8640  But you must think that the 7th
Sphere is above them because if not
you encase even the Supreme being in
Space - and however far they may
be off - that Space is limited

The chief objection to [the] Mans being the sole object
of such an immensity of Creative Energy is his
[*118*]

his comparative insignificance - when even the volume of the 
earth which he inhabits sinks into a spec compared with 
the space contained even within the orbit of [?] how small 
then must it be when it is only a spec in a system which 
is but a spec in the great systems of the fixed stars, & which 
judging by Analogy Astronomers suppose to be inhabited 
by Sentient beings in some measure like ourselves.

[*2313 8641*] And do they also believe that the inhabitants 
of those other worlds are greater than man 
that is being endowed with superior 
qualities - because if so, if you judge 
from size how vastly superior must be 
the inhabitants of the sun to man.

And if so superior you must reject 
the evidence given of His coming to the 
little world to save man. When He 
might have gone to a larger and done good 
to Man. for all Creation must be the 
same in the Eyes of Him who made it 
and all those inhabitants possessing 
His Spirit must be as deserving of His 
Mercy - [and] He would not create things 
without a Cause - He would not create 
any thing that might not be brought 
at the end of all things to His presence there 
to make a perfect whole

If you believe that he sends a 
Son to each world to die for the Sins of 
each people or to give them the one light 
which in all cases, could only lead 
to the one End that of His own glory 
you utterly destroy that of His own glory 
you utterly destroy the Evidence because 
you contradict the assertion - that of 
Christ being His only Son.

But the Inhabitants of those [?] Systems 
might be Spirits - not inclined to Sin - & consequently 
not needing a redemption by Sacrifice

[*2314 8642*] It is not so - Man must be the
The C A's reply as to the  [image]
[*119*]

most perfect in all creation or why should 
He make Himself - Man - and if Spirits 
are without sin why should they exist 
apart from Him - there is room enough 
in His presence

To my limited notions - the fact of man being the 
ultimate end of the Creation - of such vast systems - is as 
though. a huge Oak had lived a thousand years to 
produce only a single acorn -

[*2315 8643*] It is so - but if that [single] acorn 
possessed the Spirit of [its Maker] the 
Creator - is it not greater than the 
Substance of the whole tree that bears it.

If renew the Subject of the Apocalypse on Tuesday next

[*8644 2316*] Yes

If any objections to my sleeping at [Linehouse?]

[*2317 8645*] I do not wish to influence you in things 
of no importance

I will appear next Tuesday & give you 
a dismissal expressly for Spirits unconnected 
with the Crystal or Mirror, or even visible 
appearance.

If I call Mr Anderson

[*8646 2318*] Yes

1/2 past 8 PM.

Oval Mirror

Called Mr Anderson

25' to 10 PM. He is here in blue frock coat. [led?] stripe 
down the Trousers. no hat

Good Evg. Mr A I hope you are well

[*8647*] Quite well I thank you

I am pleased to hear of your success with your new 
mirror. Will you favor me with the results

[*8648*] Yes. but I must detain [them] you a moment 
If I go and fetch them.

Now hes marched off - he goes out [the] he gets quite 
small - it looks as tho' he walked upon nothing
120

here he comes, turning the leaves over hes got a small
red book - in scarlet cloth. now he says

8649   I began looking at 9 oclock and I sat
there till a quarter to 10 before any thing
came at all - the mirror began to veil
not the usual veiling - generally
before the appearance of a Spirit it only
appears opaque and cloudy but this was
as though a thick curtain of that stuff
You lined the Evani Glass with, you
remember - falling close against the front
and it gradually rose. not dispersed 
and underneath it the space was quite
clear, the light was very dazzling a
single figure was there of very large size
so large that [I commenced by exorcising]
surrounded by excessive light, it was
almost startling,  I exorcised it rigorously
and not until 5' past 10 did it answer
my first question - I asked if it was
my Guardian Spirit

Now he's turned over a leaf

8650  Yes
And the name 
                        Constantine
There was two or three strokes under the name
I asked of what order   there then came distinctly
A A with the I over.  the strokes were simply
thus  [illustration]  Well then I asked him
(it had the appearance of a male
spirit -- & dressed in exceedingly beautiful 
Robes.  with fair hair and a circlet of
stones -- purple in his hair  the same
round his neck and his robe confined
with the same at his waist -- not
dark enough for what we would call
a good amethyst  they are the color of
121

8650   The drawing of some stones that I have
seen illustrating the Bible -- paler than
Amethyst. I asked him
if I did right in dedicating the mirror to him
and if by that means I could depend
on the Communications made from it, as
being only those of himself or of any 
Spirit that he might specially send
He said that I might-
     That is office of Guardian Spirit
Consisted in watching over my welfare
temporal and spiritual   that the ills of 
one and bad effects upon the other, that
being a responsible agent, for every action
the Soul must suffer for those actions 
Committed in the body, and that it was
necessary when Evil was to that body
at hand. I should be warned of it by 
him.
     The duties of his Office to the Spirit
Could be performed by him perfectly as
well unseen and unknown, as present
and visible, but still it was desirable
that all who had the means of communicating
with spirits should with proper precaution
use them.  to the greatest of their ability
and that though the means of this Communication
that might be done for man in life
which in other cases must take place
after death -- he said how much best
it was to have the Aid and Counsel of
friends  that he could depend upon by
being greater in their knowledge and
goodness than himself, and although he
might not value them in this life, the
Necessity of them would be obvious in
the next -- that he did not desire to
influence me except by the means used
from man to man that of making
apparent to the reason and intellect
the truths of the arguments and admitted
from its consistency and inherent goodness

This was all he said then
I was very much pleased because I 
think it opens so favorably & auspiciously
our intercourse

I feel now how much better it is
to have no demonstration of their power
or to have their influence felt upon the
body.

You Present [?] was formerly the God of 

Constantine
my Seer --

Is he shall I nok

Yes do so

I will    it was 1/2 past 12 before that came
that I have read to you and then it
left. 

Have you noticed what days you are to Invoke

No I have not but what days do you think 
it best to call

Tuesdays & Fridays with me

do you know whether they will appear
in the day time in the large Mirror

I will inquire

I will now read the Continuation of the [Ca's?] book on
Metaphysics -- I read it to the [?d?]

It is certainly a beautiful treatise
I never have heard of any thing like
it coming from such a Source, it is 
so new, so different from what is [?]
by men, even the most learned, but I 
wonder why he singles out Plato & 
Aristotle from the philosophers of Old
I have always thought Socrates was
superior to either in Metaphysics
[*123*]

But Plato was the pupil of Socrates.

[*8656*] That made me think that as from 
him Plato desired most of his information 
he would have been spoken of as the 
source and therefore the greatest. [*As to my changed views - *] 
I trust that in time I shall receive the 
same impressions there seems the same 
prospects of it -

The CA has promised me an Exorcism - to prevent the 
occurrence again as on last Tuesday, & I shall be 
happy to give it you

[*8657*] Thank You

I shall call Constantine on [?]die Evening 
again and then ask him if he prefers 
any other day and on Tuesday I shall 
be able to give you his Communication 
if it is convenient for you to call me.

Selma wishes to try if she can regain her Vision, it 
is [?] that having once seen it should be lost.

[*8658*] It does seem strange

Will you appear to her in the ES. Crystal

[*8659*] Yes I will appear.

Selma looked in Earl Stanhope Crystal & Mr Anderson 
left the Mirror - but she could not see him nor 
could Emma who looked over her shoulder. 
Emma then looked in the Oval Mirror & Mr Anderson 
entered

[*8660*] I tried to appear 
I think that however far advanced 
the Communications with Spirits we 
shall never understand them.

Have you bought [Bartlaws?] Spiritual Telegraph yet

[*8661*] No - I am going to London on Friday 
very likely shall stay to the following 
Monday, then I will get it.

Cant you run down & see me at Croydon

[*8662*] I dont know where to come to

You can find me very easily if you come
[*124*]

[*8663*] I should like to see you in the body 
I think we shall meet

How is our fair friend Mrs. Powell

[*8664*] Mrs. & Master Powell are quite well as far as 
I concerned

Is he still the image of his Father -

[*8664*] Oh of course - you should see the urchin

Next Tuesday you may as well bring him in & show him 
to us

[*8665*] I will

Have you got your little dog [Zeno?] & the Newfoundland Bill

[*8666*] Gengy has got the little dog in Spain 
with her. I have got the large one

I think about getting married, I am 
going to London to see some friends, I expect 
theres a good lot of money.

Is the Lady Young not well as Rich

[*8667*] Nearly 3 & 30. - about that I dont know 
exactly, at all events I shall be here on 
Monday night and you shall hear all 
about it - I am not at all particular 
to age, I would have had Miss Green if 
she would have had me. 
I suppose its getting late

Yes only 10' to 11.

Will give you one Effectual when all others 
fail.

May I ask you to dispel the cloud which renders your answers 
Indistinct -
The CA has a paper in his hand which he is unfolding and 
there is writing upon it - & the CA says

2319 
8670
In the usual form for dismissing Evil Spirits 
much depends upon the power of the person's 
Will. - If this be not sufficiently strong 
it does not in some cases take effect - or 
it may be evaded by them. But in this 
dismissal You appeal to God feeling sure 
that His influence can reach them in 
whatever shape or place.

Now the CA is opening the paper before him taking hold 
of it at the top - there is written on it

Merciful God dismiss my Enemies, send 
down the mighty influence of thy Holy 
Spirit to dispel all Evil -
Protect me when the temptations of 
the powers of Evil are over me through sin 
Known to me as Sin - but above all 
save me from them when they would 
lead me into danger without my Knowledge 
or my Will -
Guide and direct me so to seek

[*Mr F. Hockley ?*]


[*124*]

I have received this letter from a Gentleman [?]
unknown to me.  As it doubtless carries out of Your
Respones given [?] Mr Owens late work - may I read
it to you - I ask your advice as to answering it.

2322
8673
I can see it
I do not know who it is from.

I read the letter

2323
8674
I do not know him, neither can I [?]
how he wishes me to understand his
Meaning of Mission
Is he a Spiritualist - does he mean
a divine Mission - because there is no
such thing of Man himself knowing
that he has a mission to fulfill between
God and his fellowmen.
Many are the instruments of 
Divine Providence, but they are not
inspired - neither do they know they
are performing more than what they
believe to be the right and truthful
Way -.

From the construction of Mr Barmby's letter it is at
first doubtful what his meaning really is, but I
think he can only mean - Your Mission-

2324
8675
I think he means his own mission 
but you can answer it for both ways.

2325
8676
It will be best to say. that you have
shown his letter to me. that I have
no knowledge of him furthur than 
that letter contains. and that I
cannot rightly understand whether he
means his own mission or mine.
but in either care to be pure and
good as man may, be, and however
Christian his doctrine the fact of 
his being mortal must prevent him
from having a Mission on Earth

[*127*]

2325
8677
For to have a Mission and to be able to
fulfill it Man must be a personificatn
of the Almighty, throughout life he
must be kept inspired, and must be
again God made man even as Jesus
Christ -.
If it is my Mission, granted
that I am a humble instrument by
which the knowledge of God may be
given to Man - but I am purely
Spiritual and as that, free to live a
perfect existence - because there is no
Sin, no temptation in my state.-
or to come among men for the [?]
of guiding them. to the source from
which I obtain my Spiritual life +
Station
That the time is at hand when
the Communication of Men with Spirits
of a high order will be frequent and 
intimate I have no doubt and I
believe they will promulgate the one
doctrine whose Echo shall be formed
in every heart. And that before the 
Consummation of all things they will
present themselves to men without 
any Mediums - Even as shining lights
in the Air-
That the Evidence they bring
will dispel all conflicting opinions from
the Minds of Men. and that the whole 
Earth shall be of one opinion + of one 
Faith - and that made known to them 
by the true Ministers of Christ. -
The Influence of the Holy Spirit
over the hearts and minds of Men
is felt by all who pray earnestly
[*128*]

and heartily to GOD for it, and who 
act consistent with their prayers.

Those who with humility yet 
strong faith believe that He is ever 
present and watchful, and that He 
makes the light of his countenance 
to shine on that which is made by 
them pleasing in his sight -

Sincere prayer will bring 
unmistakeable Evidence of His existence 
and power, and that evidence is 
the working of His Will in its 
[?] of the Spirit in Man -

Mr G. [Gilkes?] who formerly felt great distrust in 
the Truth of Your Spiritual Apparition - has lately 
expressed his Convictions are quite changed. he 
last week attended the deathbed of a young friend 
& from Circumstances attending his decease he is 
desirous of ascertaining his friends state of spiritual 
Welfare & happiness - may I call him by your 
sanction on Next Tuesday Evg.

[*2326 8678*] It is not advisable to call one so 
lately deceased - If Mir Gilkes is 
convinced, I am much pleased, for 
it shows that the influence of good 
however simple has prevailed at last 
- and do that strongly & safely - 
which Evil might do speedily and 
with destruction

I will then defer calling his late friend until 
you give your sanction.

As to Mr Dresser & my Wish not to act uncourteously 
towards him as at present I must appear to do.

[*2327 8679*] I think courtesy a duty among all 
people, and the surest means of 
obtaining respect and Esteem. I am 
aware that you have seemed to
[*129*]

Violate it as regards Mr Dresser and 
you may with safety now either write 
to him or call upon him - he will I 
am sure readily receive your explanation. 
It would be better that he should 
be an acquaintance. than a friend

As my Seer sees this Evg with difficulty I will 
not. trouble you for the Cont'n of your remarks 
upon the apocalypse - May I ask if any &c

[*2328 8680*] You had better use the dismissal 
I have given you while you are at 
Mr Leas house - If at present the 
cause cannot be destroyed, the 
consequences may be prevented 
under any circumstances it will prove 
effectual, and will with the blessings 
of God bring His peace which indeed 
passeth all understanding

May I mention - that when you have left this 
Mirror. & I commence calling in my mirrors or 
crystals, I do not discharge - Your Mirror - because 
I think your influence is stronger - Mr Anderson 
the other Evening observed he thought otherwise may 
I ask you which is best.

[*2329 8681*] When I leave this mirror I am no 
longer present in it - but when visibly 
present here, I am no nearer you 
than I am when unseen, therefore 
it makes not the slightest difference 
this is only the means of making 
me visible.

After a considerable time the Mirror slightly

Seer perceived there was a communication read
[*131*]

[*2330 - 8682 - *]

"The Crowned Angel would willingly hold 
Communion with you but the means of his 
doing so, are for the present gone - but remember 
though not visible he is still your guardian 
Angel, and attached to you, and will still 
continue to use all his power for your Spiritual 
and temporal welfare, and to regain the Communion 
between you which has now been so long 
Established, believe me it is not any fault 
of yours that prevents my appearance. You 
have done your best in all things - the same

At Spirits in only.

Invoked the CA

The CA is here as usual in white purple robes crown

Agreeable to your kind promise I have this Evg. 
Invoked your appearance, but in endeavoring to 
avail myself of your offer. - I must first ask if 
as I fear this is to be the last time [*of my Seer seeing it*] of your 
appearing that I may propose my questions 
accordingly

[*2334 
8686*] At one time even as late as last 
Tuesday week, I was almost certain 
that she would not - I made that 
communication to you knowing that 
you would be anxious and feel deep 
regret at the apparent loss.

I promised you that I would 
appear this Evening and I then though 
for the last time knowing that you 
were about to leave this place for a 
short time I intended to see you to 
do all in my power to make an 
earthly parting less painful and 
to give you at face such instructions 
and advice as I might think necessary 
for your future guidance
[*134*]

But while I felt all but certain 
this would be my last visit I still 
exerted every power in your behalf that we 
might continue to communicate by the 
means which we had done, now for so long 
a time - You will with myself be pleased 
to hear that they are successful and 
that after your return from your journey 
your communication with Spirits will 
be the same as before, but you will not 
be able to communicate with them until 
after the first Tuesday in August.

I returned thanks & said that as the Visions were to be 
continued - my questions (prepared) were rendered 
unnecessary.

[*2335 
8687*] I will answer your Questions this Evg. 
and you must ask all that you will want 
answered during that time

On the my friend Mr Lea sent me this 
Commn. stating that you had appeared in his 
Mirror on [?]die 15 April at the same moment that 
you were also in my mirror I gave him the follg. 
advice (a) - May I ask if you really so appeared 
to my friend Lea's wife - or can it be possible that 
another Spirit assumed your appearance.

[*2336 
8688*] I have not appeared on Mr Lea's mirror 
since the time he came to you here 
neither shall I do so again unless 
called by you. -

A fortnight before he came to 
you I desired that he should do so 
since the address given by me to him 
I have had no Communication with 
him, tell him this that he may 
not be further [obsessed] decieved.
recs Leen Letter
whilst working this
1/4 past 7 [?] 28/6/56
[*135*]

May I read his Communication

[*8689 2337*] Yes

I read the Communication

[*2338 
8690*] No Spirit can be in two places at once 
he may go from one to another as 
quick as thought, but when present 
in one place he cannot be seen in another 
[if] that Spirit somewhat resembled 
me - but it is impossible that it could 
have had my likeness, my stones and 
shape of my Crown - it must have 
been the same that so often appeared 
to the Earl Stanhope when alive, but 
you can discover this -

On the back of the Stone that 
fastens my robe the front of which 
has my order upon it - are the symbols 
of Angelic faith. The mark of them 
is known to no man, neither can 
any other Spirit assume it except those 
who have risen to their Eminence thro' 
the merits of their faith the sign of 
which is here, I will show you this 
mark provided you do not show it 
either to Spirits or to those using Crystals 
or mirrors for the present. but particularly 
in Mr Lea's case.

When that Spirit appears 
demand, and if he does not appear 
call him by the title he has assumed 
ask him without letting Mr Lea 
know it or any one belonging to him 
so that their minds may not be 
occupied -

Ask him first to show you the 
letters [?] on the stone that fastens his 
Robe - These are mine are

I
AA
[*136*]

[*2338 
8691*] having done this ask him to turn 
the Stone, simply say please to turn 
the Stone" and mentally Command 
him to do so in the name of the 
Almighty God - if he does not do so 
or turns it and any thing Else appears 
on the back - you must be certain 
then. - it is the only means of convincing 
you that it is not me. but be particular 
in not letting Mr Lea or his Seer. or 
any one in his house, know any 
thing at all about it. do not even 
write it upon the book that you take 
with you for there are Spirits about 
as well as mortals

Command him to show it 
Mentally and after you are satisfied 
tell them no further than that we 
are not the same.

May I ask your opinion as to his Changing his GS. 
Lero is desirous that he should consent to his 
discharge - Knowing the great benefit I recd. 
when I exchanged the Guardianship of Hunder 
for your own. - I am desirous that my friend 
should obtain a GS. of a higher order & a purer 
faith - shall I advise him to do so as I did 
in Similar Circumstances

[*2339 
8692*] Lero is much lower than he was 
formerly at it may be that he 
desires to get Mr Lea a lower instead 
of a better guardian Spirit - he must 
not trust to him

The Seal which I have given 
you will, I am sure show you that 
he is deceived - and if as I believe it 
to be - it is Lero's wish to induce him 
accept a still lower Spirit - that it
a ,The Jaspar Crystal,
[*137*]

[*2339 
8692*] Lero's wish to propose that this C.A. 
resembling me should be his GS. 
he would be much worse than the 
present.

Your advice is best, and if he 
can pray earnestly he will find 
things much changed.

But when this Spirit appears 
representing me you can ask Mrs. 
Lea to make a drawing of the Stone 
and bring it away with you it 
will be best for you to go next Tuesday 
evening if nothing occurs to prevent 
it - but do not upon any account 
call Spirits yourself and whilst 
you are there use the dismissal 
for evil Spirits that I gave you 
sometime since

Dr Kenneth R H MacKenzie is desirous of investg. 
the Occult Laws of Spiritualism & as he is 
a Gentleman, learned in kindred Subjects I 
should like with your permission to further 
his Views by lending my my ES. Crystal 
& giving him the Necessary Instructions

[*2340 
8693*] You can do so but give him the 
Instructions with it - The Calling 
dismissal and Exorcism

As I have not Evoked for sometime the 
Spirit of this Crystal [*-a-*], may I ask who is 
now attached to it

[*8494 2341*] Constantine

If Dr MacKenzie finds a Seer. Will Constantine 
be willing to show the required visions to them.

[*2342 
8695*] He will he is a very Kind Spirit 
and a good one, it would be best 
But he should call for those 
first trying, visions of light things
2[1?]43
8696

These talismans were written on Vellum - & were
reverified by placing against the M close to the CA's Seal
When the Seeress remarked that a ray of intensely
bright light descended from the CA.  & in a few
seconds the CA. replied  I have so &c.
138

or people living, things calculated rather 
to interest than alarm or sadden the 
person Inspecting, and when the party is 
found that can see these lighter visions 
the Spirit himself can be called and 
after that deceased people.

As I am shortly going into the North will you 
Kindly reanimate my Talismans

2343   8696   I have done so, and earnestly I pray 
that God will bless you and empower me 
to protect you from all danger.

At the Commence't. of your Work on Metaphysical 
& Spiritual Philosophy - you give as a Syllogism

2344    8697   "Where there is life, there also is Spirit. 
"In all things created there is life 
"Therefore in all things there exists Spirit"

May I ask if you included in the 2nd proposition - 
The Vital principal or Germinating power of Vegetables.

2345   8698   I do, Every thing from the most minute 
blade of Grass - springing from a particle 
of Earth. was created by GOD. therefore 
it has life -
     Life is Spirit so far that it 
cannot be destroyed - it is the same 
existing in or out of the substance 
In Substance it is Animating Power 
Out of Substance it is Spirit - That is 
Invisible Power in the same Quantity 
& Quality ready to animate the same 
kind of material.

But may I ask  if I take a Single Ear of Wheat 
possessed of its Spiritual or Germinating power & 
plant it it will produce about 30 times - its number 
& weight - of grains which also in due course sown 
will reproduce until several acres may be 
covered with the produce of that original grain 
Each possessed, apparently - with the same Vigor 
& Germinating power. - Life or Spirit - from
[?] This Hermetic R.C. doctrine is continually 
affirmed by the CA. & especially in - the original 
copy of the CA's manuscript on Met. & Spl. 
Philosophy - it appeared as a note or Comment, 
upon my thoughts unexpressed - whilst 
recg the translation.
[*139*]

Whence - [whence] does that increase of Spirit-Life 
Emanate.

[*2346 
8699*] The increase of Spirit in one Part comes 
from the decrease in another - the Same 
Quantity of Spirit exists now as at the 
beginning - as the Material increases 
the power of the Spirit within it increases 
and every ear of Corn has to go thro' 
the same process as the first, before it 
can bring forth more. You put the 
first seed in the ground and the Spirit 
comes out of that Seed into a certain 
quantity and no more, one stalk and 
one Ear and the Spirit of the parent seed 
increases with the growth. and by the 
time that it has ripened and falls 
down again into Seed there is sufficient 
Spirit to bring forth. from each of those 
Seeds the like number as at first 

But you may ask if if Seeds 
Spring from one and each has the 
same quantity if Seed it requires 
at times the amount to make them 
Equal to the first - it is so - because 
the great quantity of old Seed that is 
taken away to be used by Man when 
it is dry, emits its Spirit and the 
Spirit that gives out of the Corn that 
is eaten by Man as food goes by 
Sympathy back to that which is 
Germinating in the ground.*

But may not the same Argument be used in 
Respect to Man. = when we consider that the 
whole human race now about 1000 millions have 
sprung from a single pair -

[*2347 
8700*] That is different

I have said that it is the same
[*140*]

Spirit that inhabits all things and 
that Spirit is the Power of God. but it 
is far different in quantity & quality 
in Man, than it is in the rest of Creation 
for Man is as far above the rest of 
Creation as GOD is above Man

Therefore Man has - besides the 
Spirit of the Universe - The Emanations 
of Divinity - a Special Spirit of GOD.

Upon this Subject you also say "It is the same &c *a* 
I read the passage

[*2348 
8701*] It is so.

Does any thing doubtful arise to you 
from that.

If you do not think that the 
Laws of Nature - GODs Laws - provide 
a certain amount of Spirit for each 
portion of Creation and divides that 
again into Minute Species, how do 
account for the Invariable of 
kind producing kind even in what 
appears the most worthless of Vegetation 
how is it that when you sow wheat 
the wild poppy springs up amongst 
it unknown to Man who sets as he 
believes all wheat and year after year 
the ground is turned up and you 
would imagine all Seed had disappeared

If you do not account for it in 
this way how is it that flowers year 
after year are of the same sort and the 
same color.

How is it the rose is not blue 
and the Lilly red there is no more 
Red in the Root than there is blue 
from which the blossom springs

And does it not show the
[*141*] Law that exists, the rule that is laid 
down by the Almighty for his Creation 
that the predominant color of [Creation] 
vegetation is green - because Green 
is most required to cool with its thick 
Shade and Calm soothing Color the 
heat of the Sun.

Yes every portion of Creation shows the beneficence 
of the Creator.

[*2349 8702*] And also an Unvaried Law

As I have learnt from you. that our Commns. 
are to be continued after the [?] Tuesday in Augt. 
The questions I had prepared - are rendered unnecy. 
May I ask. if we shall then receive the promised 
explanations of the [?] Antiquities and 
the Apocalypse of St. John.

[*2350 
8703*] Yes all will be continued the same 
I am willing to answer any questions 
that may [I] arise in your mind

Any thing that you may have 
doubt upon or interest in. I will as 
far as possible forward. there is no 
reason for your withdrawing a question 
because you may deem it trivial 
and if Mr Mackenzie should wish to 
ask any questions. I am willing to 
answer them.

I returned thanks

[*2351 
8704*] You mentioned when I appeared before 
that Mr Gilkes was desirous of putting 
some I am willing to answer them.

May I ask - if when alone I make certain requests 
to you. Are you cognizant of them

[*2352

1st Invocation for
Miss A
[*144*]

Monday July 7, 1856.

Went by appointment with Dr Mackenzie to Mr. 
Croslands and took the crystal, there were present 
Mr. ONeil Mr. and Mrs. Crosland & Miss A 
self and Mr.

About eight oclock I took the crystal from its box 
and placed it on the table near Miss R on 
presenting it to her for examination her fingers 
became rigid and I was obliged to remove it, or 
she would have certainly passed into the mesmeric 
state, I distinctly felt while taking the crystal 
away how rigid her hands had become.

It was presently suggested that she should look 
into it, and although the crystal had not been 
charged, she saw a vision in it as follows -

[*8714*] I see four spirits carrying a canopy the 
canopy is red, I cannot tell what it 
means, now there are six spirits, the 
supports of the canopy are wreathed 
with flowers, and the spirits are strewing 
flowers about.

I cannot give the exact words as Miss A merely 
spoke generally, and had not really [convinced?]

At, 8.20. P.M. however Mr. Hockley charged the crystal 
and invoked Constantine to shew a vision and 
answer any questions which might be put.

Miss A the seeress then spoke as follows.

[*8715*] I see a large rock rising up; the base 
of which is washed by a roughe sea. I 
seem to hear the waters roar, the spirit 
lands upon a rock and a Scroll which 
he is unfolding -

Mr. can you read it.

[*8716*] "The Outer is part of the Inner therefore 
trust and be not fearful, but trust,

See RX 8798. An explanation by the C. A. of the
names assumed by these "Intelligences"

;Blue,

[*145*]

[*8717*] It is for you.

The spirit looked at Mrs. Crosland who had hold of 
the seers hand.

Miss A said that after the word "Inner" there 
appeared a kind of arabesque or illuminated 
letter

Mr Hockley - Will the spirit be kind enough to tell 
us its name.

[*8718*] Vision indistinct.

Will Constantine be pleased to make the writing 
plainer

[*8719*] I am Faithful.

Will the spirit show what order he belongs to 

Show the stone in front of the robe.

Asked three times.

A scroll appeared of a blue colour with letters of 
five.

[*8720*] Wait. 

The sun is now shining on the sea, a 
gleam of light falls upon it, it is 
increasing very considerably.

Repeated the last question.

[*8721*] I am of the "order of Intelligences" 
sent upon earth, since the Ascension 
of our Saviour as a comforter unto man

Are you the G.S. of Mrs.

[*8722*] Yes - one.

How many others has she.

[*8723*] At the present time five.

Will Faithful kindly give their names.

[*8724*] Integrity, Trust, Firmness, and 
Comprehensiveness

Mr. Hockley took the seers hand.

Will Faithful be pleased to communicate.

[*8725*] Yes.

In blue letters.

If he should be developed as a medium.

8726   It is elevating to the spirit, it is 
reducing to the body,  Judge for yourself 
if the spiritual elevation compensates
for the bodily infirmity,  judiciously
followed you have nothing to fear.

Am I adopting the right course to banish the
evil influences that have beset me.

8727  In the faith and strength of our
Lord Jesus Christ can you stand.

What G.S. has Mr. ONeil

8728   Devotion is one - Justice and Nehemiah

Is Phreno one of the society which communicates
with Mr. ONeil -- and if so which of them.

8729   Yes  (in topaz)

Under what name.

8730  Elevation.

Mr. Hockley  if Mrs. C takes the seers hand will she
be able to see.

8731  Yes she can see but not now, the brain
must gather strength ere it will be
healthy for the spiritual literature
to open to the physical organ.

If I lend Miss A________  my Japan Crystal will
you appear in it and prevent evil spirits from
appearing in it.

8732  I and Innocence will protect it.
there is much more sunshine coming
Faithful stands out bolder like a
statue, 

Mr [ONeil]  C  wishes to know as to wether he is right
in mesmerizing the seer.

8733  Yes - (in pink.)

How often should he do so, and when, and on
what days.

8734  Alternate.

How long should Mr. [Croiland?] mesmerize her

8735  Half an hour.


[*147*]

Mr. Crosland wishes to know if you would 
kindly tell him how may G.S.s he has and 
what name's they bear.

[*8736*] You have four now - another will 
shortly attend you, the names are 
Activity, Gratitude, Feeling and 
Independence

Mr. Hockley - From the novelty of the subject to the 
seer it is somewhat fatiguing - may I be permitted 
to ask if Mrs. Crosland inspect, will she be to see.

[*8737*] For her spiritual health - I may not at 
present.

The seer being fatigued it is proposed to wait 
a short time - how long shall we wait.

[*8738*] A quarter of an hour will be ample

7 to 9 oclock.

10 past 9

Mr. MacKenzie wishes to know whether he is acting 
rightly in his behavior towards, and treatment 
of Spiritualism.

[*8739*] The earnest spirit is always right 
if it act in accordance with the 
light within

Mr. MacKenzie would like to know if he would be 
able to see in the Crystal.

[*8740*] Yes, Constantine can help him.

Would his health be affected by the practice.

[*8741*] If enthusiastically followed.

I what manner would Mr. C. be able to check 
his irritability of temper.

[*8742*] Pray to the Lord Jesus Christ and you 
shall have inward peace.

In whose custody would it be best that the Japan 
Chrystal should remain Miss N or Mr. C 
- should it no be Mr. C.

[*8743*] Yes.
[*148*]

[*8744*] I see a vision of [muscle?], in wich I look 
rigid. It means that I could not touch 
the crystal.

Who is the spirit of the Japan crystal now, will 
Faithful and Inocence be sufficient.

[*8745*] We will watch over the seer, the crystal 
is safe.

Will you be kind enough to inform Mr. C 
when he should use the crystal, what days 
and hours.

[*8746*] Sundays at three, always before the 
shades of evening.

Mr. Hockley returned our thanks and asked 
Faithful to be so kind as to request Gratitude. 
on her leaving, to appear in the Crystal.

[*8747*] Yes.

Please to accept our thanks.

[*8748*] Faithful waves her hand. and 
a shower of light falls down. that is her farewell

20 past. 9.

Invoked Gratitude.

[*8749*] Gratitude is here in a robe of shineing 
globular substance joined 
together, her [?] is blue, and the 
wreath or crown upon her head is 
formed of pink and white flowers 
there is a light from the flowers - 
 she stands on a sort of cloud.

Will Gratitude be pleased to inform us to 
what order she belongs.

[*8750*] The spirit has not got a scroll like 
Faithful, her lips move, wait a 
moment.

I am one of those who minister 
to man.

Mr. wished to know whether he was right.
[*149*]

in publishing his Theory of Apparitions

[*8751*] It is a glimmer of light shining in 
a dark corner.

What do you mean by the dark corner.

[*8752*] The dark corner is the final end of 
the Material condition of the earth. 
The medium being lived we waited 
five minutes.

Gratitude will you kindly ask Constantine 
to us after you leave.

[*8753*] I will.

Please to accept our thanks for appearing.

[*8754*] He is gone

1/2 past 9.

9' to 10.

Invoked Constantine.

I see a figure but it is dime at present

The seer inspected for a minute or two and 
then fell forward in a mesmeric state. the 
light of Constantine being too powerful.

10, 5. P.M.

Invoked Faithful

[*8755*] She is here in blue, there is the 
rock and sea, on her head is a 
diadem of sapphire and topazes

What is the meaning of your appearing to 
us standing upon a rock.

[*8756*] To teach you that if you are faithful 
the whole world shall not prevail 
against you.

Mr. Hockley I recently invoked Constantine 
and the seer became mesmerized will 
you kindly tell us why.

[*8757*] Because the Atmosphere is new 
and powerful to the seer.
[*150*]

Would it be better if I lent Mr. C- my 
oval mirror

[*8758*] Decidedly no.

Will you and Innocence guard the mirror 
and exclude evil Spirits from it.

[*8759*] The seer has no fear and we will 
protect her.

What days and hours shall they use the O.M.

[*8760*] Not too frequently. 

On the alternate days to those on 
which she is mesmerized.

Seven oclock, because the seer should 
be in bed by nine.

Faithful, you answered us in different 
colours, what is the Typical meaning of 
those colours in general.

[*8761*] Everything seen by the seer is typical 
of an attribute of the Spirit then 
manifesting itself.....or 
the feelings promting the idea

In our extreme desire to profit by your 
communications we have lost a few words 
of your reply, will you be kind enough to 
repeat them.

[*8762*] Another time.

Mr. Kenneth Mackenzie who has hold of my 
seers hand, wishes to know wether at any 
time he will be able to see.

[*8763*] Yes, but I cannot define the period 

Mr. K. M. requests you to show a vision of 
where Mr. G R Gliddon now is.

[*8764*] I dont know what Faithful is doing

It is not my sphere of ministry

Please to accept our thanks.

She is gone.

10.17. PM.
[*151*]

[?]die 12 August 1856

Invoked the CA.

1/4 to 8 PM. CA Mirror

The CA is here as usual. in white purple robes &c.

I am gratified by your appearance. & trust it will 
now be for a continuance - accept my tanks &c

[*2362 
8765*] I am pleased to communicate 
with you once more, and shall 
continue to appear on Tuesday 
Evenings when called as before

May I ask the cause of my Seer losing her 
Vision

[*2363 
8766*] I cannot tell you now I will do 
so at another time.

In pursuance of your instructions I called the 
Spirit in Mr Leas Mirror calling himself the CA 
he at once appeared & declared himself to be my 
Guardian Spirit - but upon requesting him to 
shew &c. I found it totally different.

[*2364 
8767*] I cannot, neither can many other 
Spirits show the back of that Seal 
unless it be to those with whom 
we are nearly Connected and when 
it is necessary for Identifying us

As such a means it is infallible 
and you must keep it strictly 
to yourself. for you may want 
it again

That Spirit appearing in Mr. 
Leas Mirror and so boldly 
asserting himself to be one with 
me. must show you the nature 
of the generality of those with 
whom [we] Mr Lea communicates & 
it also shows how guarded and
152
scrupulous in his dealings with
Spirits must be the Man who
could use only that which is right
and for right purposes.

I mentioned that when my friend Lea was calling
one evg. & a letter of mine laying on his Table
Lero mentioned the Contents. [& when I was there]
gave him a Remedy for my Spasms — but
which I had not used — fearing I might thereby
come in some measure under his influence
2365
8768
It proves him to be of a low order
but still remedies purely medicinal
such as are known to be good for
the Complaint they heal of might
be taken without harm the remedy
coming from that source might
be as good as a remedy as tho'
it came from a physician, but
in all cases they should not be
trusted alone — if you know their
advice to be harmless , you might
take it with benefit—but if they
recommended that which seemed
to your Judgment strange or ill
adapted for the Case. then let no
influence that. they can exact
move you to do their will
I speak generally not in
your particular Case.

I replied that altho the Remedy was Simple + the
ingredients I believed efficacious I did not intend
using it for fear of any occult influence
2366
8769
In a case like that it would not be so
You would merely use the remedy
suggested by them as though it
KRHM's note 
of the 21 Septr 1882 9 30 PM 
when I was reading opposite

Fairies [*2370 8773*]

There are not such Spirits as a class, there 
are none that are confined to flowers or 
that are really so minute - they have 
appeared so to men. Spiritual Essence 
has been presented in the Size of a fly 
to the appearance before man

It has been so for some purpose 
& has been used as an agent for convincing 
and impressing him with their existence
[*153*]

came from a different source, not 
placing faith in them but in the 
prescription as a cure for the Complaint

It is not until you desire that 
they should interfere and cure you 
with their means that you become 
connected with them, but it is best 
whenever the means of cure can be 
obtained from other sources to have 
it and not until that has failed 
by their advice.

I mentioned to you before that I have formed 
an acquaintance with Dr K R H Mackenzie. and 
as he has become a convert to Spiritualism 
I am going to make him a Magic Mirror 
for his use - he is desirous of being presence 
at a Seance - may I with your approval 
name Tuesday Evg next.

[*2367 8770*] I am quite willing to appear

I mentioned at length my visit to Mr Croslands 
at Blackheath. my meeting Miss A. & the 
tenor of the Communications [?] the E.S Crystal

[*2368 
8771*] The Spirits that you saw there 
are of the same kind as Mr. 
Moseley's Guardian Spirit "Pure" 
and they were good

If I then go to Blackheath on a Tuesday 
or Friday Evening will you kindly consent 
to appear.

[*8772 2379*] Yes.

In most civilized countries there exists Traditions 
that a Class of Spirits exist - so minute that they 
revel in & under the blossoms of flowers - & [?] 
many [?] tales are [connect.?] - Termed in this 
country Fairies - May I ask if any such Spirits 
really Exist - see response opposite -
[*154*]

They do not exist as such in the 
Spirit World

In passing from one Subject to another may 
I observe that in your work on Metaphysical 
Philosophy you say "If God is the only 
Intelligence that is perfect now, the other Spheres 
being created since Man" Am I to understd. 
that man was created before Angels & Spirits

[*2371 
8774*] The Spheres were created after Man 
because they are the receptacle of his 
Soul in its passage to that first 
intelligence, and until those Spheres 
were created for man, the Heavenly 
Host which were part of the 
divinity or rather Emanations of 
the Divinity, did not descend; until 
Creation took place - 
- It was unnecessary that they 
should do so. - but at the time 
of Creation when Man was made 
and the after life was considered 
and provided for - it was necessary 
that then Emanations of Divinity 
should come down as invisible 
Messengers to and from Him and 
His great work

The Bible tells of the Fall 
of one of these he was turned out 
from Paradise & from the present of 
GOD, and descended to make by 
his own sin and his own [Images?] by 
the head of that place to which his 
followers in Evil should hereafter 
dwell

In descending he lost none
[*155*]

of his greatness. but his nature was 
changed - changed by its contact 
with matter - and then began the 
War of Power against Power - a 
war that will continue in Spirit 
and in Man each against its Kind 
until the whole shall be again as 
at the beginning, and the Divinity 
be found Master of all

An apparently [interminable?] Subject for dispute 
amongst men - "on the Origin of Evil" - suggest 
my asking you now of it - arising out of your 
last response.

If the "Fallen Angel" was originally an 
Emanation from the Divinity" he must necessarily 
have been All-good - tho' not all powerful. how 
then could a being thus all perfect & a divine 
Emanation = conceive - origination or become 
contaminated by Sin = - [to put?] could be the 
Nature of that. "Original Sun" which has since 
caused so much Misery to Man.

[*2372 
8775*] The Divinity was then as now, [Powerful] 
Perfect as a Whole - Perfect as a body 
Perfect as the great cause and the 
Head of all things know and 
existing - and powerful as it was 
Perfect. for in its power existed its 
Perfection and being joined as one 
body there could be no discussion 
but when the one body separates & 
gives out a power - that Emanation 
is not so powerful as the body from 
which it comes - it is not all powerful 
and when it finds itself inferior to
156
another, even be that other of the
Same nature, there is if I may so
express it a desire - [?] for
the same height [?] the 
as great as the power from which it
comes - and with a loss of power
comes weakness -

That insufficiency and
weakness was allowed by the [?]
Perfect Divinity - more was caused
by him indirectly to become sin
for it must be remembered that
when this Emanation from himself
was descending to do good to his
Creation He had power ove rit that
he might have con???ed it & kept
it in all things the same as
himself -

But this Creation had an
Aim it was not an object without
an End. and the soul was not
an after thought. So that it was
necessary that one of these members
of this body should fall away from
him and become gradually lost
to his qualities - for if it were not
so the scheme of Redemption that
must then have been known were
made useless and [?]

May I observe - that if they only suffered who
sinned - the justice would be obvious - but every
day life shows us - that it is the apparent
guiltless who suffer - say children - who suffer
hunger. Want. - [?] ???thsome starting [?]
The result of the [?] of their parents or Even grandfathers
[?] Original,  so nearly?
[*157*]

2373
8776
The sufferings that you speak of are
caused by Man, and originate with him
at the very time when the almighty
established himself as the perfection of all
goodness, and the fallen angel the
greatest of all Evil - he places man as
a separate and distinct being so nearly [*?x*]
between the two good and evil and
gives man such an amount of His own
good qualities as to make him a 
reasonable being he gives the judgment
of discerning between that above and
below him[self] - the knowledge of
right and wrong He gives him a
free will to act in entire [?]
and He makes the spiritual body 
in man strong enough to surmount all
difficulties and to become all mac[?]
of Evil if he so desires it, and thou
Evils you speak of he [?] upon
himself + and upon his race because of
that free will he chooses the wrong
rather than the right.
Were men how to act sufficient[ly]
what a different world would this 
be - Equalize the riches of the Earth
remove poverty and you remove the
greatest cause, the greatest instigator
to [?] - and [?] and want. 
There is enough for all were it shared
alike.
It is Man not God that makes 
one Man ruler of a Kingdom - It is
Man not God that sets a priest[?]
up to represent him and worship

[*158*]

their own Idol, and it is Man 
not GOD that requires blood for 
blood.

Although I pay the greatest deference to your views - yet 
there are points upon which I must beg [a] further 
explanations

[*2374 
8777*] Put to me any question that might 
arise - I feel, I know, that the Mind 
cannot be convinced unless it is 
met with opposition even in the 
slightest source of distrust whatever 
may seem to you or to any one 
the slightest objection to the doctrine 
that I urge - place it before me.

I am aware that GOD in his infinite Power might 
have created & kept man perfectly innocent 
& during his stay on Earth. enjoy a paradise 
and in that Case -

[*2375 
8778 here the response cut my remark short*] And no need of a Soul at all, because 
if you made the Earth their paradise 
or place of perfect happiness, you 
can remove them to none other and 
unless they have a perpetual existence 
and live for Ever they must die out 
as the lowest creature of the Earth 
for their would be no aim in changing 
them from one to another in the 
same state.

I was intending to continue that in that case 
Although there would be no individual merit 
& consequently no reward. There would on the 
other hand be no Eternal punishments

[*2376 
8779*] The Almighty would seem unjust
[?] Original 
[*159*]

to say nothing of Mercy - to His
Creation were it supposed that he
Contemplated for a moment punisht
everlasting - were such the care it wd
be indeed too frightful to contemplate 
the Nature of the Almighty would 
be at once changed - and even the
feelings of a Man must turn with
repugnance from a Being that wd
destroy it - even as a child from
a father whom he knew would be
his Murderer - But when you
know that this short journey thro'
the Earth leads to a life everlasting
[*x*] [?] and the Angelic
loveliness of which is known not
even to the Angels around His throne
when you feel certain that all men
and all things are in a comparatively 
short time to be brought to an End
and that end the beginning of Eternal
bliss that through this short
probation of Earth - the Evil is struggling
with good - Man is tempted only
to overcome - and that the future in
the Eyes of God is all but the present
you at once change the idea that 
He is unjust.

Yet men on this Earth goes thru many Sad
+ sore Trials which to him appear [?]n age
altho' but a Spec in Eternity

2377
8780
The more weary the Pilgrimage the 
brighter the Haven of rest -


160

In your response you say it is Man not God that
requires blood for blood - how can we deter
Men from committing murder.

2378   8781   There are greater punishments than Death
Nothing is more repulsive to Pure
religion - to Him who [practised it]
preached it, than the punishment of
death. - 
     However great the Crime and
the greatest of all is Murder - it can
only be equalled by the Official Murder
that follows.  do to a man what
you will - Imprison him him for life
take from him every freedom of which
he is possessed  but if he has forgotten
that he is human, others are not to
do the same.
     If you confine him only leaving
him the life that he who gives should
alone take. You make him responsible
to GOD. -  for the actions, for the murder
that has deprived him of liberty.-
   But if you take his life what man
can tell at that moment the state
of his Inward Spirit - the hopes that
he has for his soul - It may be that
he dies repentant - and if it be
truly sincere it goes home to its
source - but if he does not do so
if he dies with the Sin on his head 
it falls heavy on the heads of those
who send him to Eternity
     If ought could render his Crime
See previous responses as to the Murderers taking 
by that act the sins of their victims upon their
own Souls - +8783
[*161*]

8781
less in the eyes of His maker, it must
be the knowledge that he was sent 
without the time + the opportunity
for repentance unto His presence and
may he not be forgiven because he
was unable through earthly punishmt
to bring his mind to a [?] state
for asking His forgiveness.
Man knows not what he
does when he destroys life, he cannot
tell the mysteries of that life himself
how much less can he understand
the mighty mysteries of the life
that goes from it.

If he did not hang a murderer = I think a large body
of the people would never believe - that Rich Men
were really punished [?] + we have [?], hung tom
Palmer for poisoning his friend Cooke - tho' there are reasons
to fear he was not the only one attended by him

2379
8782
I know of it - I have seen Palmer
- a very terrible thing worse than
this has happened - So strict a
las should be passed that neither
Rank or Wealth should break thro'
its bounds

But on our tender soliatude for the Souls of Murderers, ought
we not also to remember - the unprepared state in which
the victim is recklessly sent to meet his judge

2380
8783
May we not hope that those who are
hurried into Eternity through the act
of another, go [?] as a child
that the very fact of their so dying
causes their sins to descend upon 
the head of their murderer, leave 
punishment in the hands of God.
162

No man knoweth how he will act.
but because one man commits a 
crime on which the Eye of the
Almighty especially rests other
men are not to go and commit
the same crime  because they
in their blindness have established
it as a law.

Is it not a just retribution [that] when [?]
miscreants like Louis Napoleon - who shot down
hundreds of men & women for his own political
ambition - is "assassinated" as it would be
called by a man who had lost a parent
a brother or a Child in his murderous outrage.

2381  8784   It is not

Are men then to be trampled upon - Men of
science and learning   to be gagged & politically
extingushed by a man supported only by
[the] bayonets [of]

2382   8785    No
doubtless it would be a great
National good if men such as
these were destroyed or cut off at
once - even if it were by the hand
of man.   but provisions are made
for all things and the soldier 
who falls fighting on the battlefield
does not go as it would seem to
some - with his sins upon his head
they are forgiven and he is [un]
unanswerable because the course
of his life has been interfered with
that which might have been has
been prevented.

8 PM. C.A. Mirror

Invoked the CA

The CA is here as usual.

Dr Kenneth R H MacKenzie has favored me this 
Evening with a visit - Agreeable to your kind permiss'in

I beg to ask you some questions on his behalf.

[*8787 2384*] I will answer them

May I ask if you are aware or will kindly enquire 
the name of Mr MacKenzies - Guardian Spirit

[*2385 
8788*] I will enquire when I leave and 
request him to appear.

I presume by your response that you are not aware 
of what order of Spirits he is.

[*2386 
8789*] He is the same Kind of Spirit as Pure 
the Guardian Spirit of Mr Moseley

May I ask of what order or Class of Spirits

[*2387 
8790*] AA

Spirits that may become of the highest 
order - Angels of Hades. - but not 
ministering angels - not of the 
Heavenly Host.

When I. & Mr M. were at Mr Croslands. & Miss A 
was the Seeress - the responses she received were 
given in Various Colors - may I ask if there is 
any occult or Symbolical meaning in relation thereto

[*2388 
8791*] Sometime ago I gave you the meaning 
of Colors as belonging to Spirits

It signifies the importance generally 
of the answers given - you can see 
on referring to what I gave you their 
Significance

I am free to confess I do not remember the Circumstance 
attended to - not having yet indexed my MS's 
I am at a loss to refer to them but will do so

[*2389 
8792*] You enquired as to the Color of the
"It appears I had in my mind confused the colors of the 
answers - with the [?] & ornaments of the Spirits -"

such as - Pansies - blue. & Yellow. in various shades - but no Red. 
Dahlias - Red. & Yellow. - but not blue.
[*164*]

Robes. and also as to the Colors 
that should be used about Crystals 
and Mirrors it was at the same time 
you were preparing the one I now 
appear through.

I think you I now remember it tho indistinctly 
At a sitting at Mr C's - The Spirit Faithful 
was asked the Signce. of the Colors replied

"Every thing seen by the seer is typical of an attribute 
of the Spirit when Manifesting itself - or the feeling 
prompting the Idea" May I ask your View

[*2390 
8793*] It rather signifies the nature and 
Quality of the Spirit itself -

But the same Spirit [not] gave answers in 
different Colors as Gold red, blue, Violet - Amber &c

[*8794 2391*] Not more than two, I think 0

Both Mr M & I were of opinion that some of the 
Spirits had answered in various Colors. but upon 
referring to his MS. notes we found the C.A. was Correct. 
I've mentioned the Circumstance

[*2392 
8795*] You will find on again referring 
that those two Colors harmonize 
are composed of almost the same 
there are none exactly Opposite 
except the Violet and Green - 
Amber Red is near, Blue and Violet

In relation to Colors may I observe there exists a 
Singular Law in the Vegetable Kingdom - [?] that 
no Species of Flowers contain the 3 [Prismatic?] 
Colors Red Yellow & Blue - May I ask if you 
are aware of the fact.

[*2393 
8796*] The Law of Nature gives to each 
Specie a separate Color - the 
Art of Man may mix those 
and produce through Science a 
Mixture of Each
[*165*]

Mr M. wishes to ask if you appeared in his Crystal 
on Odie 13 July - when he was Calling.

[*8797 2394*] I have not done so

May I ask if you know any of the Spirits who 
appear at Mr Croslands & state their names to 
be "Faithful - Integrity - Trust - Firmness 
Comprehensiveness - Devotion - Justice - Nehemiah 
Elevation - Innocence - Activity - Gratitude 
Feeling - Independence - Power - Accumulation 
Courage. - Mystery - Affection - Content 
& The Replenisher"

[*2395 
8798*] These Spirits are all of one Order 
but although they come to Man 
with these significant names it is 
not the one they bear in the Spirit 
World.

They bring it as a motto. they 
make it significant of their Character 
and their desires in Connection with 
those they visit

[*?*] The Dove Angel who has often 
appeared to you as the harbinger 
of Peace in the form of a dove. and 
its purity and its brightness is 
expressive of its Character - it is 
perhaps a pleasing but not a 
powerful way.

Here I made some remark & the CA replied

I would preach of the Mercy 
of GOD and of the dependence of 
Man upon his Mercy and of 
the Necessity of Faith and a 
Reliance on his Mercy - but I do not 
come as the Character of "Mercy."
[*166*]

because I think it more desirable 
higher and holier to come only as a 
Messenger from my own Sphere

The Spirits at Mr C's. on being questioned state 
themselves to be Ministering Angels in various 
Ways. "Faithful" said I am of the order of Intelligences 
sent upon Earth. since the Ascension of our Saviour 
as a comforter unto Man." May I ask if 
that is correct.

[*2396 
8799*] It is correct in the letter but not in 
the Spirit it would lead you to 
believe that he is the Ministering Angel 
from the Throne of Grace to the 
whole race of man whereas he really 
is the Guardian of a Single Man 
and as such only is a Ministering 
Angel

The Spirit "Power" said in his response "I am one of 
the Ministering Spirits sent upon earth to assist in 
warring against the principle miscalled Evil which 
is nothing but the principle of antagonism."

May we ask your view of that reply

[*2397 
8800*] The Antagonistic Power is Evil, such 
as I have mentioned in the work I 
gave you, it can be nothing else 
if it is opposition to [GOD] Good. 
Was not the word Evil misread

I suggested to Dr. M that the words might have 
been "miscalled Devil" & the CA said

[*2398 
8801*] If it is so it is quite right, the 
Vulgar Notion of the Antagonistic 
name is quite wrong

At the same sitting Mr M asked Power if 
"Accumulation" is the name of his GS. in
[*167*]

consequence of his ever striving to add to 
his stock of knowledge - to which "Power" replied 
yes. - Dr M wishes to ask if he is right in 
his Conjecture that these Spirits are of a lower 
order entrusted with the care and development 
of our faculties and the fostering of special 
qualities & tendencies of our nature.

[*2399 
8802*] They are not the highest spirits, but 
they are the Guardians of Men. when 
those men have more than one. -

When they have more than one 
the Guardianship is divided, but 
they are not the sole guardians of 
the lower qualities -

They are guardians of body & Soul 
and he has no other. where there 
is only one guardian they are either 
higher or lower than those Spirits 
more degenerate towards Evil or 
more exalted towards Good.

This morning a little ragged urchin about 10 
or 12 years old picked my pocket - I ran after 
him I took my [Hand?] away from him & let 
him go - did I do right = because if I had 
taken him before a Magistrate it might have been 
the Occasion of his being placed in a reformatory 
& then he might haved tried & tried honestly, as it 
is my [?] may only encourage him in Evil

[*2400 
8803*] Individually you were humane, and 
humanity is right -

You could not have stopped 
the system by punishing one, and 
you perhaps harden him with 
that punishment, for you brand him 
with a name that would unfit him
[*168*] 

for a good position in respectable 
society, and you give him in the 
associates he meets with in his place 
of Confinement instigators to further 
Crime.

Remove the Cause of these things 
and the Consequences will disappear 
It requires Education and punishment 
to make them good.

Torture to the mind is far 
greater than that to the body - it is 
a greater punishment when man acts 
in opposition to moral precept. - to 
the knowledge he has in him of 
right. - it is greater punishment to 
break through the law imposed upon 
himself - than it is to inflict bodily 
punishment - when the Conscience approves 
of it.

"Mystery" proposed to Dr M. at his request to 
discuss passages from Swedenborg with him - 
would you afterwards favor Dr M with your 
views upon the argument.

[*2401 8804*] I will do so

Does the Spirit World recognize a distinction 
between Ministering Angels, and Guardian Spirits?

[*2402 
8805*] They are perfectly distinct although 
one may be a Ministering Spirit and 
a Guardian Angel at the same time.

Guardian Spirits are those 
who come from any Sphere and who 
attach themselves to Individuals upon 
Earth some have them good & bad 
as those qualities predominate in
[*169*]

themselves, some have only 
good and there are cases of those who 
have so lowered themselves as to be 
possessed only of Evil. - and there are 
those who have a Ministering Angel 
for their Guardian. Not perhaps 
because they are better than their 
fellows, but because it is so needed 
that they should change because 
they are desirous of truth. and Truth 
only and yet circumstances rather 
than faults have led them so 
irretrievably into Error. that man & 
all his Arguments. - Spirits with 
all their difference of opinions only 
lead more astray. and it is absolutely 
necessary that if such are brought 
to the right end. - The way and path 
of Truth. It must be by a special 
light - No purpose can be greater 
than guiding such as these to their 
home. And that task devolves in 
the Ministers of Jesus Christ. 
The preachers and the stedfast 
followers of his Word.

May I observe that believing as I do that Good 
Spirits do not, will not rap or move tables - 
I am at a loss to reconcile the fact that the 
Spirits I have named - both rap & also appear 
in the Mirror I lent Mr C. at his house.

[*8806 
2403*] They are not the same who rap 
and appear, you can test them 
I will give you the means of doing 
so before you go there again 
Good and pure Spirits cannot come
Opposition of Crystal & Physical working
170

into so near a contact with matter
as to make themselves felt by
Material bodies , it must be through
the mind the intellect & the reason
alone, that they can Communicate
with man.

Whilst Dr Mackenzie & I were discoursing upon
this subject DM being of opinion from what
had taken place at Mr C's that the same spirits
rapped and appeared  the C A remarked.

2404  8807   The Good is not always so powerful
As the Evil — it has not the same
means of making its power manifest
and the Evil knows the action of
the Good — the Evil might be waiting
in the same room. hearing with
you the responses, and might then
rap at the right time. but this
can be avoided  it must be if you
would progress rightly.
     The two methods of holding
Communication with the spirit world
will never agree they interfere
with each other and one upsets
the other, by asking or allowing
spirits to knock. at the same time
you use the other means of Comm'n
you give the Evil Spirits the opportunity
of working into both. and when
once in they cannot easily be
expelled.

May I ask if you are Aware of Swedenborgs
Doctrine as to the Maximus Homo.

2405   2808   I am aware of his Theory
I have spoken before of his dreams
171

and his visions and I look upon
this as Ideas given to him by spirits
which he worked into Theories, wrongly
it has no foundation

May I ask. When it will be agreeable for you to
Continue Your remarks upon the Apocalypse.

2406   8809   Tuesday week I will answer them

If my advice &c

2407   8810   It would be best for Mr  M. to have a
Mirror the same in form as the one
you gave Mr Burton.

do you mean a Silvered Mirror is a black Mirror

2408  8811  A Black Mirror

Will you be kind enough o request & Mr M's
Guardian Spirit to appear

2409   8812   I will

1/4 past 9 PM    The C. A. left

                               Invoked Mr M's GS.
In about two minutes the Mirror veiled & [?]
& Emma said   It's very small, yet very plain
and distinct — no wings light hair. the hair
is bound up and does not hang in Curls
it has a Silvery robe like very then tissue,
which gets Shadowy as it descends towards
the feet. — theres a fastening in front something
flat.— The dress is in large folds
May I ask your name

8813   COURAGE

Are you the GS of Mr M.

8814   I am

Of what order
Now there's an amber Stone in front & two AA
Now its gone the fold fo the dress has gone over it
[*172*]

how long have you been his GS.

[*8815*] 23 years

What are your offices & duties towards him as 
his GS.

[*8816*] I have power to influence & direct his mind

If that is so you possess the power of annulling 
Man's noblest gift. his Freewill.

[*8817*] I do not 
I only use that power to guide him 
towards good 
And although a Power it is limited

Can you convey to our Mortal Ideas how a man 
is thus guided by his GS.

[*8818*] I impel him to exertion, give him 
the desire for investigating, and the 
Power of perseverance in his mortal 
Studies

Are you aware of that class of Spirits called 
Atmospheric Spirits -- Spirits who are the double 
or other Self of us Mortals

[*8819*] Of course I am no Spirits can enter 
the Earth without passing thro' it 
It is the Mirror of the Earth and 
the Keeper of Mans Actions.

Then you know Mr M's Atmospheric Spirit

[*8820*] Yes

Do you act upon Mr M thro' his A.S.

[*8821*] No 
They do it by direct influence, nothing 
separates them. nothing interferes 
with them.

do you know or believe that Mans past actions 
can be brought & rendered Visible to the Eyes 
of a Seer in our Magic Mirrors & Crystals

[*8822*] They can be brought from the place of
[*173*]

record where they [are kept] exist 
to the Eye, if the proper means be used

Dr M Will you inform me what at Mr C's "Mystery" 
appears as my Guardian Spirit and here 
you appear.

[*8823*] You have another - you have three 
Guardian Spirits

Will you tell me their names

[*8824*] Do you mean the names they bear 
in the Spirit World

Yes if you please

[*8825*] One accumulates Knowledge of Mystery 
of Science and the other with courage 
drives away the obstacles and 
makes the Mystery dissolve.

Why has Mr M three Guardian Spirits whilst 
I have only one.

[*8826*] They are of a different class 
Yours may be more strictly termed 
Guardian of the Soul. - his are as 
well of the body as of the Soul.

I ex. very strongly and asked if Courage 
rapped or moved the Table at Mr C's when 
Mr M. was last there

[*8827*] I would rather not be questioned

I ex. & again asked

[*8828*] I did not.

Do you approve of my making Mr M. a Mirror

[*8829*] Yes I do

Will you or one of his other GS. become guardian 
of the Mirror to prevent Evil Spirits appearing

[*8830*] All three

Have you any Instructions to give [?] it 
shall I line with black [?] or Velvet

[*8831*] black Silk.
[*174*]

[*8832*] I would rather not be in any way 
connected with rapping Spirits 
I would rather not that the Mirror 
should be connect with rapping Spirits 
I have not the power to act in 
Opposition to them - sufficient to keep 
them away if you desired that they 
should be present. 
I would rather that the Commn. 
with the Spirit World should [be] at 
least be kept separate.

Will Mr M be able to develop his faculty of 
Seeing - which he is said to possess

[*8833*] he will

In how long a time

[*8834*] It seems to me longer than it did 
once - but it is in a fair way of 
being developed

Are you are of the existence of the Spirit "Orion"

[*8835*] Yes 
He is a very good Spirit, no harm can 
arise from his being called he possesses 
a great deal of information & would 
willingly give it to others.

I exd. by the name. I asked if he was truly of that 
opinion

[*8836*] he seems to be so 
I believe that he has been inferior

I sued the [St.?] Ex. and Od. Are you not aware that he 
is an Evil disposed Wandering Spirit

[*8837*] No 
His appearance is changed, he no 
longer wears armour, and he dwells 
in a higher Sphere

May I ask if the C.A directed a black mirror
[*175*]

to be made - for the purpose of better developing 
Mr. M's sight

[*8838*] It is. - It requires a much stronger 
Vision when the mirror is plated

Shall I use the plate I have upstairs.

[*8839 Yes

Dr M Am I right in the path I am pursuing in 
developing Spiritualism in the way that I am

[*8840*] You are. If you will cease to make 
use of Rapping as an Agent for 
Communion.

Dr M If I undertake to abstain from all Communicatns. 
with rapping Spirits, will you develop my sight 
sooner.

[*8841*] I cannot do it more speedily but 
when obtained it will be better.

Dr M. Will you ask Mystery my other GS to appear

[*8842*] he cannot appear this Evening. 
he will do so another Evening if 
requested

on what days shall I use the Mirror 

[*8843*] Tuesdays in the Evening

Am I to be limited to that day

[*8844*] I cannot tell

If any advice &c

[*8845*] I have not.

hes gone 10. PM.

[*to this*]

[?25] Aug. 1856
C. A Mirror
Invoked the CA.
8 PM-
The C A is here as usual.
Will it be agreeable for us to see Mr Anderson.
8846
2410
It will
After I have been favored with your views upon the
Apocalypse will you inform me when MohamEd
Ali will givE me an explanation of the Nineveh
Inscriptions
8847
2411
I cannot tell on what day he will appear
Are there any Spirits who can givE information or
have a knowledge of Subjects that would elucidate
the Early history of Man.
2412
8848
There are those who have visited earth
from its beginning , but they have visited
it as Spirits and their knowledge of
the Material is limited
You mentioned in a former response (No 8782) that
you had seen Palmer — may I ask what was his
State when you so saw him
2413
8849
he was in the Atmosphere in the same
State as when he left the Earth.—
he is there now and will remain so for a long time.
8850
does he in that State Confess his Crimes
2414 Yes
Was it here that he also Murdered his Brother &
Wife
8857
2415
It was
You at the same time said "that worse than than
and since happened. — to what did you allude
8852
2415
the Bloodshed in Spain
If not the present Convulsed State of the whole
world a forEshadowing of the Wars [?] of
177
Wars preceding the promised Millenium
8853
2417
It is so
May I now ask if Jesus in addressing the Jews to
whom his mission appeared limited spoke according
to his knowledge fo the Jewish scriptures acquired in his humanity
2418
8854
From his human knowledge fo their Prophecy.
In quoting the Scripture of the Jews the old Testt.
did Jesus appeal to them from his own belief
in their divine inspiration — or as appealing to
the belief of the Jews in their divine Origin — no a
 proof of his mission.
2418
8855
He knew that they were not divinEly
inspired
he spoke of them to the Jews because
he knew that they had faith in them
and he knew that they were the true
predictions of his Coming
A man may prophecy truly and
yet be not inspired — or much Evil and
some good may be givEn in his prophecies
May I ask why Jesus ' own mission appears to
have been solely to the Jews.— and the Conversion
of the Gentiles left to the Apostles & disciples
2420
8856
He was born of the Jews and he preached
amongst his race. He knew that his
words would go forth. to the other
inhabitants of the Globe in after yeras
and he also knew that the Jews needed
more strengthening for they would be more
Persecuted.
Yet his preaching and actions Converted but a
small portion of the Jews, & they exist now as a
race scattered over a large portion of the Globe
in the midst of Christians — yet unconverted.
[*178*]

[*2421 
8857*] Because they are strongest in 
their opposing faith, they need greater 
exertion and counsel to bring them to a 
belief in Christ

He made that exertion for them 
when he was upon Earth, and he would 
have all men professing themselves 
Christians, Christians at heart and in 
actions to look to their spiritual 
welfare

Do you think that they will as a Nation be 
restored to Jerusalem & Palestine - it is a favorite 
Theory of the Apocalyptic Writers.

[*8858 2422*] No I do not.

It is now nearly two years since I have used 
my [Exam?] Glass - in consequence of Mr Dressers 
At Spirit being limited to it - do you thin I 
may now use it with safety

[*8859 2423*] You can if he is not present

As I am afraid I must appear to him to have 
behaved rudely. I should much like to give him 
another Evenings Seance

[*2424 
8860*] There is no objection to his Coming on a 
Tuesday Evening if you do not use 
any but the Mirror which I now 
am in.

I will then do so, as I should be sorry for him 
to think I had behaved ill

[*2425 
8861*] Do so I have the greatest objection to 
any apparent want of courtesy - which 
it must seem to him although it 
could not be avoided if you wished 
to obtain harmony in your Communion 
with Spirits

As I have lent Mr Crosland my Oval Mirror 
can I call Mr Anderson in this
                                                             179
2426 He will appear in the box [?]
do you mean the brain [?]
8861  2427 Yes
Should we be able to share [?] in that
you [?]
2428 [?] [?] [?] you can then
8863 Ask him if he has any objection [?]
[?] [?] he should do in this if he has 
none I have none.
Is this I [?] the [?] than I the one [?] [?]
8864   2429 this the same.
I [?] then call him into if 
8865  2430 do so.
If my [?]
8866   2431 [?] not
[?]


180
New Mirror and Your GS. Constantine
8869
You may as well call me in the other.
You can [there] see more readings I will then
tell you
5 to 9.
C A Mirror
Called Mr Anderson
Now hes walked in — but his coat is buttoned up 
Close.
8870
I am in Spain now , at home, I have
been extremely fortunate with my mirror
since I saw you last.
I now practice it systematically and
find that without any inconvenience or
trouble. I receive bettor Communications
taht are really more desirable — than
spiritual credence given as it was before
at all times and in all places now.
that I use the Mirror I find that I
am limited to it — Confined to that
means alone , and I do not desire
that it should be otherwise.
I am pleased to hear that because I had a finger
in the pie.—
8871
I thank you for your kind exertions
and I am quite satisfied that you will
feel well paid in knowing that anyone
had received benefit from them.
I was extremely sorry to hear that
you had been deprived for a time of
Your blessing—but as it has returned
at last. it was but a small Evil.
Is Constantine Your GS. now
8872 he is.
What is Your opinion of O'donnell—&the Amiable
Isabella. do you think they will Succeed in
181
their murderous villaines

8873
His party will remain the strongest no
doubt for some time - but I have no
doubt there will be another insurrection
it is a terrible thing, but I take no
part in the fight -

Shall you return soon.

8874  O yes I am only absent on leave.

have you any thing [A????s] in Spiritual
Matters to Communicate to me. Since we last
met.

8875
I have received nothing but some religious
discourse - a spirit or two that
Constantine has desired to appear.
and a few Atmospheric Spirits of
Friends.
Have you ever seen LITESMO.
in either of your mirrors or Crystals
or received his name from any other

No - To what order does he belong

8876
AIA
That is the highest is it not
I wish you would call him at your
convenience.

I will do so if the CA will give me leave

8877
You can enquire about him first &
I think you would find him very
pleasing and instructive - he has
appeared to me
I have the name of another, I think
a new one too.

Will you tell me that name

8878
I forget how its spelt if you will
wait one moment -

Now Mr A's gone. (2') Now hes come back & said
182

8879   I have the names of all the Spirits
I believe I have not omitted one
Since I began these Studies, the 
one I was speaking of has a strange
name SEVENHOMINA

It is a long name  do you know the meaning of 
"Seven - homina - "

8880   They told me it was not pronounced
liked that as you spoke it.
it is Seven - o - mina

I read it so

8881  That's right

Of what class is he.

8882  I remarked on the name being curious
when I was told so expressly the
way of pronouncing it.  and he
said it was "Angels - Stars"  and
that he was of the A A order and
no I (capital i) over.

did you call him

8883   No Constantine -- at least not before
Constantine had mentioned that his
communications were truthful and
good  and that he recommended
Me to commune with him, as one --
"Knowing much, and fearing GOD"
I invoked him after that -- whether
his title "Angels - Stars" is the same
as that of the C A.  or whether he 
has any thing to do [what] with the
Celestial bodies, I dont know

I have kept the whole of my responses as well
as names -- since I have had my present Seer

8884   So have I as near as I can but the
names I have on a separate list
by way of reference.  please to remember


8887    this is our respective "doubles"
183

that I have to do it all

I mentioned my seance at Mr Croslands & the
Names of the Spirits there - have you had any
such spirits

8885
I have not, and did not know
that any such existed

Selina is looking in the Erani Glass to try & see some
one. but her vision does not improve much

8886
I don't think she tries often enough
I have seen you several times since
I appeared last.

I hope I behaved properly

8887
You did - I am very pleased that both
your own and my manners have greatly
improved.

do you remember your Promise about the Lady.
you were going to Court.

8888
Oh yes I did go and quite made up
my mind to marry a small fortune
but when I found out there was a very
large appendage - a widow of 40 and
three children I returned to Cheltenham
much the same as I went.

how is our friend Mrs. Powell and her Son who is
"so like his father"

8889
I believe they are quite well, dont you
recollect the boy was to have appeared
a time or two ago.

Yes but he never did appear

8890
he would do so he is at Cheltenham now.
I had a letter from them a day or
two ago - (Selina here laughed) -
O you might see it Miss it was only
about Mrs. Powells 100 a year that he
left me in Charge of
184
Is Miss Pengina married yet
8891
No she is not.
(I remarked to Selina how sleepy I feel ) & Mr A said
8892
I am afraid you dont have sleep
enough at night — too bad to go to bed
so late and rise so early.
You remark jut now about your "Atmospheric
friends" sounds [d??ll] when you are only the
Atmospheric double — yourself.
8893
but I speak of the body and I personify
that. it was in the body that I [[?]] received
the visions — of all the things I hav
mentioned or rather of all the spirits
for I have had no scenEs or Events [?]
some time past.
Can you or your Atmospheric Spirit tell me how
You bring into the mirror — your room. pictures
Furniture &c as you have done
8894
I do not know
I am not the only one that appears so
All do it occasionally
but I thought in Your At State you would
know the Modus operandi
8895
I know no more than you know how
you appear in mine in the same way.
but you have often Appeared to us to walk on
if the Crystal and fetch other persons in whom
I have wished to see.
8896
a spirit of the Mirror could show him
in Company with me — at least the
Spirit of the Crystal has done it, I dont
know how it might be now.
but you have often left the Crystal. & then walked
in Arrm in Arm — that was your doing, not the
Spirit of the Crystals'
8897
I left the Crystal, & found him brought
185
there by the Spirit of the Crystal
because you desired it and ready to associate
with me.

Is that how you used to bring in Miss Green & her
Nieces

8898
I brought them the same as I Do the tables
chairs &c I suppose - because I was
associated with them in life

Are either of the Miss Greens married yet

8899
There was only one Miss Green. the old
Lady - The Nieces are both married

When do you think of being in London

8900  The latter part of September.

because we intend shortly going to the Theatre
& I hope this time the recognition will be mutual

8901
I am not going to be served the same
as I was last time

This time we will keep our Promise

8902  We'll see

Have You received any historical information

8903  Not lately.

I often wonder whether your Singular Experiment
with the Spirit who escaped from the bottle in
your Atmosphere is in the body

8904
Bodily upon Earth
I assure you I dont want it to happen
again.

Do you ever try the [Palingenesia?] now

8905  No I do not.

It is a pity these experiments can only be done
by Evil Spirits they could be so Convincing to others

8906
They are of course more Convincing because
Every one can witness them. but they are
[Especally?] for the body.
Communications coming a different way
or from higher Sources are professedly for
the Soul

[*186*] 

have you anything interesting in our Spiritual 
way you would like to Communicate

[*8907*] I have nothing this Evening, but I will 
appear again on another Evening. 
I will wish you good night then

Good night

C A Mirror

1/4 before 8. Invoked the C.A.

The CA is here in White Purple Robe as Usual.

May I this Evening be favored with the Continuation 
of your views on the Apocalypse

[*8908 2432*] Yes

Shall I read the whole or half of the Chapter

[*8909 2433*] Read the whole of the 11th.

I read Revn. Chapt. 11.

[*2434 
8910*] That is part vision & part prophecy 
it cannot be received in a literal sense 

It is wrong to suppose that things 
such as he describes will really take 
place at the last day.

The divining rods he mentions were 
those belonging to himself - by which he 
exercised power over Earthly & Spiritual 
things.

May I ask if you have any further remarks to 
make on that Chapter

[*2435 
8911*] Not unless you have any Questions to 
ask concerning it.

I read Chapter 12.

[*2436 
8912*] But one does not refer to the end of 
the world at all - it is symbolical 
of the beginning of Christianity.
187
The Spirit of GOD coming from
Earth — struggles through the EArhtly
nature to overcome the spirit of Evil
hence arises a warfare between the
flesh and what is there termed the
Devil — it may be applied to the whole
of the time that the Eartha dn man
exists in its present state , but it is
useless when the [?] is gone
or even going — for then the struggle
will be over.
I read Revelations Ch. 13
2437
8913
It was intended for the Present time
it can I think only be applied to the
powers of the mighty Antagonist
before the close of his Spiritual exisrence
— before the Millenium—
The last struggles fo the Enemy
of Man for the possession of GOD's
creation was well known even at
that early age to those who could make
use of a Power not now so generally
used as that of divining and Spirit
seeing. he seems to have taken
particular notice (for he describes them
well ) of Evil Spirits that arose from
the waters to the Earth. Their appearnce
to the Eyes of a Mortal is as he describes
those who have the Power can see
them. — their Actions can be known
by the struggles about to take place
throughout the world even to those
who have no spiritual sight.

The Anti Christ is the Chief of the

Emanation of the Divinity upon earth

his mercy to him , so also the Prince
of Evil sends an Emanation from his body

I read Rev. Ch. 14.

2439   8915   There you have a picture of the end 
of the world. in the mortal world as
it is in the spiritual.— it is the same
as spoken of by Christ in his Parables
I cannot see the use of such language
When you think that all things will be

will be seen  that there will be no
mortal sight even — that even the
Angels will be shapeless. — and Mount
Zion crumbled away and gone.
that the bodies of those existing in
Earth will be changed in the twinkling

that such as John describes can be

may there be learned from them

to the punishment of GOD inflicted

Evil spirit — was felt by Man. and
that she will ever remain his greatest
organ for tempting man into Sin.

how great has been her Sins

I read Rev xx

2445

He is quite wrong in his doctrine of
two resurrections - the final destruction
of Evil does not take place until the
resurrection of the whole human race
The Almighty does not triumph
over all things and proclaim
himself the same as at the beginning
the only existing perfect power
until he has received those in
purity equal to the blessed, who have
sinned and received punishment -

read Rev xxi

2446
8922
The place there described to meet
the imagination of Man by all 
that seems to him of the rarest
beauty, is in its peculiar way a
correct description of the heaven
prepared for the reception of Mens
Souls. Well termed by John
the Bride of the Man - for that
must indeed be the beloved of Christ
for which he could suffer + die
upon the Cross.

read Rev. xxii

2447
8923

alter his works with his curse - with
the desire that they may receive
not the blessings of God - he shows

8 PM
In continuing the subject of the Apocalypse may I
ask how John - one of the disciples of our Lord
[came] [to] [be] was permitted to write this book which
Emanating from him - Forming in after times a
portion of the New Testament is deemed by a vast 
majority of the Christian world of "divine inspiration - 

2457
8927
Although I have said the writings of
John are unnecessary to the Spiritual
Welfare of Men's Souls - that they are 
superfluous to the book to which they are not
written in a language that should have
been used to give a clear + definite idea
Thousands of [?] and the [?] of this life as rewarded by the
disciples--the only [?]--
"Religion" That which [?] the spirit of man nearest
to his God--
194
of the extraordinary dreams & visions
of the writer—Yet there is nothing in
them that can do harm — There is nothing 
but what divested of its imaginary clothing
and brought down to the level of mans 
comprehension and common sense can
be reconciled with the Truth as written
by the Divine inspiration in the lives
of Jesus Christ by his immediate Disciples
     The only essentially necessary part
of the Bible contained in the New Testament
are the words of Jesus Christ & the actions
of his life as recorded by his disciples
They are Truthful and Consistent and
they unaided from the basis of religion 
— When I say religion I mean strictly
speaking - that which Elevates the spirit
of man nearest to his GOD.

May I observe that the majority of Christians, deemi[ng]
the book "divinely inspired" [consider it] & consequently
a Prophecy . of Events that have or will actually
take place — some symbolicaly others absolutely
literal —

2452
8928  Such things will never really be seen
If you divest these prophecies from the
power which they have through being
attached to the Divine Inspiration — if you
separate them from the scriptures and
look upon them merely as the dreams
& visions of a man even like [?]
No value — not Even sense can be found
in the likeness and the figures that are
made by John the inhabitants of
heaven and the workers upon Earth
it is impossible to suppose that the
105
wrath of [God] the Almighty can
be as it were "bottled" that when HeavEn
and earth has passed away and all
things material have gone back to their
source — that such materiality can
exist as the things , that he mentions from
whence the purest of all spirits emanate
from taht place where Man with a
particlE of his material body. where even
the mind whilst inhabiting [?]
clinging to that material body cannot
approach or Even understand.— And if
man with his body endowEd with the
likeness of [his] GOD — of all his Creation
the nearest to his maker. cnnot
approach His presence unless he be
divested of every thing Appertaining to
the flesh. and the Earth. — how is it
possible — how can the reason of man
make it possible for things which
are created for his most servile use
made for him to govern & Command
and kill at his pleasure. be found with
their shape and their body in that
place where he is unfit to approach
At my former Sitting I unfortunately omitted
reading the 18 Chapter may I read it now
that I may to have any hiatus in your remarks
8929
2453
Read it
read Rev XVIII
2454

I believe that England is the place
meant for destruction — that such
Was his prophecy of the things that
will take place it may be destroyed
suddenly, but not until it is no
196
no longer useful — not until it
has givEn up to GOD its precious
freight of human souls.—
Although the Land , for such
a little spot — of the greatest wealth
it has the greatest misery , and altho
the Land of the greatest sin , for it has
the greatest enlightenment — there are
many in it of the True Faith. and
for the sake of the few shall the many
be saved from destruction.
Your remarks are singularly opposed to the views
of the Reverend [exp???d?s] of this look - they
Are almost unanimous in considering England as
"the blessed Land" & pour out the whole of their
Religious hatred, and holy wrath upon the Pope
& especially Rome & the other to Catholic Kingdoms
2455
8931
But Rome is not a City of Merchants
Rome is not walled with Strips or
depending upon merchandize for
such a fast amount of wealth as
England.
I read Rev XVII v 5.
May I observe that EvEn the [?] of the [D???]
Mole — [?] in their Gloss = "A Mystery" that is a secret
because what follows of the Title and the great harlot
is to e taken in a mystical sense — [?] ["Babylon"]
"Babylon" Either the City of the Devil in General, or
of this place be to be understood [literally] of any particular
City, Pagan Rome which then & for 301 Years [and]
persecuted the church ; and was the principal sent
both of Empire and idolatory—
2456
8932
But the things prophecied have not yet
taken place — therefore it must allude to
something yet to come . and I believe
with all others of my Class that the

197

special city pointed to is London.   
that the time is not yet arrived for the
fulfilment of these things, that when
they do come to pass - that it will not be
as he understood - that his words are [not]
only [mystical] symbolical even of the
destruction

Will you allow me to ask your view of some
portion of the Commentaries of the Douay bible.

2457   8933   I will answer them

I read from Ch. 1 v 1.  and also VI v  2.         see note -a-

2458   8734   That is right but it is John that makes 
these verses ?  symbolical of the destruction

read  Gloss  IX v 1 .      note B,

2459   8935    The commentator speaks much of
 -- The Church -- and seems to consider
it the greatest sin & deserving of the
greatest punishment  for either the
members of the Church.  to him from it
and against it -- or for others not of the
Church to rise in opposition against
it & try to overthrow it -- now by persons
of different Faith, Protestant  & Catholic
both talking of the "the Church" how is it
to be understood   my knowledge of [the]
-- the Church" is different from theirs

May I solicit your view of "The Church"

2460   8936    That Church of which Christ is the 
head and the Corner stone is in the
hearts of those who have faith!
     Faith to a different extent among
the members of every different Religion
of every different persuasion -- of every
different sect -- may exist in the protestant
may exist in the deist it may exist
198

8936
in the worshippers of Idols — In
those who have never seen or heard
because Circumstances have prevented it —
if the Gospel is Christianity —
     Where the heart is human, there
may faith exist — of course in different
desires according to the enlightenment 
of the possessor
     That faith I believe to be, the
belief and the knowledge that passeth
all understanding of a being infinitely
Greater, and finer, and mightier[s]
than man.., existing in unison with
the best feelings , the purest sentiments
of mans Nature . And that can be
approached and pleased and whose
Grace can alone be obtained through
meritorious actions —
     And I also most firmly believe
that this faith, goes home to its
Source. and  that where this faith
is — there also is the spirit of God
the Holy Ghost.
     And where a GOD is recognized
And a son is unknown that son is
one in influence with the Father. and
he intercedes for the one who worships
the Father alone as much as though
he knew him — and recognized him as
Saviour.—
     But to have the Knowledge of
Jesus Christ and not to believe in him
to receive him only with doubt & uncertainty
is to want Faith — and the want
of that Faith may be found in any
199

Church amongst the strictest 
followers of any form of religion
     You have read the Revelations of 
St John and the remarks upon it 
by other Men. - in reading it through 
what opinion have you formed - 
what had you formed upon it before 
you read it to me.

2461   8937   Your opinion is right, It is an 
exaggeration & yet a prophecy.

I read Gloss IX.3

2462   8938   And I look upon the Locusts as Evil 
Spirits - in the form of Spirits never 
seen bodily - the word Locusts is used 
only to signify torments.

Read Gloss XII.I and XIII.I.

2463   8939    The Commentators on the Revelations seem 
to think - that him they call the Anti-
-Christ shall be at the head of a 
Kingdom one of the rulers of the Earth 
must probably born a King, a King thro'
200
the accident of Birth, not through
his own powers [and will] it will not be
so the means by which the power of
Evil shall at last resort to overcome good
and by which the last struggle shall
take place will not be a monarch, or a
Governor of people.

May I resume this subject next Tuesday Evening

[*8940*]
2464  Yes

I received this letter from Robert Owen. - have I your
permission to send for his perusal your work on 
Metaphysics

[*8941*]
2465  You have.

Mr. JGH. Brown of Nortingham lately Published
several small pamphlets on Crystal work & the
Revelations he has received may I read an extract

[*8942*]
2466  do so

Read. - Chap. 16. "Celestial revelation on the Progress and
and occupation of the Spirits through the Seven Angelic
Aerial orders of the planets - page 94. Part 4.

[*8943*]
2467  It is very good
The Spirit is correct although the Language
sometime differs

Mr. Capron in his work on Modern Spiritualism has
given the following inscriptions on Spiritual writing
performed by Spirits in 1851 at the House of the Revd
Dr Phelps - and as the Characters greatly resemble those
on the work of "Rabbi Solomon" "Solomon the King"
& other Cabalitic Mfs. may I ask their meaning

[*8944*]
2468  It is Spiritual language

Will you favor me with a Translation, or the ideas
intended to be Conveyed.

2469
8945
They are not intended to be conveyed - No Man.
can read Spiritual language, they cannot
be embodied in his Ideas.
It is given by them as a talisman of
201

Power - as a Seal, not as a means
of conveying Sentiments or Opinions

do they emanate from Good Spirits

2470   8946   No from those that rap.

I mentioned the Translations given by persons when
in a Mesmeric Clairvoyant State

2471    8947    I think I have before told you that when
in the Clairvoyant State, the Spirit speaks
through the body of the medium, how easy
it is then to make men believe that even
these figures may be but a copy of the
bible in peculiar Characters.

I then read the Translations which were given by
two Clairvoyants - & were utterly [opposed] different

2472    8748    Were 6 Clairvoyants Chosen in different
Places - six different meanings would
be given because each Spirit would have
his own design.

7 [?] 45 PM
Invoked the CA
May I submit to your notice the following Commentaries upon
[?] of the Revelations as givEn by the Roman Catholics
in the [?] Translation, their [?] affords a
Remarkable Contrast to the Pious [?] which distinguishes
the Protestant writers upon this subject both High
Church and Evangelical
2475
8957
Yes
I read the Gloss — upon Rev. II 26 [?]
2476
8952
It shows a moderate and mild understg.
of the language expressed in those verses
I believe that John meant Angels
when he said Saints for I know taht
none save Christ who have ever dwelt
upon Earth can intercede for man or
receivE his Prayers.
May I observe in a former response — you stated
that the Virgin Mary was an intercessor for those
who believed in her.
2477
8953
I did
She has power and influence
When I spoke now I omitted to mention
her I was answering the Catholics view
of their being patron Saints. taht is
men who have tried greater than their
fellows. and through their holiness and
Piety receivEd as a recompense power
over those still remaining
In this light the Virgin Mary
is not one of them — She is not in her
present high position as a reward for
individual merit on Earth for no
particular piety a great worth individually
203

is she made blessed for from her 
being the instrument and by the almighty
to give to the world its Saviour & Redeemer

You are right

Read XXII  v. 10 and the Gloss.

2478   8954   I believe that but very few of the things
mentioned by John have taken place
That they are pictures of spiritual things
which shall take place at the end of
the World  Allegorically made human
better to [?] in his idea the Comprehension
of [Man] those who should follow in
after years -- I believe him to have
been greatly mistaken --
     had his language been less exaggerated
by Symbols it would have appeared
more truthful.


2479   8955   If you wish to read them I will give you
my opinions

I thank you  I will with your kind permission
read an analysis of the Writings of Joseph Mede
who stands at the head of the English Commentators
as given by the Rev'd Alfred Jenner in his Rationale
Apocalypticism pages 401 to 408. & his remarks
thereon.
I read it --

2480   8956   A Man of deep thought may with
careful attention bring many of the
204
Prophecies of St. John to meet the
transactions of the world in all ages.
but if the fulfillment of these prophecies
is so indefinite as only to be bared by one
out of many after deep research of what
use can they be to the multitude who lead
the revelations.
8956
I neither agree with the Comments You
have read of St Johns writing, or of those
made upon the writers ([?]) writings, for
I think that when those things prophecied
come to be fulfilled , unmistakeable
Evidence will be givEn to all readers , they
will be able to know at once rom their
similarity when each Event has happEned
and I feel certain in opposition to all
of them that the destruction of England
and Especially London is meant by
Babylon.
I read the whole of [?] Synopsis of Flemings
discourse of the Rise & fall of Papacy. p 408 to 414
2481
8957
It seems to me strange that they
should look upon the Pope of rome
as being such Authority and of being
so important a personage in the
fulfillment of these things.
surely it is but the hatred of
one religion for another — if he is one
of the greatest potentates upon 
Earth. he
is mde so by his people not elected by
GOD. — If he makes the minds of so
many men subservient to his will, it is
through their own belief in his infallibility
in the sight of GOD he is no higher
no better, no more worthy of filling
2481
the Station that he holds than one of the
lowest of those who elect him — if the is no
greater than these neither is he any worse
than those of different religions who would
persecute him because of his position
I read the Analysis of [Bos?ne?] Bishop. of [Mea?x]
Commentary upon the Revelations pub in 1690. [?] 411
to page 414. — and remarked upon the Reviewers objections
2482
Each of the three that you have read differ
in their opinions because each makes it
the weapon for denouncing the meter of
a different faith
I believe neither to be right in their
Assuming the prophecies to be fulfilled
in the facts that they mention , but I
think the last one is milder than the
first in the doctrine that pervades his
comments.
I thank you I have read the 3 Chief writes opinions
& the multitude of [?] upon the Subject altho
following some what in their footsteps — all differ
more or less from Each other . The last [?] of any
note is Dr [?], but his works are are mere scissors
& paste. & Evidently written for the Almighty dollar—
may I ask if you havE any further Comments
upon the subject.
2483
I do not see in the revelation of Fr John
sufficient importance to call the attention
and thought and care bestowEd upon
them by so many learned writers
Their love of solving a mystery and of
making the incomprehensible — clear — may perhaps
account for their bestowing the powers of
205
mind upon that which is by no means
Stamped with important truth and
must unwillingly believe that men
pretending to a divine calling of whatever
denomination use their learning in
Elucidating these visions more as a weapon
to inflict punishment and to retaliate
upon others of a different Creed, by presuming
them to be the objects of wrath rather
than by Showing out more plainly what
is really the moral of the work runing
through its whole course.
May I ask if you have Ever turned Your attention
to the Prophecies of Ezekiel & Daniel
2484
8958
I have , I do not look upon them
as inspired, but still believe that
their prophecies in some things may be
fulfilled.
As I havE desired so much pleasure & instruction
from your responses I also from Your Work in Spiritual
Philosophy — I hope I am not trespassing too much

In No. long last "Saturday's Review" a scurrilous

Good Evening Mr. Anderson I hope you are well
8963
quite 
well thank you
I have been looking in my mirror
this EvEning — I have been watching
You — a gentleman came in with
You who I believe from what eh said to be himself a Seer. whether
you know such a one is of course
unknown to me but he seems to have
been making pretty free with your
name and I should think of your
Crystal and the form that you have
givEn him — and a person with
whom he is acquainted seems to have
bad influences about him. although
belonging to the Church. perhaps you
will enquire into it—
What was his personal Appearance did he givE his name
8966
He was much shorter than you are
and dark — the other who appeared
with him was tall pale & fair.
I explained my Acquaintance with Mr Kenneth
Mackenzie —[?] him my Crystal.—
8967
Men do not be acuqinaten iwht his
friend you may depend there is
some Evil attached to him.
I thank you, have you seen last weeks Saturday
Reviews
8968
I have not it was only this EvEning
I have had this vision—
The Clergyman seemed to be
endeavoring to press between this
Gentleman and yourself, and behind
him and on both sides encircling
208
him like a stream continually
running onwards were minute deformities
I suppose spirits of all imaginable
shapes. — all in different attitudes,
some dancing , others apparently
playing instruments. Some gesticulating
violently and others carring forks |?|
and bundles . and military things
that are used by us.

I mentioned the heads of the article & also the
origin of my name having appeared in the book
reviewed.

8969
It makes Your higher Communication
lose their value of course , when
jumbled together with such absurdities
which they sem to consider , because
mysterious — all Spiritual —
     I have now great faith in the
Communications given me by the
Mirror — after you had left the
Spirit whose name I have given
you.  Seven-ho-mina and said that
in relation to this — that any
clergyman is in his words, that
any professor of religion should be
avoided in mans working with
spiritual agency.  as professors of
religion —
     That men holding communion
with spirits must divest themselves
of all authority — that the Trial of
Spirits by the test of their own goodness
would ensure failure — he said that
he would advise you not to receive
with friendship this professor of
religion — because as such he was
deceitful — and as a man under Evil
influence.
You will not of Course let what
209
I have told you go further to reach
either him or the Gentleman that was
with him -
I give it you that you alone
may take caution and enquire
further. before an introduction ripens
into intimacy.

Shall I read Mr. M's letter

8970  Do

I read the letter. And asked if I had made myself
understood

8971
You have thank you - 
It seems to have been an excellent
Vision for the first one, and his
faculty much [easilier?] developed
than any I have before heard of.

His Mother appears to have the faculty undevelopd
Perhaps it is hereditary

8972  very likely

I mentioned the tenor of the C.A's remarks on
the Apocalypse & Apocalyptic writers.

8973 
I still have a lingering affection
for a religion which seems to me
purer than any other. I mean when
taken alone without its attendant
priesthood.

Yes Christianity without a priesthood is doubtless
the True Religion

8974
But I mean the Roman Catholic View
of Christianity rather than the
Protestant -

But I cannot accept the Doctrine of the Real
Presence in the Eucharist

8975  That is a mystery.

I have this Evening been promised a Continuation
of the C A's work on Metaphysics

8976
That will be indeed interesting
I should like when convenient to

210

You to have the CA's opinion on
the Sacrament.
I think as Miracles have been
and still are performed it is no
greater one and quite as possible
that the wine in its consecration
should become blood and the bread
have the properties of flesh - than
that actual living blood should flow
from the wound in the Consecrated
likeness of the Savior -

I agree with you - and when I believe the one
I can have no difficulty in believing the other.
but if let me ask. - The miraculous Transformation
to his plan or not. - when eaten what becomes of 
it?.

8977
That the life from this blood & 
meat diffuses itself through the
human body. and makes us one
with the body of Christ in Union

But this can only take effect through faith, besides
it would require daily myriads of continual
miracles

8978
Yes but we suppose that the Miracle
that transforms the bread and wine
continues to abide by it - and that
different from the food received
for nature. retains its properties
as long as life and faith lasts.
I am not decided about if I
only offer this in the hope of receiving
something that will make my faith
stronger on a surer ground.

I will request the C A's opinion next Tuesday
Evening - and let you hear it when you next
appear - the C A's already given some responses
on the subject but not having completed my Index
I cannot readily find them.

     Hypothesis of M. Bremser on the Creation
translated from "Bremsers Zoological & Physiological Treatise
on Intestinal Worms  Paris 1824.  page 641
                         See page 93 [?]
Sect I   "Researches in the formation of our planet" says
M. Bremser "have brought the following facts to
light: The last bed to which we have been able to
penetrate is composed of granite and constitutes
the primitive strata., above this are found the
transition strata, placed bed upon: and higher
still, the secondary strata. besides these we distinguish 
alluvial and volcanic strata, in the 
primitive and transition strata we find no traces
of beings who have enjoyed life, it is not until
the first bed of the secondary strata that we find
the remains of organic forms, these for the most
part, belong to the crustacea, of aquatic animals
of the lowest degree or organization, in beds more
recently deposited, and in consequence, higher
in the series, we observe the remains of animals
which once lived upon the earth, in those more
deeply sealed, we discover only the remains of
animals, to which the earth, in its present state
possesses nothing analogous, at least as to species,
and it is only the more recent strata of secondary
mountains which furnish the remains of animals
like ours, or which have al least some affinity
with those which still exist. human bones have 
never been discovered, even in any secondary
statum.
       This structure of the earth leads us to think
215
that when this planet became a separately existing
being in itself. it was in some sort a liquid mass
without form, but fivified; that is to say, endowed
with the living spirit, or still more simply, the
universal life, this last, called by me, living
spirit, must not however be confounded with
the soul of the world, which according to philosophers
has not only created the world, but created itself.
but by the 'living spirit' I understand nothing
else but that which may equally well be called
'life - 'vital power' in a word, the primitive cause
of life in general with which the several worlds, at
the moment of their creation, have been endowed
or rather animated, by the Being of Beings, God
the Creator."
"By little and little, a nucleus consisting of our
primitive strata developed itself in this liquid
and formless mass, the principal cause of the
formation of this nucleus, as well as of the successive
[strat] precipitations upon that nucleus - that
is to say, of the transition strata, and secondary
mountains, may be sought in a particular force
which may be designated a dead force inherent
in matter, as matter, or rather in the spirit which
vivifies the substance and preserves it as an entire
and separate body
The explanation of The formation of the earth
and also of organized bodies, will present fewer
difficulties, if we seek the principal cause in something
of a more elevated nature - that is to say in
spirit itself - in the tendency to rule over matter
and continually to form, by its connexion with it
bodies wholly existing by themselves, as we daily
see in the formation of all organized bodies, in
this view spirit at first seperates the brute matter
and rejects it to the centre of the earth, and thus
the primitive strata are formed. perhaps thousands 
216
of years were requisite to produce this result, for
the formation of these strata apparently arises by
little and little, from the operation of crystallization
after the greater portion of the matter which was
at least favorable to life, that is to say to the life
of those isolated bodies, had been crystallized. the
spirit could then act with more liberty. it would
occasion a revolution, or more properly a fermentation
throughout the entire mass, and the
transition strata would probably be precipitated
on a sudden, however we may presume, from the 
stratified nature of these deposits that many similar
fermentations have contributed to their formation,
up to this epoch (the formation of this transition
strata) the earth would still posess an universal
life, that is to say, a life which had not yet been
divided and communicated to distinct and separate
bodies, for we do not find either in the primitive or
transition formations the trace of any living structure
and still less of any animal organization.
It was not until after the precipitation of these strata
that the spirit was able to avail itself of such and
such portions of matter, and form from them isolated
bodies endowed with individual life, we find the
remains of living bodies in the lower beds of the
secondary strata. which to all appearance, were
formed like the transition strata, after similar
and partial fermentations, the remains of living
bodies of ancient date, which we find in the
inferior beds of the secondary strata, all belong
to aquatic animals: we there find no plants, after
the formation of transition strata and before the
precipitation of the earliest secondary strata it
is to be presumed that no land was yet uncovered
and that there was not any atmosphere. just as 
the moon, a portion more recently detached from
the earth, is still actually without one,
217
In process of time a new revolution or fermentation took effect, the first creation was destroyed by the succeeding precipitation, and the earth was peopled anew by animals which were however of species altogether different from the first, we cannot properly determine how many of these revolutions have occurred, followed by [precipitations], involving on each of those occasions, at least vast spaces of the earth. It is only certain that every precipitation was followed by a new creation, and that man is the produce of the last, for as already observed, no human bone has been discovered, even in the superior beds of the secondary strata, and still farther, we only begin to find the bones of the mammyirae in these superior beds, and M. luvier presumes for this reason, that they are a product of the revolution next before this last, of our earth.
It is still to be expected, in the suppontion of a future precipitation, that beings much more perfect than those which were the result of the preceding will be created. Spirit in man is to matter in the proportion of 50 to 50, with slight differences more or less, for it is sometimes spirit and sometimes matter which has formed man should not be the last, or ganegation it is apparent will arise, in which the spirit will act with greater freedom, and in the proportion of 45, to 25, it results from this consideration, that man has been formed, such as he is, at the most passive epoch which has occurred in the existence of our earth. Man is, unhappily, a middle term between animal and angel, he aspires to develop things, and he cannot reach them, although our modern philosophers sometimes believe this is not the case, man wishes to fathom the first cause of all that is, but he cannot accomplish it, with lower intellectual faculties he would
218
not have had the presumption to form even a wish
for such knowledge, wich would on the contrary
be in his possession if he was endowed with a larger
spirit,
When spirit is about to form, by the commixture
of substances, as new individual life, or to preserve
that which already exists, it is absolutely necessary
that those substances should be in an amorphous
state, if according to the supposition which
we established at the commencement, the entire
of the earth was without form previous to the
existence of organized living beings, and if in
exual accordance with the same supposition these
bodies were developed from the amorphous matter
we ought not surely to be astonished, if the
same phenomenon is now-a-days still to be witnessed,
that is to say, if whatever animalized
matter is found without form, it should develop
itself in new individual life and new organization,
It is true that our infusions do not produce
elephants or whales, and our manure heaps
only mushrooms, and not oaks and pines, but
this is easy to conceive, when we compare the
masses thus in a state of fermentation, who
knows what would be the production of millions
of huge organized bodies submitted at the
same time to an equal degree of fermentation.
prolonged and kept up with care.
All that I have hitherto said, serves to prove that
death is never in question throughout the whole of
organized nature, death is but a transition to a new
life, or new form of life, this is a truth which we find
established in all organic nature, bodies deprived
of life serve not only to the preservation of life already
existing, but it can even develop itslef in new forms
of individual life, such as mouldiness, [nost??ks?]
mushrooms, the green matter of Priestly, the infusories
219
&c , this is proved by indubitable evidence,
  The universal life, or rather the eternal action of
fermentation, has been in some sort transferred
to insulated bodies endowed with life, in every 
animal organization, exists a continual fermentation,
during which new substances are are admitted,
precipitated, appropriated, dissolved,
decompressed, and excreted, in a word, life consists
in a continual decomposition, and new
combination of substances, if we reflect on the 
large quantity of animalized matter without  form
which is found in every animal body, is it astonishing 
that there should be formed of the matter
which the body does not want for its nutrition, or is
even unfit for that purpose, on account of its
peculiar composition, a little mass, an entire
existing by itself, or rather that an intestinal
worm should be formed in this little world
from the example of the great world, in which
has already been developed so many worms of
the earth, this new worm once formed can then
multiply its species by producing animals like
itself, Thus are compelled to think of the primitive
parents of all our known animals, as of animals
originally without parents, and, notwithstanding,
as endow[ow]ed with the faculty of regenerating
their species in a manner altogether different
from the mode by which themselves came into
existence, and indeed the different modes of
generation observed in intestinal worms prove
that the march of creative nature, in little, is
in every respect like its march in the grand,
and that it operates no otherwise in the living
animal body, than it did of old in our living
globe, in fact we find in intestinal worms, 
so to say, a repetition of all the modes of generation
which exist throughout the series of
animal organizations,
220
    With men and animals, like produces
like, consequently the animals which are developed
from them, and in them ought necessarily
to resemble each other, we observe however in the
microcosmus, in man, as an animal subject
to a less dilatory metamorphosis, a difference, or
a predominant tendency to the spontaneous formation
of such or such a parasite, according to this
microcosm as arrived at such or such a degree of
development, this adverting only to our worms,
theres is produced with children in general --
for there is nothing without an exception in this
world -- only ascarides and oxyures, and with
adults cestoides and strongles.
     The certainty, therefore of the primitive formation
of intestinal worms is clearly established
not only by negative proofs, because intestinal
worms cannot arrive in the animal body from
without, but it is also deduced from the analogy
of the primitive formation of infusoria and mouldiness, 
and in fine it is demonstrated by the
indication drawn from the first probably formation
of all living bodies,

CA Mirror  Invoked the CA
7:30 PM
The C.A is here as usual.
Mr MacKenzie recently expressed a wish to introduce me
to his friend the Revd. C. Wood but I have been advised in the
mirror not to do so may I ask your opinion
2491 8982 I think not at present
Both Mr M + his friend are developed as writing mediums
tho as yet their communications are trivial + unsatisfactory
I have earnestly persuaded M not to practice this
sphere of spiritualism, especially as he recently obtained
for a short time the faculty of reading in the crystal
I lent him
2492 8983 If the faculty of Seeing exists in him, Mr.
MacKenzie will be able to develope it if he 
desires it. in a short time you will know
more of him -- from Mr MacKenzies Commun'n"?
I was not aware that he had succeeded
2

yet with the Crystal or that he had seen reading
so plainly.

As he has now proved beyond a doubt the possession of
the faculty of seeing, I hope I have succeeded in 
diverting him from [writing?] or rapping - spiritualism

2493   8984   I hope you have, he will ultimately have
his vision perfect and then the rapping
spirits will sadly interfere with him if
he allows them the chance of communicating
with him

on the           When Mr Anderson appeared he expressed
a great wish to have your opinion upon the Doctrine
of the real presence in the Eucharist - I read the
whole of Mr Andersons remarks - & also mentioned Mr
Denisons case and the tendency amongs Ultra- High -
Church -Priests of the Protestant Church towards the
same belief

2494   8985   In receiving the bread and wine in rememb'ce
of Christ you do not partake either of his
flesh or blood
     In the first place supposing that you
did actually eat of it - that it were the
real person and life of Christ - what good
do you receive with it - It is the Spirit
not the flesh that you require, and if the
Spirit has gone from that flesh and
become pure and exalted through leaving it
why should man take as a remembrance
of him, as a vow to follow in his path --
the mortality that which he has thrown off.
     The receiving of the actual flesh and
blood does no good. it is the receiving the
holy influence of the Spirit that makes
Man nearer to him --

I can easily understand why priests advance the
3
doctrine to excite the wonder of the ignorant & thereby
more firmly establish their own Soul crushing Supremacy
but how even Clergymen & other of undoubted piety
and learning can believe it is to me incomprehensible
except that in "believing thro faith" we set reason at
defiance -

2495
8986
They misconstrue the words of Scripture
those who believe in this -
     The meaning of Jesus Christ was this.
Take this bread and wine as the Symbol
of my body on Earth - of the unity between
flesh and flesh, and eat it as an assurance
of your determination to walk with your
Spirit and your body in the way that
I have led upon Earth. - and by the
semblance of the life which that body
contains should be our unity in Spirit
     Receive a part of this most sacred
Sacrifice in earnest of your vow to heaven
and to me. -

I thank you.
As I have not used this (the Japan) Crystal a long
time may I ask who is still the Spirit of it

2496
8987
ADA

I am going on Thursday Evening to Mr. Tills may
I ask if Ada will kindly show the visions req'd

2497
8988
She will show visions to any one present
having the power of Seeing them.

Mr. Edward Shirley Kennedy in his work "Thoughts on
 Being" has brought forward the old Theory of an
infinite succession of created & destroyed worlds. & that
our present created world in Time may be one of a
number insufficient to determine its order. & he remarks
"Who then are those Angels & ministering Spirits of
Whom we read as beings of another Creation? may
4
they not be erring. Spirits who have passed through
their season of Trial, in an order and in time essentially
distinct from our own. ? It may be that they have 
been embodied Spirits who have lived in unconnected
durations of time each distinct & finite in itself -
and yet further [we] may it be permitted with reverence
to direct the Eye of Thought, and to look upon the
Angels of heaven. as beings who have in other time
passed through that same valley of the Shadow
of death which is our lot, and who are now enjoying
the same light of Truth. which will be our reward"

2498
8989
They are but thoughts, they have nothing
to uphold them - Time is the [present?]
and is the duration of the world and all
Creation, when that work was began
the period of its existence is limited, that
limitation is called Time, every hour
draws nearer to its end and when time
ceases to be, when the Creation like a
[Mouldering?] rain      Eternity begins -
Time is Mans and Earthly, Eternity
is God's and Spiritual and as no time
shall exist after creation - so none existed
before it. The only Creation of God's is
the Universe now existing for which alone the
Efforts of a Saviour have been made.

You in a former response (  ) once mentioned
that you had come from a distance as far beyond
Now as a mortal I 
cannot comprehend how a body - can pass through
Space at that rate when light only Travels at the 
rate of.

2499
8990
You say that you cannot imagine a body
travelling through Space., but I am not -
a body. - there does ot exist in me one
5

particle of matter., I come down like 
Thought. can you imagine the human 
mind seeing [in] its error and alighting 
momentarily on Faith. - of Something 
flashing as it were through the brain & 
bring a memory or a Consciousness of Error. 
and a revelation of the right, if so you can 
but faintly imagine how I see and know 
not with my Eyes and my understanding 
the things that take place on Earth. - 
I see with my whole being and I underst'd 
with it for my whole existence is intelligence
     My whole being is what your mind 
is moulded into form.

When I used the term body. I did not mean a Corporeal 
but a Spiritual Substance. An intelligent Entity -

2500    8991   but it is only a Substance in the Sight 
of Man

May I ask if you have the Knowledge, the faculty or 
Power of discerning what is taking place on earth 
during your approach. to it because if so according 
to the Theory of the Undulation of light, it is believed 
that the light we now receive from some of the fixed 
stars left them thousands of years since & consequently 
if the transactions on earth are reflected into space 
by the Agency of light. You would in your passage 
meet those rays of light which left this Earthy say 
a hundred years ago - & thus become Cognizant of our 
Earthly transactions at that period & all the intervening 
Period to the present moment in your descent 
to the earth. - & thus a Century of our time would be 
but an instant to you., have I made myself 
understood

2501   8992   I do not understand you. I leave the Sphere 
that I am in, & approach the Earth. without
[*6*]

passing through any thing but the Spheres 
beneath me

I see in the Atmosphere the likeness 
of that which is taking place in the world 
I can pass through it without noticing it 
and approach the world without seeing 
more than I desire. or is required of me. 
and light does not preserve events that 
have passed and carry them upwards in 
its progress, the light alone Travels without 
the Shadow of Events.

Mr Kennedy quotes from. [?] [?] Physical Sciences 
the following remarks. "As we must discard the very idea 
of Number as being an Attribute of GOD so must we also 
deny the possibility of any Attribute arising from 
attracted number. we cannot therefore [give?] to His 
Majesty form or Size because these are properties of 
Created Matter., His presence moreover cannot be 
limited to one Spot for position is a Material Effect 
He must extend over Space and Consequently Omnipresence 
must be a Characteristic Attribute of His greatness 
(see also opposite).

[*2502 
8993*] That he can do is undeniable and 
that he does with the influence of his Spirit 
penetrate the very recesses of the Earth 
is likewise true.

But still his being has a place 
he exists a living GOD in a home of his 
own construction for spirit hath its birth 
place and that birth place is His Throne.

Mr Kennedy remarks of the Enemy of Mankind "He 
then is another mighty power the Spiritual being 
of Evil the immaterial adversary of goodness infinite 
in diffusion tho' limited in power - as Eternity is 
in truth. to an Eternal being always present so is
[*7*]

Infinity always present to an infinite being we 
must therefore unhesitatingly dissent from that 
gross and vulgar conception of the "Father of Lies" 
which would give to him either a temporary direction 
a bodily shape, or a limited sphere of existence, He is 
a Spirit and as such he both enters into the heart 
of every man and occupies infinity - All immaterial 
being is essentially omnipresent and omniscient, 
and we are taught that Satan is Eternal, omnipresent 
and omniscient - All immaterial being is not essentially 
omnipotent All merciful, or immutable, and Stan 
we know, is not omnipotent, nor all merciful, nor 
immutable -

[*2503 
8994*] He is right in his idea of the Power of Evil

Mr K. also observes "Number is a property of Matter 
we are therefore forbidden to regard it as an attribute 
of the immaterial - The faculties of Man therefore 
cannot tell the number of Human Souls, who, 
throughout the unlimited universe are now working 
out their salvation in fear and trembling and the 
Conviction is strongly forced upon us as the wondrous 
truth flashes upon our Mind that the immortal 
immaterial Souls which throughout eternity are 
Embracing unlimited pace, are endless in number 
infinite in repetition

[*2504 
8995*] I must here again differ with him, granting 
full that the influence of GOD pervades 
the influence and that the influence of 
Evil does the same, that they both meet 
in Opposition, strongest in the heart of 
Man because he has the power of decision 
between them - I must still deny any 
thing but their influence in creation 
their presence is not actually there because 
it is impossible for a Spiritual body any
8995
8
More than a material body to be divided
when that division comes the whole structure
falls, loses its power, is divided against itself
and becomes each part of little strength
whereas the whole together is a body of
supreme strength sending forth this ____ghly
influence either for good or evil. 

And so I have said the Spirit has its
place and that abode is Heaven.

Now if it is only the influence and
not the presence that exists in man
Heaven cannot exist in him because that is
the dwelling place of God, and as that
influence comes from His dwelling place
the abode of his body must be beyond &
aborn man, and if his penetrating influence
is Almighty and all powerful it can bang
through undivided space - more - it flows
continually and increasingly without
intermission livelihood living from Him to
His.

It comes down to Man and it also
comes down to the ___ of His Creating therefore
the highest and the lowest is below Him
and you do not approach his home, his
presence as the birth place of Spirit and it
You have passed through and left behind
You every body even if light curled by
him. 

Archbishop Whelchey in his essay on some of the precediantes
of the Xhan Religion alludes (see Purposes) to
the sleep of the Soul -- & Mr. Kennedy after mentioning its
______ by Oz Gregory. In being "directly contradictory
to many of the most ______ _________ ________
in the New Testament" says rejecting then this no him. 


 
[*9*]

we are obliged to admit that the Soul ever [confirms?] in 
a State of Consciousness; that by the friendly hand of death 
she is liberated from the prison house; and that without 
Suspension of being, she then knows herself to be a free 
and unfettered Spirit, forbidden further trial or 
opportunity for repentance before receiving either for 
happiness or misery the Eternal sentence of her 
Creator

[*2505 
8996*] He is right. Death is an awaking not 
a sleeping of the Soul.

Mr Dresser is unfortunately prevented by buss. from 
being here this Evening may I call Mohammed Ali 
to ascertain when we can receive the Explanation of 
the Nineveh Antiquities

[*2506 
8997*] You must call him, I cannot tell you 
whether he will appear

May I call him in this mirror or in the Eram 
Glass 
or Japan Crystal.

[*2507 
8998*] In the Eram Glass. 
I do not think he will appear this Evg. 
There is no objection to your calling him. 

The CA left

[*8999*] "He cannot appear this Evening

When will he appear

No answer.

Eram Glass

9'20 Requested a Spiritual Vision

[*9000*] Now its veiled, Theres the roof of a building Arches


and fluted pillars - all sparkling - it seems like 
jewels, there is a row of pillars supporting the roof 
on each side and at the end is a chair with a 
canopy over it, amethysts and rubies in stone upon 
the top of the canopy, and each stone seems to shine
light within if as tho the sun was shining 
through each stone, there appears an image in 
each stone, very fair and beautiful faces, each 
each different but all very fair and beautiful, 
there is a splendid chair under the canopy,
There are green stones, purple amethysts and rubies 
and white stones. They are all in a pattern, they are in 
stars, the white stones seem diamonds in the middle 
this. 

Emeralds 
Amethysts Diamonds Rubies 
Rubies Emeralds Amethysts 

And in each stone face as if dauguerytyped 
and over the middle stone a plain scroll with 
this inscription 
goes "The Hall of the Images of Holy Saints"
On the top of the canopy there is something rising
up but indistinct - its a white bird standing 
on a golden pedestal it appear a carved bird not 
a live one - the head looking down this way and 
the wings spread out towards the back. It holds 
in its beak a large single stone and that appears 
to have a [band?] on it. 
Now all the pillars there are stars of these 
stones and in the middle of each stone there 
seems a likeness - now there's a flag gone from 
out of the pillars on each side with reading on each. - 
On the first pillar on the left of the glass.
[?] 1. Charity and Mercy is God in Man        11
9002 2. Faith is the door of Salvation
3. Peace and Unity is the pass word
right side 
3. Jesus Christ is the regenerator & Saviour of Man
9003 2. His peace passeth all understanding
1. And its existence is known for it existeth in the
    hearts of his followers

Now theres some [???mis] going towards the Canopy
from this End. Theres three walked first, they
are three spirits.

(Right)
a spirit
in a white dress a blueish
Temple robe & wings and 
carrying a Crown on a
Cushion.

a spirit 
in a white robe Crimson
scarf which pulls down
over the arms, Wings
carrying a Cross laid
horizontally & holding
it in the middle

(Left)
a spirit
in white, Scarlet
scarf, wings &
carrying a sword
and half moon.

They haven't any thing on their heads--now theres 3 more

(Right)
a Spirit
with light curly hair
all in white shadowy
robe, fastened round
the wrist with a band
of diamonds -- Wings

a Man
dressed in black with
white hair

(Left)
a spirit
with light curled 
hair. Wings &
all in white, with
band as the other

The Spirits are very shadowy they are leading the man in 
the middle -- they are turned towards him -- he looks firmer
& heavier & more solid
Now theres 3 more spirits they appear flying their 
wings are opened up higher -- they have all hold of 
one clear white horse which they are flying with
[*12*]

Now theres 3 more, They are all in White with 
wings they have each a book in his hand, the 
have dark hair and a circle of Stones round the head 
they are the last

Now the Middle one of the 1st. 3 has sat down 
under the Canopy and the others have turned round 
their faces this way. - and the three that were flying 
have gone right over. the old mans head - and the 
three walking with books have separated and stand 
in each side of the Canopy & the other remains here 
Now the place is all lit up with a beautiful 
Golden light - so bright I can scarcely see - The Spirits 
with the books on each side of the canopy, appear 
singing out of the books.

Now the old man kneels on the step of 
the Canopy and the one that sits under the Canopy 
puts the Crown on the Mans head. its a plan 
gold band with 3 balls, Now he has taken it off 
again and put the cross through it and on the 
End of the Cross he has put through the Crown he 
has got the half moon on. - The old man has 
taken out a piece of Vellum a Square just large 
enough to lay the Cross and half moon on - now 
one of the Spirits has taken hold of the Corner 
nearest the Chair and the old man holds the 
other 2 Corners and the one on the Chair lays the 
Crown & Cross & half moon on the Vellum now he's 
taken the Sword and presses through the Crown 
on to the Vellum - then each part of the Cross & 
then pricks the half moon. - Now he has taken 
them off the Vellum, and there is the pattern 
left on the Vellum - marked out black.

Now he has taken them off the Parchment 
& put them all on the Cushion & handed it to the 
one in the bluish purple robe - They are still
[*13*]

singing out of the books, Now I can see the old 
man is changing his robes are getting paler 
and paler, and his face and hands seem to 
dissolve and get clearer & clearer and his hair gets 
brighter - more golden & brighter and he seems all 
together altered - and wings are coming and his 
likeness seems to go up into the Stone, the Spirits 
are holding above his head - Now his likeness 
is perfect in the Stone. And his Appearance is 
like the others as clear and as beautiful, and 
Young as they are he holds up the parchment 
in his hands and stands a little aside - Now 
the one in the Chair comes down, I cannot 
see any of their feet - they are walking with the 
old man, that was, to the first pillow on the left 
Next the Canopy - the three Spirits come down 
with the Stone and put it on the Clear white 
Marble and there's his likeness, Now he is 
taking a flag out - its the other side of the Parchmt. 
and putting it up like a flag over the Stone 
that has his likeness on and theres words 
come on that.

[*9004*] Truly the followers of Christ have their reward"

Now he is coming this way with the one that 
put the Crown on and the otehrs are following 
behind singing - Now its going - its all gone -

1/4 past 10. PM.

Japan Crystal - At Mr Tills

Invoked Ada to allow a Vision - & called J.C.

Miss Emily inspected No Vision

Mr Waller Till " No Vision

Miss Frances Till " No Vision
[*14*]

Mr. T. inspected

The Crystal veiled and after about 10' rays of exquisitely 
Color & light appeared, with the outline of a face and 
wings, this changed to an appearance a mean in armour 
but the head indistinct, afterwards an old man 
appeared - these appearances were all vague & indistinct

[?] die 30 Sept 1856.

1/4 to 8. PM. Invoked the C.A.

As I cannot be favored with the continuance 
of your work on Metaphysics I wish to ask some 
questions relating to the Spirit World.

[*2508 
9005*] do so

I was last Wednesday at Mr Cox's to visit Mr [?] 
and Mr Cox related some curious facts he had personally experienced we also observed that crystal working was 
the lowest kind of Spiritualism, and I found him 
still of the same opinion as when I just met him 
14 or 15 years since - "that there was no possible use 
in prayer Invocations Calls. or Exorcism" as we so 
completely & totally differed discussion was out of 
the question - may I ask an explanation of the 
different orders of Spirits, and their Offices, that 
I may find some clue to their discordant opinions 
& assertions

[*2509 
9006*] I will not answer that Question now 
as it is treated of by me in the book 
I am now about to give you

You will think with me it is better 
to wait and receive the whole than to have 
an answer that from its structure must 
be imperfect

In todays Times there is a Statement which leads 
me to suppose we are on the Eve of another view
[*15*]

With Russia may I ask if that is your opinion

[*2510 
9007*] I do not think so at present.

I have to thank you for the Spiritual Vision you 
favored us with last [?]die - from my Seers descrn. 
it must have been marvellously beautiful.

[*2511 
9008*] The Vision[s] that you saw last Tuesday 
Evening is one of the many places that 
exist in the lowest Sphere.

As I am not prepared this Evening with any Quests. 
may I ask if we can see Mr Anderson

[*2512 
9009*] You can see Mr Anderson

I called Mohamed Ali last [?]die but he did 
not appear.

[*2513 
9010*] I do not know whey he could not appear

If I call him this evening in the Mirror [may] 
we may see him

[*2514 
9011*] Yes

If any &c

[*2515 
9012*] I have not this Evening

The CA left

8 PM. Invoked Mohamed Ali

No Vision

After much delay & calling I asked to be 
informed when he would appear.

[*9013*] "The CA has desired Mohamed Ali 
to appear, and cannot tell why he does 
not do so.

Shall I remove the Seal

[*9014*] No

Will he appear any Evening next week

[*9015*] He will appear at 8 oClock on Friday 
Evening

Next Friday or Friday Week.

[*9016*] Next Friday.
[*16*]

1/4 past 8.

Called Mr Anderson

He is here in gray Trousers and Waistcoat - very light 
gray and black frock coat - collar & scarf round his 
Neck, whilst I was writing he said

[*9017*] I hope you are better this Evening

As you requested I asked the C A his views in 
the real presence in the Eucharist.

[*9018*] I am much obliged to you for your 
Kindness

I read the response (No) can you understand me

[*9019*] I can well 
The assurance there is decided, that it is 
not. the real person partaken of by us.

The CA has promised me a continuation of his 
Metaphysical Work.

[*9020*] You read to me a great portion of his last 
work and I trust I shall be favored 
with some of the forthcoming

I shall have great pleasure in doing so

[*9021*] I have no doubt it will be very interesting 
It seems to me very strange that these 
Spirits each apparently Truthful, from 
Every evidence that we receive we are obliged to 
believe them good. I am not speaking of 
the C A but of others. - That their 
opinions should differ so materially even 
on points of faith, and on religious 
doctrines, one would have thought, at least, 
I should, that supposing the knowledge 
of some to be more limited than others, that 
the higher the class of Spirits the more 
extended their learning, the highest being 
the most perfect, I should have thought 
that we would have had the same
[*17*]

opinions as they, no two different ones 
could have existed upon the same subject 
and that each one would have had the 
others extent of Knowledge as he entered 
the Spheres above him, that all Spirits 
in the same Sphere would have had 
the same Knowledge of truth. and that 
nothing else could have existed so that 
however limited. or extended the Knowledge 
of this Truth might be there could be no 
diversity of Opinion

do you mean all Spirits of the same Sphere or 
State.

[*9022*] I mean all pure and good Spirits 
between Man and GOD

I have never found any discrepancies in the 
CA's answers but what upon referring to him, I 
have had explained satisfactorily, during the 
late E.S.'s time when I invoked planetary 
Spirits I received very discordant answers 
I think they differ very much.

[*9028*] They may that is what I should 
much wish to understand 
I must confess that it seems to me 
incongruous, looking at it thro' limited 
reason, I think that as to spirits there 
can be no doubt, no uncertainty, the one 
True religion, there can really be but one, 
to them an ever present fact. And that 
when they differ in the Communications 
that they give to us, it seems to shake that 
religion and make it appear as though it 
existed with them as with us

I have not asked any Spirits but the C.A. for 
information to guide me in religious doctrine
Seven homina [?]

or Faith and I am not therefore aware of their
Views but if you will give me the names of every
Spirit I will call them, learn their Sentiments
and then I can speak to the CA. about it as of
my own knowledge, do you understand my motive

9024  I do
There are several Spirits I can name to you
who have appeared to me. and Each have
differed from the other materially , do you
remember my telling you of the one that
appeared When first I used my Mirror
he plainly stated that there was no Soul,
no hereafter, no GOD existing— nature was
the produce of Chance and that Jesus Christ
was but a word— that is not what I
would tell you.  as it was afterwards 
explained—
    There is Constantine if I were you I would
Call him.

Constantine is an old friend of ours. can you give
me the name of another

9025   The Spirit I named to you the other Evening
Seven-o-mina and the other one I named
to you, I forget his name, now I believe
them both to be high Spirits

Can you give me Seven-o-mina's description

9026  He seems larger than the generality of
Spirits and rather more masculine , fair
hair bound round the head with tiara[s]
of Gold, he is dressed in blue with a band
of the same Colored Stones, as the robe round
the waist the wings are also a transparent
blue color and what has surprised me
exceedingly is , that he seems to stand , I
have seen his feet.  and they always
[*19*]

appear resting on a Square Slab. 
Have you ever seen any feet.

My Seer has very rarely seen the feet of any Spirit 
Never those of the CA or any high Spirit

[*9027*] I think that makes no different

Is [Ellesmo?]. the name you mean

[*9028*] Yes.

May I ask his description

[*9028*] He is dressed in white and appears on a 
cloud the vapor coming nearly up to the 
middle so that the lower part of him 
is completely hidden, he has long fair hair 
[curled?], and wears nothing over it, but on 
the forefinger of his right hand he has a 
diamond - it has an image in it, or 
letters. or figures of some kind, I have 
often tried to see but I cannot make it 
out exactly. as you do not see many Spirits 
I suppose you have never noticed the 
differences there are in the different things 
that seem to live as it were in the Stones 
worn on all parts.

Will you ask them to appear some Evening

[*9030*] I asked them last Wednesday and they 
will do so.

does it matter when they are called or can 
they only appear on a Tuesday to me

[*9031*] They will appear any [when?]

I will then call them. Have you ever made 
any inquiries as to that branch of the F.R.C. 
called T.I.

[*9032*] You mean in the Mirror 
Yes I have.

May I ask you to favor me with any information 
as it is a Subject which interests me much.
20

9033  I have been much interested in the subject
lately, I belong to a secret society in Spain
for some years. and when I came to London
after the late war.  I was anxious to know
of any member of the FRC. met there.
I did not gain much information , I bought
several books , nothing at all particular and
then I began asking the questions of some
of the spirits
     I am prevented by several things
from joining my lodge of Freemasons in
England.
     The answers that I have recorded to
my questions have been nothing new
Nothing that I did not know before.  &
chiefly related to that part of the Society
who met at. "——"
     I saw their Crypt there but the
language used was foreign to me — there
are 7 or 8 & 20 brethren ,  I immediately asked
the Spirit of the Mirror if it was not  possible
for the language to be translated, or if there
was not a person present in their society
who could speak in a language that I
understood.,  Latin I could manage
sufficiently. to understand  the subject of
their discourse   Spanish  or  Italian at
least Italian & English  I could read well
& Spanish is of Course may native language
— One of them was an Italian and after
the meeting had separated I received from
him the substance of their discourses

Your knowledge & Experience coincides with mine I have
several. R. C. books & manuscripts.

9034  Amongst those who now meet at "_______"
[*21*]

there are Philosophers and Doctors professing 
only Theology who discuss Metaphysics 
more than any thing Else. so that in that 
way it may be connected. (a)

Have you read [Long-Stillings?] work, he was I believe 
the first that mentioned their meeting at "-"

[*9035*] I have his work on Pneumatology.

Mohamed Ali has promised to appear next [?]die 
and M MacKenzie will then be here.

[*9036*] Coming next Friday is he.

[*9037*] It seems strange another unaccountable 
trait of Spiritualism - You must think 
that I. raise nothing but doubts, and 
difficulties, but I find that whenever a 
person is a Naturalist, or directs his 
special attention to the study of Animated 
Creation he becomes mixed up and in 
some measure united with the lowest 
grades of Spirits

I dont think it right to investigate 
the hidden laws of Nature, you lower 
yourself without raising them. by 
communion for I believe from the informn. 
that I have received that there is Spiritual 
life attached to all things.

There is one thing I have universally 
found that Naturalists have an Evil 
influence attached to them and that has 
been given me as the reason

Your remark is very strange I will ask the
22
the C. A, his views upon the Subject

9038  I am afraid of tiring you or I would fetch
my minutes and read to you the whole of the
particular passages.

I thank you I shall feel obliged by your coming so
[?] now he has gone — (1') he's come back with his red book

9039  Some time ago from some slight circumstance
I observed to Constantine my antipathy as
to taking the lives of Animals , even those
that ere useful  to that he answered.

9040  "That it was necessary to the very exist'ce
of man as a race that he should eat
Animal food, and that brutes were
created for that purpose, but he said
when it was intended that man
should have the Knowledge of what was
Good for him and act upon it. and
make use of what he killed, he did
what was right and fulfilled a law
of Nature, but when he destroyed
life unnecessarily — when he took that
[po] mighty power that he could not
give — so immeasureably beyond
his control , so full of mysterious
Power he did more than was lawful
for as all life is spirit  and all Spirit
an Emanation of a greater Spirit
Even in the destruction of one of the
Reptiles of the earth. he brought upon
himself the influence — slightly of
Course. when compared to that
attending murderers , but still the
same power and that his Evil
influence which attaches to the
systematic destroyer of life is the
23
"power of the Spirit when released
from the bodies of the Animals killed
by Man — and this Spirit released
existing in its own form is the same
I believe as what is called
Wandering Spirits , I never saw
one in human form have you,
and they do not have any form in
their real existence, it is not necessary
that they should do so when they
are speaking from a person in a 
clairvoyant state , they have no
particular form when they are
witnessing the actions, or reading
the looks or [reasoning?] up the words
of man.

Cabalistical writers always [mention?] that they assume
various forms by choice but only man's when
constrained by [?]            I will enquire of the CA

9041  And even if that is the case may not
the spirits of wickedness , disembodied
from man , mix with these spirits of
Animals and altogether form a body of
Spirit floating over the earth & mixing
with us

Selina is inspecting the Ada Crystal her vision is
very indistinct can you tell me any means of
developing her power

9042  I dont know of any , I cant see why
there should not be one.

Yet there are many who possess the happy faculty
who are quite ignorant of it & to whom it is
consequently useless

9043  It is unaccountable It is a pity that
the power is not universal, limited of
[*24*]

of course so that men could not see 
each others Affairs or actions, but could 
only communicate with Spirits either good 
or bad.

I would really sooner possess the power of Seeing 
than have 500L given me

[*9044*] Yes but I should be sorry if Money could 
buy it

Yes so should I.

[*9045*] It is a pleasure to look at it as coming 
from a source where there can be no 
distinction amongst those on Earth

I saw Mr Cox the other Evening, but as we are so 
dramatically opposed as to the Method of 
Crystal Work. Argument was out of the question 
do you know him

[*9046*] I knew that he was a Spiritualist, 
what I have heard of his Opinions I 
dislike he seems so headstrong & obstinate 
I have never spoken to him on the Subject.

[*9047*] That shows them not so high as the others 
I suppose.

[*9048*] Yes I decidedly think that the more 
Spiritual their Communications the higher 
their Authority Every Idea that we can 
form of purity teaches us to believe so

I see by the newspaper there is a namesake of yrs. 
Major Anderson - been Compromising himself 
now - he laughs

[*9049*] Thank you for associating me with 
People so highly respectable.

You once promised to favor me with your real

Can you see Miss (to Selma)

Can you see if there is any room in it

[*9051*] I cant see in that one

Can you see in it if she places it agt the Mirror 
Selma placed it there 
Can you see in it.

[*9052*] Yes but it is quite clear

Did I ever tell you of a form I had given to me 
to attach an Evil Spirit to any one of whatever 
rank or Station

[*9053*] I think not perhaps it was during the 
time I was away so long

I mentioned the Circumstance (see Vol.) & 
the Name of the Spirit

[*9054*] do you remember at all what they were 
There is another one that Spirit uses 
but that is a cross of plates.

There are Circles about the size of 
a Shilling each, land slightly one over 
the other both ways the two are joined 
exactly in the middle and on each of the 
Circles that are made of Metals there 
is a Character inscribed

Have you got a Copy of the one you are relating 
to me

[*9055*] I have got one made in Metal I never 
use it, I have not seen it since I have 
begun my Mirror, but I have not 
destroyed it. I thought there was no 
harm in doing so if I merely kept it as 
a Curiosity and treated it as others I 
have picked up of the same description

I will get you to show it me another time.
26

9056     I dont know whether I shall do right 
in bringing it here, I am quite willing 
to show it you.

I thank you I will call you in the Oval mirror 

9057    let it be so then

As it is getting late we will if you please End our 
Action.

9058     I was going to say So. I have been to Anglesia
all day I am pretty tired and will wish 
you good night.

It is rather thick and some reading's Come

9059     "Mohamed Ali regrets that it is
impossible for him to appear this Evening

I also regret the circumstance will MA inform
me what rising will be convenient to him

9060     He will appear to you next Tuesday
Evening for a few minutes

Will he then make an Appointment to give
an explanation of the Nineveh Antiquities

9061    Yes.

May we see Seven O Mina
Emma said The C A has Come., and said,

2516     9062     "I am aware I have come uncalled."

We are indeed pleased to have you with us, but
as it is not your Evening I did not intend trespassing 
upon you - can you tell me why MA has not 
appeared this Evening.
27

2577
9063
I am aware of Mr Mackenzie being present
by appointment to receive the communication
of MA.  I do not know the reason why
he has not appeared. , but as he has not
done so . I would willingly answer any
Questions that he might with to propose
or show visions of other spirits

I mentioned the Circumstance of M M. & his friend
Mr Wood inspecting the Crystal & subsequently
developing the faculty of writing mediumship.
to [?] I much deprecated & requested the C A's Views

2578
9064  You know what evil is   the powers of
Evil and from whence they spring and
You would not willingly communicate
directly with that source, then why do
You encourage & make use of the means
that lead indirectly and not less surely
to it.
     There is very little gained by your
interviews with these Spirits the inform.n
is very limited the sentiments are such
as those which come from every heart.
without the Agency of any spirits
     They do no good  and it must seem
to you upon consideration that pure
Spirit — the same as your mind, Your
thoughts  Your intellect & your reason
purified from every dross, every thing
earthly taken form it . with only its
quality of goodness, and those made
more powerful. that is the qualities of
GOD in you disembodied , does it seem
to you that, that spiritual body emanating
from you[r] would like to come back to the
scene it had left and wrangle with the
28
Earth., the material and the mortality
it had forsaken — No. it does not [?]
if those [?] qualities of your spiritual
body should be repulsed how much more
so should they who are the messengers
of GOD partakers of His Glory and the
dwellers near His Throne.

I read Mr Makenzies MS. copy of "Investigator $
response as to writing mediumship.

2519
9065   It is possession there is force used, force
is low and degrading , and belonging to
Earth. , force that makes man write is
not used from without —
     If his hand were moved from without
the means would be visible , for material can
only touch material, can only make itself
felt.  but when the Spirit enters the life
of Man. and impels him to motion
it possesses him.  And if it possesses
the hand how. can it get to the hand
without possessing the body likewise
and any means that has influence
over man except through his reason ,any
power that guides him except through
his intelligence, he should shun turn
from and avoid as he would from an
Enemy of his Everlasting peace. as from
one who would make him the
instrument of his own destruction

I mentioned Mr Andersons view that being a
Naturalist occasioned Evil influences & asked
his opinion

2520
9066   It has. the destryoees of life, for
unnecessary objects receive that which
they cannot destroy — I have said
29
destroy life, I should rather have said
those who separate the spirit from the body
for that which eternally exists cannot
be destroyed.—
     If you drive the spirit from out of
its habitation it must find a rating place
elsewhere and it seems as tho the lives of
these creatures revenged themselves on their
destroyer by hovering near him & surround
him with a seeming blight, the atmosphere
laden with their wrongs.

Mr Mackenzie & I was discussing the Subject when
the C A continued his response.

2521
9067  I have not at present in a short
time I shall treat more largely of life
and then you will see that the gifts
which the Creation in Common have recd.
from their Almighty maker are not by even
the noblest of that creation man. with
ought but humility and respect,
     When he destroys life unnecessarily, be
it the life of a Man or the life of a fly
he does that which is unlawful, for he
turns the Course of Nature and he interferes
with GOD's own work  which he alone
knows how and when to End.
     Life is man's and in the possession
of it he can do all that seems to him
reasonable and just. all for which he
can assign a rational cause. but death
and all beyond it belongs to GOD alone.

With your permission I will read, an address given
by a $ Alastes thro' the hands of Mr Mackenzie
as a writing medium . in "Magic as a Science"
may I solicit your view
30

2522
9068
I must dispute every word of it
Magic is not a Divine Art for all Magic is
black and if out of corruption & even fiilth
pure nutriment [even] for the body can be found
does that in any way connect it with the
Spirit - An unholy Man may be made
righteous, but whilst he is unholy the face
of God is created from him. . The Holy
influence is gone from his heart, and he
Can do no good, but when he becomes 
just his nature is Changed, and he is as
another man., in the Eyes of his now
gratified father, nay more than this good
can never arise out of Evil

I was explaining the difference between [?] & [?] to
Mr M. When the C A said.

2523
9069
My distinction of Magic is this
All those formulas in which Spirits are
conjured to appear in the name of other

involves only a prayer to GOD. to allow.

Mr. M. will you kindly inform me if it was the [S]
Mystery who gave the response

2524
9070
I cannot, I was aware that Mystery had
promised to appear and is also your GS.

I have several times invoked [Courage?] to appear
without any vision will you kindly give me any
special instructions besides those contained in that
response.

9071
There are no means of forcing its developmt

But how is Mr M. to know when the faculty is

So far as this the knowledge of all

that the records of [and] Actions and Events

engraved not alone on the stars, not

if Man establishes his free will as his

9081  Certainly not,  rather to be there [as a]

You can having first made a method

the System is practiced upon a complete

[*9126*] I only gave my name

There appeared to be only two letters

[*9127*] Seven o mind

Are you aware of my GSs Courage Mystery and 
Accumulation, they are of your order

[*9128*] I know of them. 
I know that they exist, and of the same 
order, I do not communicate with them 
I could do so if requested

May I ask how it is that at Mr Croslands, so 
many spirits appear at once & uncalled for.

[*9129*] bad regulation

Is it owing to the Seeress Miss A. giving her opinions 
upon the responses as they are given

[*9130*] Yes and because so many means are 
used. at different times of procuring 
the Communications

Will you kindly favor me with advice to give 
Miss A. as to the regulation of her Mediumship

[*9131*] She should not be mesmerized because 
that makes her the means of Spirits 
entering her body.

Spirits should not be allowed to hold 
Communion with her by writing or rapping 
or showing power by any means and 
they should not be allowed by her, to 
come into her presence, unasked & uncalled 
for. - 

If so many means of Communication 
are used she gives herself entirely to their 
power and is but a passive instrument 
in their hands and a struggle takes
44
place between them for ascendancy, and
when that is the case, neither the
visions nor the reading which she sees can
be depended upon, and being excessively 
Nervous She carries within herself, the power
of making Still more confused the
communications that are otherwise so indistinct,
through being given by various classes
[*KM*]  and by different means.

As I may have some difficulty in persuading
her to alter her method of writing can you give
me some means of Convincing her that your advice
comes from a Correct and Spiritual source.

9132   I do not know how you can convince her
except by Argument - by showing her the
ill effects they have upon herself and
persuading her to give it a trial for a time.

[*KM*]   will you kindly appear if called at Mr C's &
repeat this advice

9133   I cannot appear to Miss Andrews herself

Will you inform one of her GS[s] Comfort or Innocence
& beg them to appear & advise her

9134   They will not do that because they allow
her to use the influence she now does by
holding [influence] intercourse with different Spirits

Will you allow one of Mine to appear and do so

9135   I will seek them out and Communicate
with them upon it.

I am desirous of developing my faculty of Seeing
in a Mirror or Crystal and of giving up rapping
and writing mediumship

9136   It is indeed desirable that Spirit & Man
Should be Separated for it is not right that
Flesh and Spirit should join on Earth

Whilst trying to develop my faculty of Crystal
Mr. MacKenzie appears very uncertain about the time_ as he 
    altered it 2 or 3 times after this --
45 

Mirror seeing will you kindly appear to ask me 
in so doing

9137   I will

May I ask. - As the planets in their various Aspects 
have influence upon our Earth. - has this Earth 
also certain Effects upon the other planets.

9138   No it is not so
The Earth has the whole of their influence 
but it gives none in return, for you must 
recollect that all and each of the planets 
have a perfectly different nature - 
     You are the only Men, they are Spirits

Am I to understand that none of the planetary bodies
are inhabited but this Earth.

9139   There is only one Earth and one race of 
Men., that is one class of beings who have 
separate from all others, combined in their 
existance flesh & Spirit - who are living 
bodies of matter fraught with intelligence 
and who while without being able to lift 
themselves a foot from their Native matter 
from the matter from which that body 
sprang are possessed within themselves 
of the qualities and Endowments of GOD 
are possessed at once of the lowest of His 
Creative Power, and the highest of His 
Attributes -

May I ask if the Time of birth given in my Horos: 
is Correct

9140   It is very Accurate.

Are there any means of Rectifying Nativities except 
by Accidents.

9141   I know of no other.

how is Mr M. to use his [Teleson?] when made

9142   he must wear it about his person except
This was a Talisman of ♃  made according to the Form in Agrippa
     which Mr. John Denley the bookseller - had given to me in June
     1842. and carried about me ever since -- Nov 18[?]2 - poole -
46

must place it upon the Table and the

                      ♂︎die14th Oct 1856
[?] PM              Invoked the C A.
May I again bring before you the Subject of the 
The existence of human Souls, a favorite Theory of the 
late E.S. and one in which  as you are aware  I have
taken much interest -- I place the following views 
of Origin before you upon this subject.  (a)

2537   9146   I believe them so entirely wrong that it is 
difficult for me to make any remark
     I know them to be wrong for my very
existence and being comes from the source
in opposition to them.

Of course the question of a Succession of Worlds is a
mere matter of philosophical Curiosity, it cannot
affect us as living mortals

2538   9147    And yet it does for to obtain Truth and 
Knowledge, you must thoroughly investigate
all branches of the Subject -- so on the 
greatest of all Subjects, Religion, it is quite
Necessary that every branch and even every
twig therefrom should be thoroughly looked
for and you cannot investigate without
47
pausing well to consider and give weight to
the Errors as well as the Truths , you must
enquire into and form opinions on what
may take place at the last.
     For if you weigh well the arguments on
either side , that is whether Earth shall
succeed Earth. throughout Eternity, or thro'
lengthened time or whether time shall cease
to Exist with the world , or whether the nature
of man is changed -- and in opposition to
this    .  Is man the first and the last
Creation — the world his living resting place
— Eternity only Spiritual — And the earth
Nothing again as at the beginning — you touch
upon that. And if you succeed in forming
right conclusions you obtain one of the most
important Spiritual doctrines , and one that
is Connected with the whole religion of
Christianity , of faith, and of GOD —

With me the Chief reason for the supporting of the
[?] Existence was the difficulty of Concerning
how at every Child birth a new Soul Sprang into
existence because that which has a beginning in time
May also have an End in Time—

2539  9148   You mean life not soul.
No I mean Soul. Thus there are living instances of
Man and his Wife having 20 Children each having
a soul.   from whence did those separate souls
Emanate —
 
2540   9149   I understand you
that life comes into the Child at Birth
from Spirit Sources , when the material body
is born , the spirit then takes possession
and that spirit which is if we may so
term it. The splitting up of the one great
48

Spirit is in its connection with the body
- Life - so that it has not a beginning at
the Childs birth, and in its separation from
the body at the Mortals death, it then
becomes Soul and that being the case it
has no end.

When in Embryo a child lives, and when born assumes
visible actual life - possessed of a Soul to be thereafter
accountable for the Actions of its life in a body which
has by imperceptible gradations attained maturity
whence then did that Soul spring

2541    9150     It is an immediate Emanation from the 
Divinity -
But what is necessary for the animation
of one body at its first coming into existence 
is but such an atom from His existance - of
His being - as to be all but a Nullity
it is just good Spirit and that is all
because it has left for [a] Mortal life,
circumstances, companions, Education and
all things of the world to develope it - and
make it human.  with tendences either
to the divinity from which it springs
or to the Evil which is continually
tempting it.

If in this Christian & Pious Country this Land of
propogating the Bible - & Evangelizing the heathen of
other lands - All men were treated as "one flock
in Christ" your Conclusions would appear just
It is Easy for well fed priests with "Tithe pig and
good fat capon lined" to preach to "well-to-do-
respectables. - the reward of Virtue & the Everlasting
Punishment of Sin - but what are we to think
of the future existence of the Souls of those poor
starving beings, born into the world in Crime
49
reared in Crime and having nothing but crime to depend
upon for their Wretched existence

2542  9151   There are Three things to look upon.
If the doctrines preached by the professors of
religion were true and the punishment of
Any sin was everlasting . GOD would indeed
be unjust and revolting as a Supreme being
and His Creation would be the victims of
this treacherous power - — but it is not so
such doctrine profanes the Church
dedicated to his name —
     And again the circumstances that
make one man rich and another man poor
and so bring a degradation and misery [?]
Poverty — and the rank and Station from
wealth. , is not by the law of GOD.  but is
made and Sanctioned by man alone .
Whatever gift received by man from His
Creator. , is given equally to all , there is
no Distinction  no favor , the Goods of the
Earth. , the richest treasures of Nature and
every thing the world contains is given
to Man as a Race . the governing of that
and of himself is left to his own wisdom
Were the meek doctrines of the Saviour
of all men , the guide of those having
power and dominion upon Earth.— civilization
at least would not be so degraded.
     And again  There are many , You
have spoken of those , who know of no virtue
and therefore cannot follow it who have no
example and therefore no desire to walk
in the upright way, who know not the
meaning of the word religion and therefore
cannot follow its precepts. who have
See my figure & Revolution opposite [Colir?] 21. & Rx 9115.
50
heard not of a GOD and therefore cannot
adore him, and I say and boldly proclaim
it that for these and for such as these
more than for those, infinitely more, who
are clothed in Scarlet and Jewels and
worship GOD surrounded by their ill
gotten wealth  did Christ  the son of GOD
die upon the Cross.

here cause me some uneasiness

2544  9153   I had intended mentioning this
I looked for a calamity or at least
misfortune befalling one near to you
but I may safely say that it is averted
and I can congratulate you on having 
passed another anniversary of your birth
with benefit to yourself, and I earnestly
pray that you may go on increasing
and laying up in story the good things
that perish not.
     I trust another year and every
other year will make you happier and
that we may be united as much on
this earth as the mysterious boundary
will permit, and that when that boundary
is passed the will of God may be
sought by both of us  my  dear friend
as one. 
57

If aware of the wishes alters &c.

2545  9154   I am

I mean when addressed &c

2545  9155   I am.

Have I still your permission to call Seven O mina

2547   9156   I have not the least objection to his app'e
he is a good Spirit —
     I would rather that you should call
others besides me for as you have faith in
me — so have I also in you — for I feel
Confident that amongst the diversity of
opinions , You will only Receive that as
having value which you believe   to be right
therefore it is from the many that I
would have you distinguish me, not because
it [be]comes from the favorite source but
because the Doctrine preached contains
within itself the consistent qualities of
Mercy and [of] faith.

May I ask your opinion of Mohamed Ali's means
& willingness to give us the required Translations 

2548   9157   You can place dependance in him so far
as facts are concerned , he will go from
you to the places whence these Antiquities
are brought and there ascertain the
Particulars concerning them., and if he
Pleases to do so bring them to you again
and if he does so he will do it correctly
but in all those things appertaining to a
higher life , holier things , if holier subjects
he knows no more than he did upon
Earth. , he only has opinions the same
as them.

I thank you   that accounts for his still believing
in Muhomets divine Mission.
[*52*]

[*2549 
9158*] I dont think that it accounts for that 
there are others besides him who look 
upon the prophet as one possessing the 
same powers and the same gifts as the 
writers of the bible.

I have for years entertained the opinion that he 
wrote the [?]. by Spiritual Aid - and [fancy?] [?] 
believed himself under a special divine Mission 
& my belief has of late been abundantly confirmed 
by what I have seen of Spirit writing mediums lips

[*2550 
9159*] He was undoubtedly under Spiritual 
Influence and some of his writings 
contain amongst much error great truths

Mohamed Ali has promised us the Translations 
Next Tuesday. I hope we shall not be disappointed

[*2551 
9160*] Was it on Tuesday next he promised? 
Refer to your book.

I read the passage & also mentioned that on the 
[?] Tuesday. I was to receive the CA's work.

[*2552 
9161*] I intended giving it you on that day 
but I think that he meant the Tuesday 
following the one he appeared on or he 
would have said this day fornight

I mentioned it because when you said 
Tuesday week. I put a different signifn. 
to the words in your book.

I do not know which he meant 
but it seemed to me unusual for any one 
to [the] name the time as you had 
understood him to do.

Can you let me know whether next Tuesday or any 
other day will suit him as Mr MacKenzie wishes 
to be here on that Evening

[*2553 
9162*] I cannot communicate with him this Evg 
because he has gone to the place from
[*53*]

whence the antiquities were brought.

May we be favored with another of those Spiritual 
Visions which interest us so much.

[*2554 
9163*] The Visions that I am able to show are 
of Scenes and places in the lower Spheres

The first sphere is filled with them for 
in that man, loses not his semblance of 
Mortality, therefore the being with whom 
he associates, and the thing which surround 
them. is in form as solid, though in Essence 
Aerial.

The Vision

3'

Now its veiled There's reading Coming

[*9166*] "The Council Chamber and the Pavilion 
of record at the Entrance of the 1st Sphere.

The front of the Mirror is a pavement of pure white 
Marble in squares connected together, right opposite 
theres some gates forming, most beautiful gates 
they look like open work of small Crystal bars, abt 
the size of a finger and in the Middle is something 
resembling a Coat of Arms. in gold work standing by 
itself. - its a Crown in the Middle, as usual  
[?] gold band with rough round looking pieces 
half burnished & half dim then [?] an Eagle on 
one Side and some Animal on the other, the Crown
[*54*]

is on two crosses the gates are most beautiful 
and the pillars are marble in the same shape 
as the former vision having six sides. Now the 
Gates are opening and just under theres some 
Steps downwards, the gates opened towards me.

Now I can see the bottom of the Steps it 
Names in patterns little {?} & purple half squares 
in Stars and diamonds - the Gate has come up 
this way. and I cant see the Steps - Now there 
are 8 pillars in a crescent between each a little 
further in there's arched doorways. on the ground 
between the pillars and the doorways the pavement 
is done beautiful in different colors, and patterns 
like flags on the stones. - its coming further this 
way, I am close up against the pillars, inside 
the arches there are rooms. between the tops of 
the arches and the tops of the pillars are covered in

12 past 10 Now I can see inside there appears like 
a white cloud spreading all over the place, theres 
Pictures all round each side - its one immense 
room. I cant see all the arches now. - Now the 
End this End is circular & the further end square 
the vapor comes out of Crystal & purple 
Shaped vases, the vases are fluted like 
the pillars purple and white and the Square 
Pedestal is white and the bottom of the vase 
Purple. - the vapor keeps going all over the 
room. there are other things besides the vases 
There is a round Canopy in the Middle with 
Steps to it, a very large one, 3 or 4 Steps and 
on the Top theres a dozen Seals and figures sitting 
in them some with their faces this way & some 
their backs and a table in the middle, they 
have wings, they are dressed in purple and
55

white, theres a great many books on the Table, 
not bound,  all white    they are handling them 
the Canopy is made of beautiful flowers & birds 
all white like Carving in Ivory, so beautiful such 
a deal of workmanship in it -
     The Carpet that covers the top step is of 
deep purple velvet and gold fringe, the Chairs 
seem like glass. Now they are all getting up, 
they are coming down the steps, theres 12 of them 
they are going to the square end of the room
and as they go near, the vases move nearer the
walls on each side
     Now the Middle of the end wall splits
down, and the pedestals and vases are gone quite
back and the walls spring asunder.  Theres a
bright light beyond it   Now it's opened wide
enough for them all to go through. --  Now theres
[a] throng of people as thick as they can be
[?] some all white, no wings, some in pink,
some blue.  and a great many children amongst
them.  on the other side of the people theres
another row of pillars  and out of them comes
something like a flat looking Glass.,  its like a
[book?] of looking glasses fastened to each pillar
each leaf a glass, and as the people go by I
can see their shadow on each of the glasses,  theres
4 pillars with the looking glasses and the 
people are passing 4 abreast.  as they go by
[their reflection?] seems to stop in the glass, and as
each passes the leaf turns over ready for the next
that passes -- its going -- its all gone --

As Lero is desirous to be dismissed you will
have. no trouble in doing so. , but before you
receive a higher spirit as a Companion to
your most secret thoughts. you must determ'e
in your own mind what your views and
your opinions are upon religious subjects.
You must have a definitely fixed belief
do not allow your mind to waver & doubt
And when you have fixed principles which
you can do after even an hours consideration
having weighed well all arguments that
have been brought before you, every point
that you may deem worthy of consideration
You must earnestly desire and pray to the
GOD that you believe in to send you if [you]
it be his pleasure one of His Ministering
Angels to guide you by faith to the same
knowledge that indeed passeth all understanding.
of His Truth and of the Truth of His Word
And you must ask for Enlightenment by
those means which you are most ready
to believe — that prayer will go home to
its source —
     Nothing Else Remains to be done

Reason for discharging him and then go to

True wisdom — 
     When you first inspect the mirror
after seeing Lero call your GS. and when
he appears ask him for his Seal. his
Name and his order —
     I should like him to appear
first in this Mirror for I am quite Certain
that no Evils approach this and I
will keep it from doing so then.

On Sunday Even'g last I visited Dr Hardinge  & heard
a very excellent religious Exordium lasting about an
hour & a half delivered by Mrs Hardinge as a Spirit
Medium in a Trance.  Is there any objection to
my taking my Seer to hear her.

2564   9174   There is no possible objection to hearing
the Communication but I should most
strongly advise any one not to allow
themselves to be made the medium for
such its Evil tendences morally & spiritually
are beyond Number.

If any &c

8.35 PM        C. A Mirror
             Invoked Mohamed Ali
                      No vision
Will the C A. inform me if MA will appear

9176   he will not
he has not returned

May I remark that it seems inexplicable to us. that a
spirit should have occasion to visit the material places
hence those antiquities were brought to enable him to
decipher them.

9177   Mohamed Ali is Spiritual, but he still
has personality and having such cannot
be separated.

[?].45.  Invoked Seven-o-Mina
SOM is here dressed in Pink - wings pink, bands

head - I can see his feet he has a ring on the

May I ask.  &c

Is it agreeable to you to answer some further q.s
upon the Subject of Astrology

9179    I am quite willing to answer you any
Questions within my Knowledge.

Your having a ring upon your hand is so novel to
us - May I without rudeness ask. what is Engraved
upon it.

9180    The Symbols of my Faith are in it

May I solicit You to show it to my Seer - but
not against Your wish

9181     It is not against my wish I am quite
willing to show it, but it is with all
reverence.

I thank you much, I will not press it.
H.D Lea
[*60*]

In placing Mr MacKenzies horoscope agt the Mirror 
may I ask the rule by which you proclaimed 
him a Spirit seer

[*9182*] I judged by the whole and by the time of birth 
and by the age, and from that I ascertained 
when the power would be developed, it is 
not from any particular sign, but from a 
Conjunction of different signs that a Spirit 
Seer may be known, because of the many 
that see there are scarcely two born at 
the time when one particular planet is 
in the Midheaven of their horoscopes.

Is the Moon in the 10h a Sign

[*9183*] No.

The System I ask upon is somewhat 
different from yours, for I see not the 
stars from the Earth, I am willing to 
show you my System.

We shall indeed be obliged.

[*9184*] I will give it you, that you may copy when 
it is convenient to you.

We shall be most happy to receive in on a future Evening 
unless it is convenient to you to give it to us on this

[*9185*] I cannot give it you in Words

I can appear any other Evening besides 
Tuesday - If the CA will allow the mirror 
to be used which I am sure he will.

May I ask your opinion of my friend Henry Lea's 
figure - which I now place agt the Mirror

[*9186*] He seems unfortunate in every thing 
he takes in hand, and his whole life goes 
on at the same pace. his fortune fluctuates 
but never rises much more than at present

Will he become a spirit seer

[*9187*] Never.
61
My friend Lea is desirous of Changing his GS.
and his present GS. also advises it to be done.    do you
also think it advisable

9188   I do-
Those circumstances which render him [?]
are all connected with money , or that desire
of his for creating more. — This may be
removed. — and with it much of his trouble
for when he receives from a better Spirit
much interest and knowledge., and a
right way of thinking on religious subjects
he will losers desire for worldly eminence
and consequently feel himself less unfortunate
Arise above Circumstances — and there are other
things that give me reason for believing he
would do well by the Change
     Lero is candid in admitting that
his power is limited , and it is more so
in the spirit world than when he appears
and talks to you of worldly matters
he cannot have the power of directing Your
spirit where he cannot go himself , he is
not able to mix with the highest orders of
Spirits , and cannot consequently teach
you their doctrines — or make you partakers
of their knowledge.

May I ask of you will kindly appear to my friends
Wife. When Called on Tuesday. next

9189   No answer

My friend Solicits a Response    Yes or No

9190   I would appear if some alteration was
made in his mode of using his mirror

Will you favor him now With your advice

9191   he should use the exorcism after Lero
has departed. 3 times for Lero is neither

high or powerful and therefore his presence
does not prevent others from coming in

Mr MacKenzie is desirous of asking some questions
in respect to Miss A  and her spiritual investig'ns

9192    I will answer them.

Mr M here left his seat to hold the Seers hand when Seven O Mina
observed / 

9193     I can answer them as well if you remain 
seated - it is more convenient to you.

May I ask how you were able to give me such    [*KM*]
exact information respecting miss A.  although
you say that you cannot appear to her?

9194   I can see without being seen, be [?] & seek
information respecting any one without being
visible either to the sight or feelings.
On a former occasion you promised to communic'e   [*KM*]
with my GSs respecting the means of inducing
Miss A. to give the preference to the C. or M. conv'ns
with the S. W.  May I ask if you have done so?

9195   I have done so with "accumulation" & "Courage"
and they have promised to do all they can
but Miss A is so surrounded with all
kinds of spirits  and they use  such
conflicting and such opposing influences
over her.  that she is not free.   her mind
is never unbiassed  and I am afraid
that the results may be serious,  but
still if your G S.  could create a doubt
in her mind  as to hers being the right
mode of proceeding,  that doubt might
 be strengthened  by circumstances and her
will exerted in opposition to over come
them.

You have by your reply almost anticipated    [*KM*]
my next question.  I will however still 
submit it for your kind opinion.  It was
[*_______________  dont go below this*]

another order have the same effect as Constantine 
had I mesmerize Miss A!
[*63*]

as to the arrangement which I should more 
specially use at Mr Crosland's?

[*9196*] I shall be very  glad to give you advice I 
am sure that when you go to Mr Croslands 
house it is with a desire to obtain such 
as may not only be to your own advantage 
but to the welfare of those giving & receiving 
with this feeling on entering his house 
inwardly pray that all evil may go 
from it - and that whatever Spiritual 
Communication may take place that 
Evening none may come. through visible 
or tangible Evidence to your senses. that 
you may not feel but be convinced of 
the Truth. and then when you give her 
the Crystal previously discharged call a 
Spirit who is not of the order generally 
seen at that house. - Call one that 
you have faith in. And ask him before 
Miss A. his opinion of the Effects upon 
her of the Spirits she holds Communion 
with. - I wish you could take this 
Mirror there.

I explained that his wish relating to the Mirror 
could not be carried out.

[*9197*] Then you can use the Crystal.

I may observe that on most if not on all 
occasions I have used prayer on entering Mr Cs 
that Miss A cannot be mesmerized in my presence 
nor are the raps so frequent. Would not a spirit of

[*9198*] Call Constantine again I do not think 
he would then Mesmerize her.

Spirit came into the C and gave her name 
as Prayer. Do you know such a Spirit of

order of intelligences.
64

world and suggests prayer by all its power
to men. , and that it takes  its name from
its desire of influencing him in that way

I  the same evening enquired if Mr. W. would see & rec'd  [*KM*]
a reply in the affirmative.  I also received a
response respecting white & black mirrors which
[I] will read & beg your opinion !  /see opposite

9200   There is nothing objectionable in that, it is
quite right, Angels of light will not come
into contact with darkness.

I ment'd that the C. A. directed a black mirror to be  [*KM*]
made for me & rec'd the following response.  "Mr. W.
seeks the manifestations with other views & to establish
other principles."  I differ from this.  May I ask your
view?

9201   I think you rather mistake -- The Black
Mirror was recommended to you for the
purpose  of developing the faculty
previous to your using the white one
because the eyes  when first opened to the
spiritual light are not sufficiently strong
to bear the great light that attends spirits
who are radiant.
     Mr Woods desire was to obtain the
information of good Spirits -- Your the Sight.

A long response was given respecting the use of   [*KM*]
writing mediumship and its nature differing 
from the views expressed by the C. A and yourself
May I ask for some information from you
upon the subject?

9202   I think the C or M or Vessel of Water is the
best means of communicating with spirits
and I think that any means by which
they can manifest themselves to the senses
of man are Evil
     Invocation by the C is also best because
all those who appear in it appear as

65

individuals they have a separate person
each cannot take the form of the others
and by their separate form they can be
known again.  Whereas if you have the
influence without [the] seeing the S you
know not from whence it proceeds whether
it be the power of one alone exerted or
mixed good and evil  or whether one may
come and another go  whilst you are still
believing them to be the same,  and you
are aware that when they appear there is
an unmistakeable difference between the
good and the evil

As a writing medium Mr. W's hand continually wrote   [*KM*]
communications calling him the Son of Swedenborg.
 At Mr C's I was told that this was "because
[?] wished to make him his spiritual son -- to make
him the medium of a revelation to mankind"
I differ from this.

9203    It is wrong, Swedenborg himself had not
a divine mission, he is now convinced 
of much error in his life and writings and
were his spirit to come back  it would least
of all desire that another should follow [it]
in his footsteps,  perhaps this might
partly have arisen from the ideas then
occupying Mr Woods mind  his particular
views on religion may teach him to believe
that those ordained to the Church, have
all a mission among men.  and that 
they are ministers either of Christ or of
other powers who they acknowledge for
66

guiding and ruling power
     The thoughts of those writing have
much to do with the information given
whereas in the Crystal the spirit appearing
is perfectly distinct and separate from the
mind  that receives its responses.

From many circumstances trivial perhaps in                    [*KM*]
themselves but having great weight when taken
together I am led to considerable suspicion respecting
my GSs & am wishful to change.  May 
I ask your opinion -- the C. A has already expressed
his.

9204    When you say that you have distrust, you give
evidence that it is necessary, perfect union
must be established before any thing like
harmony between Guardian & Charge can be
established -- to do this you must have
for that Guardian one that you can rely 
upon, one in whose careful hands you can
respose the interests of your soul. -- the
very doubt shows the necessity.
     If you should desire it and after 
a time during which you have investigated
as far as possible the value of the Commun'ns
that I may give you -- when you have
called others in the Crystal and have had
the advice of others that you can rely
on in the M  and have found from
them that I am good and true  and as
powerful as my class.  and when you have
received from me a consistency of words
that may leave no doubt upon your
mind as to my goodness. -- if you 
desire it -- then -- I am willing & should
be much please to become your Guardian
67

Spirit - I do not for a moment press 
it, I do not desire it further than for 
your interest, but I feel that there is 
Sympathy betwixt us, that we have 
liking in Common, and that you are 
one in whom I should be able to take 
that interest which I cannot desire to 
do in all.
     I do not wish you to answer 
me now but to consider it, and above 
all I do not wish you to do so, unless 
you believe from Conviction that it would 
be for your good.

Mr M. returned thanks.

9205     do not do so without Consideration

The C. A is here with a book. in his hand.
Before receiving your promised favor may I ask 
a question.

2566    9206    do so. I have myself a remark to make

My unfortunately mistaking Mohamed Ali's 
appointment, will prevent my seeing him on a 
Tuesday Ev'g.  will you inform me on what other 
Evening it will be agreeable to him to appear

2567   9207    If you will call Mohamed Ali this 
Evening when I have left he will appear, and then you 
can ask him  there is no objection to 
you seeing him on any other Evening

do you mean before or after receiving the Contents of the
68
Book.

2568   9208   After you have finished with the book.

On the Evening M A Consents to appear, I should also
Prefer Calling Sevenomina & Eltasmo.  if I have your
permission

2569   9209   I have a request to make for Sevenomina
He desired me to ask you to favor him
by appointing an Evening on which he may
appear in the presence of Mr MacKenzie
as it is desirable that his GSS should be
changed, it is necessary that he should
have the means of Communicating with one
of a high order., that he might be convinced
that the Change was for his benefit -
being unable at present to see himself
he cannot Communicate with Sevenomina
or any others of his order. so that if
you could devote an Evening to him
and the Calling of one or more Spirits
besides, it would not interfere with
your own Evening which is Tuesday.

I will at your wish devote next Friday.

2570   9210   Sevenomina leaves the day to you
he will appear on any Evening when most
convenient - If Mr M can come on Friday
Shall I tell him it is fixed.

do so Mr M will I know make a point of being
here. & I will postpone any other engagements.

2571   9211   We must again ask Mr Lea if his mind
is more decided as to changing his GS.
if so I shall be pleased to do all I can
to aid in putting him in the way of
procuring a better one.

If any &c.

in pursuance of your expressed wish Mr Mackenzie is
here this Evening  prior to his asking any questions may
I ask if you have any observation or remark to favor us
with first.

9217    I desired an interview that we might know
more of each other,  and if the spirit within
him harmonized with me, that we might
become united, I would willingly answer
any questions that he may lay before me.
and give him the benefit of my knowledge
of those things in the spirit world with
which he is of Course unacquainted
     I desired an evening to be devoted to
his Investigation that he might call others
as well as myself, and be able to judge
between them and act as his own will
may dictate.

Is it necessary that when proposing his questions
Mr. M should take hold of my Seer'es hand

9218    There is no necessity for it.

Mr M explained that on the previous ☉die Evening he had   [*KM*]
[?] Mr C's  had used as advised the Ex'm which at
[?] had the desired effect, to him , but that the party
present sat down to the table expressly to receive the
[rapping?] comm'ns & the Ex'm did not prevent that [?]
Communication

9219    You entirely succeeded in Keeping their
influence from yourself and would have
done so from others present -- had they 
not overruled your will by their own
--  I meant the exorcism would be perfectly
successful if the others present did not
act in direct opposition to it by actually
calling the spirits you dismissed --  had
they remained passive however convinced

71

in their minds of those Spirits goodness
Your exorcism would have been effectual

Mr M. remarked that he Called "Courage" & Miss A described    [*KM*]
him — but his Appearance (A ) [so] entirely differed from 
his appearance in this Mirror & his responses were contradictory
to the facts elicited when he appeared in this M

9220     Each spirit has a personalty that cannot
be mistaken — their clothing may appear
different , it does so in nearly all cases at
different times but they come with the
same motto. and have always the same
Appearance
     Courage is one of that class who try
rather to make impressions upon you
through outward appearances , than through
instruction to the mind , and one of those
who attach themselves and devote their
attention to a particular faculty or attribute
of the body , rather than the interests of
the spiritual being , and as you have difft.
faculties and different attributes each so
various in their Nature — so you are compelled
to have so many separate guardians this
is quite unnecessary. , when the soul is looked
to before the body —  And the Spirits of which
Courage & Mystery and accumulation belong
to are those who adhere to you because you
have those qualities within you which they
most particularly esteem which they wish
to invigorate and Strengthen. and in
becoming your attendants they study their
own desires rather than your interests.

When the Spirit "Courage" appeared ☉die I asked him
these questions & received his responses — if I place them
against the mirror will you favor me with your
72

opinion thereon & as I will place each sheet separately
will you inform me when you have ascert'd the Contents
Mr. M placed the leaves separately ag't the mirror which
Sevenomina perused & at the end of the first sheet -- said

9221    Now

Mr M placed the 2nd which he perused & said                         [*KM*]

9222    Now

Mr M did the same with the third when SOM said                   [*KM*]

9223     In what state was Miss Andrews when
these communications took place.

Apparently in her normal state, but at the time I                     [*KM*]
thought she was in a self somnambulic state

9224     I have done with it

Mr M then placed the 4?                                                                [*KM*]

9225     That will do
I think she must have been under the
influence of an internal power, for altho'
Amager's not a powerful spirit, he is a
good one and I cannot think,  it was the
same that appeared to Miss Andrews
Neither can I tell what spirit it was when
so many of different classes & different
orders  good and Evil  are allowed to take
possession of not only the room  and the
things it contains  but of the parties
present themselves  it is impossible to tell
under what influence the answers are given
or what amount of reliance can be placed 
upon them.
     When good & Evil spirits act in opp'n
the medium is torn to pieces by the conflict
and it may act in this way
     A medium may be inspecting a Crystal
well Charged and a good spirit may appear
that has withstood strong exorcism, another
73
spirit and that one evil may enter the body
this is supposing the medium to have
been in the habit of Communicating with rapping
spirits is desirous of so doing -- The spirit
that takes possession of the body is desirous
of over riding the one that appears -- the one
presents himself to the mind without
influencing or controlling it. the other takes
possession and by his power, makes her
without her being aware of it afterwards
clairvoyant -- having done so, he can use
her as he pleases.  make her read something
quite differently from that which appears
and yet allow her to deceive others by
keeping the vision of the spirit before her
Eyes   that appears in the Crystal.
In fact whenever the possession of a person
is given up to spirits they are no longer
safe for they have unlimited control
of the party themselves   do not resist

In this long response I presume you have [*KM*]
included all the reflections that
have passed through my mind during
its delivery. At least it seems so to 
me.

9226   I  gave my own opinion upon the minutes
that you plead before me, I am not desirous
I would not do it, of entering into your
mind yet -- not until you have determined
whether it is best for your spiritual wlfare
that I should become your protector now
a protector of your souls interest -- the leader
of that soul in a future state and the companion
or rather the united existence with it in Eternity
* cont'n of response.
make both me and you instrumental to His Will and that I
Knowing more of His Grace may be able better to lead you
in the straight but narrow path that leads to His Glory
and His Throne, and our Union Commencing with the
favor of His Countenance who can say that it shall end
other than by His Will
74
that I would be one with your mind at
intervals now 

May I ask if the GSS appointed to me are not  [*KM*]
already dismissed by my sympathy with
you. Your own desire to see me evinces y'r
interest in me . I accept with eagerness y'r
goodness having carefully weighed it & would
beg for the proper instructions to promote our
union.

9227   Then the means of so doing are open to you
You must dismiss Courage & mystery and
Accumulation, thanking them for the services
they may have rendered you and then pray
from but the wishes of your heart to Him
who is ever ready to heed that which is
earnestly asked  Pray for protection and
guidance and that it may so please him
to teach the servant you have chosen if she
thinks that choice fit -- to be the instrument
through which his ways may be made
known to you . Pray that He may make (*see opposite)

Pray understand that I do not feel in any  [*KM*]
way vexed with them. but my feelings are
with you. How shall I discharge & when
How shall I know they are discharged?

9228   You discharge them from yourself by simply
desiring them to leave you, and attach
themselves to another object whom they might
elevate by so doing   that is if they were to
take the charge of a person, that has been
under the guidance of much lower spirits
they would be raising him by their protection
and doing a good deed , they will be easily
dismissed for when the sympathy is broken
between guardian & Charge both are made
in a measure distrustful
75 
May I in that case beg for your Seal that I might wear it

Miss E Leigh then made a drawing & I asked if a Copy 
of it would be sufficiently correct for Mr M. to make his

9232   Yes if it is done better

Am I to wear this in conjunction or with                              [*KM*]

9233   It would be best to wear them both, the one 
you have made is only for the purpose of 
enabling you to see - the Invisible made

The Eye the watchfulness of Providence 
The Cross by which He is attracted to Man
     That is the belief in Jesus Christ dwelling 
     in the human heart calls down His

     the means by which he descends unto 
     his believers.

to the knowledge of this Being, They are open
to all who will avail themselves
The one on the right hand is through the
     means of Spiritualism
The one on the left through the Miracles of
     the roman Church. and through the means
     of the mother of Jesus Christ —
These are the two ladders that ascend
There is one that descends  it is sin
The powers of Evil are Confined within the half
     Circle at the bottom of the Earth.
Where the Triangle & 3 forks are represent
Water and fire then especial Elements.
and is at the same time one of the Signs
which they cannot overcome — the sign
that contains the Power to subdue them.
     The Seven lines above the Earth are the
boundaries of the Seven Spheres. and thro'
these the knowledge of man may pass.

[*KM*]  May I ask if you take your Guardianship from this  [*KM*]
time or at what other time —

9234    From the Moment that you Join me in
Prayer that it may be so

I have this day ent'd my 24th year — & as I earnestly wish [*KM*]
[?] avail myself of Your protection |DV| If I call
my late GSs & thanking them for their past favors
will that be sufficient to dismiss them

9235   It would

Then with your permission  I will [?] Mr Hockley to  [*KM*]

[?] request your reappearance.

9231   You can do so if yo wish

Which shall H call  or will all 3 appear at once

9237    They will not all three appear together  it w'd.
be sufficient to call Courage.

questions & responses. which I received through Miss
Andrews which purported to be delivered by You.

9246    I did not answer my questions at all
I appeared and finding that my presence
was over ruled by other influences I retired

Are you aware that I contemplate changing my                 "
GS. for one of a higher order

9249     I have thought that you might do so

Is it in your opinion fit and proper for me so to                  "
do. 

9250    It is

Then I do not in any way anger or displease you                "
In the Act  I am about to do.

9257     You do not and I think you will benefit
by the Change.

Then I presume you are acquainted with                           [*KM*]
Sevenomina?

9252     I know the class to which he belongs, and
that one is sufficient to be the guardian
because he is more powerful than three
or even 4 of us.  And I think that when
you are under the Control of one. there can
be no division, for spirits of the same
order can disagree unless that order be
of the very highest — and when Spirits war
who shall agree. And when the members of
the body are divided against themselves, is it
not likely that the whole structure may
fall — if a man have 3 Guardian Spirits
and those 3 are not in perfect harmony
one with the other   I believe him to be the
sufferer for in him their Conflicting opinions
meet so that I am certain it is best when
79

You feel reliance on the truth and goodness 
of one. to keep solely unto him.

Are you aware that this being the Anniversary of my       [*KM*]
birth I think it a fitting opportunity, to thank you 
for your Guardianship so far as it has existed & to req't 
you will be kind enough to convey my thanks to 
[Cour] Mystery & Accumulation - & let me beg you not 
to consider my doing so as any disrespect to you. 

[*9253*] I receive it as it is meant 
I may do the good for others which I 
have no longer the means of doing to you.

Will you also convey my thanks to M. and A. and 
when I see myself. I hope to thank them personally 
may I ask if you now consider your guardianship 
ended.

[*9254*] I do, and if there is any advice at any 
time that we can give you. I trust that 
you will receive it none the less. because 
we are discharged, I am sure that they 
with me will ever be ready to aid you 
in your investigations as for as our power 
will permit.
     before leaving I will give you a final 
warning as to allowing or encouraging rapping 
or writing or any Spirits that manifest 
themselves through matter. at Mr Croslands.

You say Seven o mina is not of your class of spirit 
[is?] he not as well as you of the same order

[*9255*] He is of the same order, but one order is 
divided into many classes, each rising one 
above the other from the lowest to the highest 
of the same order. we are both of the A A

Will you permit me to reiterate my thanks &c

[*9256*] I wish you well

Sevenomina, as soon as you left Mr H called Courage, he
says he appeared in Odie but [?] himself over Ruled
he left—as directed I utd him my thanks for his [Gship]
will you allow me to ask you some questions as to
my communications in future with you.
9257
Yes.
If you havE made the seal for the developmt
of your Spiritual sight , it will materially
and in developing the faculty but you
cannot hope to be in the full possession
of it such before your 25th year. until
that time you must be satisfied that I am
watching for you progress and doing all
that is permissible to further it — I trust
taht I shall be allowEd to appear in this
mirror again to Communicate with you.
It is a pleasure to do so without any [?]
influence at work. for the Truth  commanding
dignity of the CA. allows nothing but purity
to approach. his means of discoursing
with his Charge.
I shall be always happy to appear
in any Friday that it may be convEnient
and in return for this [???lege] I am most
willing to givE Mr Hockley any information
or opinion that he may decide from me
for the furtherance of this knowledge.
I ExplainEd. and asked if so soon as I had made the
Black Mirror he wd. appear therein — protect it , and
[?] any Evil influences appearing therein.
9258
I will I do not wish to be called at Mr
[??slands].
81
KM
I beg to say I should not think of doing so, I will
Endeaver to prevail upon Miss A. to alter her
present mode of Communicating with spirits
9259
There is no objection to your going there but
I should most strongly advise you to havE
nothing to do with the spirits that
manifest themselves, keep yourself free
and they cannot harm you exercise
your will in resistance to them and that
will make you free.
You can then hear all that takes
place without being influenced
You mentioned that you would favor us with your
method of Astrology. May I ask if we can recivE it
to night or will it take too long a time —
9260
I will givE it you in the form of a book
that may be copied but there is not time
this EvEning.
If I make an appointment with the CA will that be
sufficient
F.H
9261
It will.
KM
My mother has taken great interest in this subject may
I ask if you will visit her at B— & ascertain if her
Sight can be developed.
9262
I can tell you now that she will not
feeling sympathy with you I havE glanced
over those with whom you Associate.
"
As to the [?] you have already given me
may I ask whether I shall not be influenced
by the [?] of it?
9263
You do not come into Communication with them
they are not to be in any way Connected
with you only with the means by which
you see all things Spiritual.
[*82*]

May I ask if it be permissible to ask of the heavenly 
Angels & GSs. the result of things earthly & personal 
to oneself. [*KM*]

[*9264*] There is no objection to your asking but the 
higher the spirit the more limited their 
knowledge of the circumstances taking place 
among men.

They cannot enter sufficiently into their 
actions. I am not able to answer the 
questions relative to your interest, until 
I actually become your GS. I can tell 
you that the next time that I appear.

I conclude from your reply that you understand 
to what I refer [*KM*]

[*9265*] I know of much that belongs to you 
not all.

From the singular manner in which I made 
the acquaintance of Mr Stockley may I ask 
whether it was not the effect of some direction 
in my nativity? [*KM*]

[*9266*] It may have been doomed by the position of the 
planets but it was not caused by them. 
it may have been foretold by any means but 
it was not a meeting of chance, one thing 
must bring about another, every thing in mans 
life is connected. and the events that follow 
each other in succession from his birth to his 
death. are the working out of a plan that 
cannot be altered even by himself unless he 
can. substitute that which his Judgment 
tells him will be more conducive for his 
happiness, than the one that he throws out 
if he changes his destiny it is by an effort of 
his reason.

So to Mr [?]. coming to Croydon one evening
[*83*]

[*9267*] It would not be well for him so to do.

I will therefore take your advice and not mention the 
Subject to him again [*KM*]

[*9268*] I have a great objection and so have all other 
Spirits to appear to those, who say that 
they are open to Conviction, wish for some 
positive proof. at first starting of over 
existence, and who not obtaining it, will 
either be averse and denounce the whole 
- or else ridicule it -

Mr M. ret thanks.

I mentd. my regret at having mistaken Mohamed 
Ali's appointment & hoped he wd fix an Evening to give 
me the translation of the plates he took with him

[*2574 
9269*] He is a strange Spirit 
I cannot make him appear or say when 
he will do so.

Could you oblige me by asking him when he will appear

[*2575 
9270*] I did ask him last Tuesday Evening and 
he made me understand he did not intend 
appearing then.

Could you not ask him to make an apptt

[*2576 
9271*] I will ask him

When shall I know his decision, or will you ask him 
to appear after I have received the book[s].

[*2577 
9272*] Yes if he will appear himself he will do 
so then. If not I will return and give 
you his answer.

On Friday Evening we had an interview ith
84
with Sevenomina & strangely enough it has
resulted in Sevenomina becoming the GS of Ms Mackenzie

2578
9273
Why does it appear strange you cannot
think that these things happen by accident

A long time since we were in the course of receiving the
Magical & other Mf works relating to [?ph] [Balsamo?]
the press of other subjects has hindered our continuing
them. may I hope to resume them on a future Evg.

2579
9274
You can communicate with spirits any Friday
Evening between this and the 2nd Tuesday
in January

I do not wish to appear Selfish, but as I wish to devote
Tuesdays entirely to your communications I will
occasionally call on [symbol for Venus] dies - other spirits, the more so
as on those Eves. I can enable Sevenomina & Dr M to 
Commate with each other

2580
9275
do so, any or every Friday Evening you
will be able to do so.

If may &c.

2581

I have not this Evening except that if
You would like to make an appointment
with Ellesmo for next Friday Evening I
would give you his Answer. when I return

2583
9278
I am sorry that it looks indistinct for
I made it as plain as possible, if you
cannot see to read it this evening I will
give you the Continuation of it on Friday
as well as next Tuesday.

I thank you much. has [M A] made an appt't

2584

he said that he w'd appear himself when
you inspected on Friday Evening next.

Then I must defer receiving the book till next Tuesday

2585
9280
It is the same.

As my Seer cannot read this Evening will you
kindly favor us with a vision.
Now hes gone
10' past 8 PM

9281  The vision
1/4 past. Now its thick theres the outline of a figure flying along
it appears flying from me - yet it does not get smaller
its the space coming this way. The wings very pale
pink and the dress white no band round the waist
the dress covers the feet, long black curly hair, as
it is going from me I do not see the face. as far as I
can see the top of the Mirror looks round & very
purplish the air seems milkey white under him
and gradually gets a blueish shade then darker
then purple & at the top a bright purple, now a
long way off theres a little spot of light like bright
gold, its getting longer, its a little round ball
as large as a [4d?] piece, it looks like the Sun a bright
Yellow light; it makes my Eyes ache to look at it.
The light seems approaching this way & the angel
is [left] flying towards it but very slowly theres holes
all over the light as thick as possible, its nearly all
holes, and the light seems to come through the holes
& throw pointed rays. - now its as large as the
middle of a Cheeseplate & keeps getting larger but 
its so bright it make my Eyes ache.  & as that
gets larger & the spirit nearer, the spirit gets smaller
it looks now such a little thing - now its a large ball
of light and the holes as large as a shilling & as close
as they can possible be -- Now the spirit is there  he
is going in at one of the holes,  hes gone quite in &
the hole entered at is getting closer & quite large &
coming towards me but the light is painfully dazzling
     I can see thro the [w]hole  a number of things
so small it is very light inside  I cannot make them
out.  Now the inside looks like a half-round the top
of the inside is blue and the bottom is square &
solid [Illustration here]  it looks like sponge more than any
thing else  full of holes & the Color of sponge
its got larger and I can see further,  the
bottom makes a flat surface and theres people
walking about theres 3 or 4 little heaps like little
tunnels above ground very close down on the ground
made of wooden hoops and covered over with the
spongy stuff & theres a passage runs right thro'
theres 5 of them about and something like thick
water runs down through the holes in streams
     The people are curious looking they are
very small and have high white caps on twice
as long as their heads. --

My Seer Complained so much of her Eyes & the figures
becoming confused & blended together  We ceased

Spirits are becoming associated. I trust that 
they will become more so. I would do all 
in my power to make them better acquaint'd.

1st apparition 
7 nov. 1856
3' to 8 P.M
87
Are you aware of the doctrines [derived?], from the New
Testament which are generally believed by professing
Christians -.

9286
I am, and it may be said to contain the
Security of our welfare, for by acknowledgmt.
of its existence, and a belief in its contents
and faith in the object for which it was
written we retain our position, were we
to cease doing so in any [way] degree we
degenerate and fall from our high
estate.

I hold in my hands & now place agt the Mirror the
whole of the words of our Lord Contained in the New Tt.
may I ask your belief & views as to this divine Concept?
[Asn] Mission & the doctrine of the redemption of
ManKind by his death upon the Cross.

9287
That he was the Spirit of GoD, born into
the flesh. I acknowledge but I cannot
conceive how the two states could have
become united.
I know that all things are possible
and I can comprehend the why but I
cannot the how.
His divine Mission is made evident in
his life and his death was indeed necessary
to bring repentant sinners before an offended
but still merciful Judge. as the mediator
his power must have been great for
partaking half of the divinity and half
of Man. he was able in his own nature
to bring one in subjection to the other.
I do not consider his death upon
the Cross so much a sacrifice as a means
of destroying and leaving behind the body
that was no longer useful, I cannot
88

9287
but think that a natural death would
have effected the same purpose, it seems
to me that it was only necessary for the
Spirit to return when the Needed teaching
was given to Men, when the instrument
was left upon Earth. which should
afterwards lead him to GOD.

May I ask your view of the doctrine of Christ being
the only mediator & intercessor between GOD & Man.
held by dissenting Catholics in opposition to the Views
of the Roman Catholics

9288
I believe him to be the first and greatest
Mediator, and the only one that will
avail those who know of his existance
for to know of him, and to pray through
other means unless you direct your
prayers at once to the most High, is Sin-
great Sin - but I still think that
the Mother of Christ, must have a place
Near him and must have influence
and if asked earnestly to exert it by the
Many. who can believe from their religs.
connections in none but her, she is able
to do so.

May I ask, how it is that Spirits of the same AA
order differ in their views as to the doctrines of
Professing Christians

9289
In one order there are many Classes
in each of these the spirits go through
a separate state of knowledge -
In the AA order there are 5 degrees
When it is entered by a spirit of an
inferior state the knowledge is not near
so perfect as when they attain the 5th Class
so as they rise they have additions made
89
to their knowledge when they are not certain 
of facts, they form conjectures from grounds
that seem to them the most reasonable, of
things, that are certain and no longer doubtful
to those a step beyond them, and as
conjecture it is not without [?].
     It is not until after the Consummation 
of all things that any spiritual body can
attain perfect knowledge, for as in [every and]
either and every stage he is a body of 
Truth - the attainment of perfect knowledge
must make him infallible --

May I ask, if permissible, the meaning of the letters
A A as intended to be conveyed to us mortals.

9290   I will try and make myself understood
What you call A. is not a letter of the
Alphabet, but a Character -- one large and
alone signifies the greatest power, the
greatest good, the Source of all greatness
It is expressive of the Characters of GOD
     Another of the same attached to it
signifies to us dependants, messengers
attaches - & if I may so express it the
same that man means by the word
GOD and then Godliness --
and the I (capital i) when above the two AA's signifies
to us a nearer conjunction of the the two.
/sic/ [that is the spirit is more closely allied]
that the second great A is more nearly
allied to the first greater one than he
is to those beings to which he is attached
those who possess the two AA's alone
are directly between.

Supreme Angels of the AA order are not to be confounded
with the Angels of the various spheres forming the Seven
9292 the nature of atmospheric spirit
9293
[*90*]

or related to this Earth

[*9291*] They are not each Sphere has its order 
of Spirits and the orders are divided into 
different degrees. and in each separate 
Sphere, even the one next the Earth there 
is as much difference between the members 
of one order as there is in the professions 
of Men and the distinctions between them 
in the same profession.

May I ask by what letters or Characters the Spirits 
of the first Sphere are distinguished

[*9292*] The Spirits of the atmosphere being first 
The atmosphere may be said to be occupied 
by all classes for the highest spirits cannot 
come upon the earth without descending 
through it, and the lowest that wander 
on its surface have their place in it

But those forms that pervade it and

they are but forms, records of mens actions 
what he does in a moment. is kept 
there present until it is blotted out. by 
his own repentance, or his own goodness 
and the good actions are in the same 
way kept. or how should they be produced 
at the time needed.

I do not call that a Spirit which 
is not a body of intelligence which is 
not a responsible being acting on its own 
impulse - so that I cannot call 
them spirits, when they are but the double 
of Man. they are but the shadowing 
upwards of his life

We have on Earth a process culled from the [?]

books, as myself - my seers double. Mr Andersons

to bear upon a Chemically prepared surface & by
means of a lens all the surrounding objects are depicted
upon it with most minute accuracy.  I can therefore
easily conceive that our actions may be, reflected
into Space as the [?] the mirage &c  &c.  but I
cannot conceive how those * forms appear to us in our
Mirrors & Crystals as mine & others have Continually done
under Circumstances - & associations - & holding arguments
directly opposed to my own Views --

9293   These forms are not the actions of Men
daguerreotyped,  they remain a separate
body from him in his form and out of
their place they are not the same beings
as in it --
     I am perfectly aware that they are
able to leave their abode but I am not
acquainted with their manner when away
it may be that they are no longer, a
double-self and if so what they may do
and say out of their place is of no account
neither is it of any harm.,  they may tell
you right, they may tell you wrong but
as they are not responsible they are not 
to be credited

May I ask the Character by which the Spirits of the
1st Sphere are distinguished and the number of ther classes

9294   Every order is divided into 5 classes.
Every sphere contains one order

have they a Character by which they are known

9295   Only the first letters of the sphere.

Is there any Chief Spirit who presides over the 1st Sphere

[*93*]

[*9300*] I shall be very pleased to appear and I may 
now mention (I will not detain you long) 
that there exists throughout the Spheres 
I traverse, many tokens of the nature 
of different Spirits, many of the works of 
Spirits, some on one thing and some on 
another. each gives his attention to a 
particular Subject. and among them are 
many things that I firmly believe it 
would be well were they brought and shown 
to living people. - for the writing of one 
individual Spirit illustrates a [?] 
or an object, to which he may have devoted 
his attention and his scrutiny, for a 
length of time, more than the passing 
knowledge of many who have not 
enquired so deeply into each subject.

If you desire any of these works that 
you might read, or copy them it is 
permissible that I should show them 
and I would do so as far as my power 
would allow at a future time.

I thank you much. Your offer opens a new field for 
research, may I ask the nature or Titles of the Works

[*9301*] Some of the Spirits of the first Sphere 
devote themselves in obtaining plans and 
drawings of the places, and of those with 
whom they associate, of their mode of 
life, that they may improve themselves for 
a higher Sphere and also that they may 
show them to those in the Atmosphere 
for their benefit.

Others collect their knowledge in a way 
you call a book not written, but gathered 
together and able to be expressed.

Invoked Seven-o-mina

immediately - he is here as before.

Can you tell me why Mohamed Ali left so suddenly

[*9305*] I know Mohamed Ali, I do not think 
it strange, his usual behaviour is quite 
as abrupt. I like his knowledge, and 
his learning, but I do not like his 
Manners. therefore I do not communicate 
with him -

May I ask if it is convenient for you to give me a portion
[*95*]

of your promised work on Astrology this Evening

[*9306*] I promised to give it in M Mackenzies 
presence.

Allow me at once to state, that I should not have called 
you or the guardian Spirit of any other friend 
without their being present, but there are circumstances 
which prevent my having the pleasure of Mr M's Company 
so often as I could wish, and as when we receive your 
promised work, Mr M if present could not ask any 
questions, I thought I would get you to give me the work 
at an opportunity like the present, as I should be bound 
in honor to let him copy it - I did not for a moment 
ask it for my own purposes alone.

[*9307*] I understand you, it was not that I 
declined given it to you, I am quite 
willing to appear at any time you 
might call me for your own purposes

I thank you I hope soon to have the pleasure of 
seeing Mr M. here & will then devote the Evening to 
you and him -

I will avail myself of your kind offer and will now 
ask a question, for my private purposes.

Are you aware &c of the [Palingenena?]

[*9308*] I am.

Will you favor me with your views. of the mode by 
which it is performed.

[*9309*] I will give it you but are you aware it is 
by the power of Evil Spirits - 
You will not use it.

I explained the theory of the Antients [of] Alchemists 
on the Subject & also as to the Magical Way.

[*9310*] There are two way of doing it 
There is a simple way which I am not 
perfectly acquainted with. and there is 
a method which applies to every thing
The palingenesia of plants.

If a fish the same process

[*9316*] Yes. - It is while the flame lasts that 
the lifes revived, apparently, it is not 
really the case

Are you aware of the, Skeleton [?] Spell.

[*9317*] I am

Are you aware by what means so singular an effect 
takes place.

[*9318*] Through the means of the Spirits of Fire 
you must be aware that when doing it you 
are want only injuring another - you are 
destroying his free will and doing what 
may result in he loss of his life.

This is unlawful and an Evil 
purpose and when you consign to the 
flames a token of your desire, no matter 
whether it be one thing or another - You 
place yourself by your desire in a relationship 
to the Spirits of fire, they fulfill your 
wishes, when the time of payments comes 
you have to fulfill theirs.

You must be aware that it is not a 
Natural act, it dispatches a will to a 
distant object no accountable law can do 
it - Something unseen and beyond the 
Control of Man must execute his Commands

That which is unseen & beyond your 
Control is Spiritual, and of the nature of that 
unseen power with which you Communicate 
you can tell only by the desires, and the 
means for which you wish to employ
[*98*]

If they be good with a tendency to Charity 
towards men. and fear towards GOD then 
the Spirits are as pure as the motives.

But we mortals have the power of compelling other 
mortals to think, act & talk. as we will them 
to do. - & yet a simple thing in iself.

[*9319*] That is electro-biology, and that is not 
so very simple, for while you exert your 
will you annihilate theirs, and you 
cannot do this unless you are present 
with a party -

The other spell taking Effect when the 
parties are miles apart.

By what means is the mind so fixed

[*9320*] It is concentrating the will to one object 
You cannot do it unless your eye meets 
theirs and then the strength of your 
whole being you must desire - you shall -

Do you know why Mohamed Ali has not appeared 

[*9321*] I do not

Mr Mackenzie is now present is it necessary that 
he should law hold of my Seers hand when he 
proposes his questions

[*9322*] he can ask them in his present place
[*99*]

As I have not invoked on a Sunday for the last 
2 years may I ask how long you can favor us with 
your presence this Evening

[*9323*] I can remain for some time but as I was 
aware Mr Mackenzie was coming here this 
Evening and that I should appear & stay 
only to a quarter to nine I have to ask 
you on behalf of another Spirit if you 
will receive him when I leave. he seems 
to wish to communicate with you, I am 
not acquainted with him for he is above 
me he belongs to the AIA order.

I explained as to the CA, but said I would trust to 
his good faith -

Will you favor us with his name.

[*9324*] The - Melered Angel 
He made his request for this evening because 
he will only appear on the Sabbath Day

We will do as you wish.

I presume your connexion as Guardian & Charge 
is not completely commenced

[*9325*] It has

Mr Mackenzie will now ask his Questions as I 
have only called in consequence of his being unexpectedly 
present

If any further instruction &c [*KM*]

[*9326*] I have not at present

In describing the [?] on your Seal you stated 
the ladder on he left referred to the Miracle of the 
Roman Church - rather than to the Church in 
which I was Educated [*KM*]

[*9327*] I do not favor either Church but am inclined 
rather towards both. when the rank weeds are 
rooted out of protestantism and the
[*100*]

falsehood and deceit out of Roman Catholicism 
then the two religions may form one & 
that one - be perfection

I know each sect to be right the 
one when they pray to GOD through 
Jesus Christ as the Mediator and Savior 
and the other to be right when they pray 
with faith to the Mother of him also as 
Mediator, I also know the first to be 
wrong when they make him the only 
Mediator and the last to be also wrong 
when they make her in any way part 
of the divinity

May I request you will appear to Mr H - & give him 
the promised System of Astrology whether I am 
present or not. [*KM*]

[*9328*] Then I will do so

Will you give a portion of that work this Evening 
as I have very few questions to ask [*KM*]

[*9329*] I prefer not doing it to day.

In the development of the faculty of Spirit Seeing 
is not the Seers Vision a progressive ascending 
through the Atmosphere [?] the higher Spheres [*KM*]

[*9330*] It is undoubtedly a fact that persons 
first inspecting who have not their faculty 
fully developed communicate with a lower 
order of beings than they do at a later 
period a lower Spirit is attached to the 
Medium to which they are attached that 
is the Crystal, the Mirror, or Vessel of Water 
and they show the Seer visions of small 
objects on the Surface of the Earth, just 
the likenesses of them and the images of 
living people - The next stage of Sight
[*101*]

above this is that in which they see the 
individual forms of persons able to communicate 
with them that is Atmospheric Spirit & 
then their abodes and things Spiritual.

Then they see Spiritual intelligences that 
move about in the Atmosphere that have 
been living but are dead to the flesh. and 
then Spirits that have never been embodied 
and then guardian Spirits and after that 
any kind that they may desire, but in 
the first stages it is most probable that 
evil Spirits will at times appear not because 
they are waned, or the means used are in 
any way deficient but because those using 
the Mirrors or Crystals have not got into 
unity and sympathy with those who have 
power over the means of working

I trust that when I have the black Mirror you 
will so soon as possible appear to me yourself 
may I ask if you were ever Embodied upon this 
Earth [*KM*]

[*9331*] I have never been embodied

& may I repeat the 1st part of my last question [*KM*]

[*9332*] I will attach myself to it as soon as it is 
made and will appear to you as soon 
as you are able to see me.

Are you the Guardian Spirit of any other person 
now living or have you been so. [*KM*]

[*9333*] I am the guardian Spirit of another Person 
I have never been so before.

When on a late occasion of my Calling you in Mr H's 
ES Crystal a Star & Crescent appeared may I ask if 
this was a Symbol from you. [*KM*]

[*9334*] It was a Signal of my hearing & understanding 
you.

Please to show

9345   [illustration]

Do you know the C.A.

9348   I do.

I mentioned my connexion with the C A. & requested his 
reasons for appearing

9349   I come not to dispute the doctrines of [the] 
your Guardian Spirit, but rather to ratify 
them, I too am desirous of furthering by 
Every Effort the Knowledge of Spiritualism 
among men. the time is gradually 
approaching when the barrier between the 
two intelligences shall no longer exist 
because Mutuality shall be refined and 
Spirit without losing its dignity mix with 
it more intimately and the end this communion 
must lead to, I desire with my whole being 
to promote. -----
105
Man's knowledge of his own Soul of its place
in Eternity and of that Souls GOD.
     I ask him to think earnestly & intently
of his own after life and to meditate deeply
on the way of making it a life of happiness
and of eternal freedom,  and to pray that
those means may be make known to him.
     The prayer shall never fail that is addressed
to the hearts deity , to the being that your
nature can look up to as the highest, do
you worship him as a power, as an all
pervading influence as one having a position
in Space - It is the same - from true
worship will come true knowledge.

May I ask your views as to the important doctrine
of Jesus Christ being the only Mediator

9350   He is the mediator that is provided for
Man, his is the only mediator that is
necessary for man to use - The one that
is most acceptable in the sight of GOD.
And the one most able to intercede for him
And it is man's duty to ask by him and
through him for grace & salvation

The doctrine of a sacrifice is certainly the most
Antient and most unusual, in all times & Creeds it
has found a place & connected with it  I know are
many occult mysteries.  May I ask your view of
the Christian view of the Sacrifice & atonement
for mortals by Christ's death upon the Cross.

9351   I do not look upon his death as a 
sacrifice to GOD.  I look upon it more as
typical of separating - of the destruction of
the body and of the everlasting life that
comes from it - then - and also of the
[Namely] of the Spirit because it shows that it
is [careless] of the greater suffering the body
can endure when it knows that the Spirit
is [founded] for and also as  [afril] finishing
lesson of the great life that it [closed??].
   He showed that thou [finest] may
suffer most and that the sufferings of the
world and the flesh are not the inflictions
of divine providence for sin
May I ask what your answer would be[??] [who]
advocated the [Christian] doctrine of the [universal]
Soul of the world - that [matter] is [founded] by
intelligence is [ever...??] - and [??] in fact
Deity.
What although matter and spirit exist
universally blended together, they remain
9352
everlastingly different that the two [natures]
can be made perfectly separate, that one
can pervade the other and make life
can separate from it and produce [death].
   That the spirit is infinitely superior
to matter, is made manifest by this [very]
[forever] of [Coming] into it and [moving] [of]
and of leaving it and it is [hill]
Is nature then nothing more than the blending [him]
of Spirit and matter.
It is not for when you say matter you
mean [?] thing of substance, every thing
that is seen, that would be seen or felt
and when you say spirit you mean [power]
and strength invisible agency intelligence
mind [??]method regularly, [time]
the [??] all things felt to be existing
and yet unseen. there two [??] are the
[*107*]

only ones necessary for the constitution of all
things.

The Advocates of the Universalistic theory Contend [*KM*]
that motion being every where perceptible, that
Motion is itself the evidence of the identity of the
deity of the universe

9354
Co[?] and thee keeping up of so nice a
System is certainly evidence of a power
greatly Superior to the bodies that move.

his GS.

[*2597 9365*] I have no doubt that he would make him a 
good guardian Spirit, but they must come together 
before you are able to decide, they must agree 
when they meet for the change to be beneficial 
I think it very desirable that his GS should 
be at once changed at the same time if he 
has a higher one he must constrain himself to 
treat him with religious respect.

Will you kindly make an appt with Eliesmo to appear

interest me [by] them and bring me into

something under his direction that should

the directions given in an old [Spanish ??]
that I have, and I have seen most -
exquisite things, and have followed them
[more steadily] through and when waking
have remembered what I had seen
   I wanted to know whether this is

it was done by Evil or had a [lending of to]

Why dont you come & see me I have a large collectin

9387
I have seen it in the parlor.

Ms Bumpstead has a Customer an Officer in the Army
Now in Wales who buys many books of him on these
Subjects

9388
I have bought several there but 2 or 3
dozen are as many as I can carry with
me at a time into Spain, and there I
have a Collection altho' not a large one

I have been promised by the Spirits in the Mirror
[Apics?] or rather Translations for me to Copy of Books
existing in the Spirit World on various subjects

9389
Yes they will do it
I must say to my shame that I am not
a good hand at reading English - so that it
makes it a tedious job to read through one
of the old works on Magic, that you so much
like

I believe there are very few printed books in Spanish
upon Occult Subjects

9390
No there are very few Pubd. because it is
against the law, they would be taken up for
Sorcery & Witchcraft - but there is a good
deal of Knowledge of such things in an under
Current and Amongst very respectable
Society.

May I ask if you are in London now

9391
I am in England
115

I and my Seer are going to the Princess's to see the 
Midsummers Nights Dream - I thought we might 
See you there.

9392   Its very stupid of you to go to the Princess's 
when the little Theatre in the Haymarket 
is open.

I never liked the Haymarket & dont think much of 
the Company

9393   If its a Comedy I dont mind going
I will tell you when I shall be in London
the next time you look.

Here is Miss Selina & you have not spoken to her

9394   I am not so presumptuous as I used to be

She wishes to know if you are married yet

9395   I have had so many disappointments
but if she would receive a part of a heart
for it is so wounded there is but little left
I should dare to hope that my miserable
life might be made content if not happy
Good night

               ♀︎die 28 Nov. 1856
                             C. A Mirror - present Mr H Lea,
1/4 before 8 PM              Invoked Eltesmo.
I explained at length Mr Leas wishes as to changing 
his GS. and also that Lero desired to be released from 
his charge - and Mr L's wish (DV) that Eltesmo 
might take the office.

9396   The Guidance of Almighty God may be 
sought indirectly in all things but it 
behooves man to make use for himself of 
all those means within his power, for 
the benefit of his own spiritual welfare. and 
those who can communicate with their GS. 
through peculiar means are bound to 
exert themselves to procure advantages 
that to those who have not the means of 
even knowing that they possess a GS. 
cannot of course use.
     If any mean has a conviction that 
he might be better than he is w[h]ere a 
change to take place in his Spiritual 
Adviser, he must do all in his power to 
attain the desired end, and establish a 
more perfect union - If Mr Lea feels a 
desire for Change and Lero also feels 
the same desire, that, is certain evidence 
that it would be for the good of both [if] 
were they separated
     The first of all things necessary to know 
I would speak to him of his Religious 
opinions
     If you do that which is right that 
which can find favor in the Eye of GOD
117
9396
You must believe through faith , in the 
three persons in one GOD — the first the
great being that has existed from Eternity
the Creator of the world the Governor of all
things visible and invisible — and the two
separate parts of His own body, the one
thrown off from him an all pervading
influence that comes down into his creation
and makes it good Endows it with His
life and the second the Member of His
body that was of Him that came down
and was born into the flesh and returned
Spiritualized to be again one with Him
You must believE in the divinity of His
Offspring. , in the Sanctification by His
holy influence of those who followed
the teaching in the action of their lives
which that Son left upon earth. In
his merits as mediator + advocate from
those to the father who possess the Holy
Spirit through the merits of his works
And that he died not for a Sacrifice but
for an example to show that the Holy
[Calm?] that can alone attend the dying
hours of the righteous, could still be the
same in the Struggles and Agony of the
body even nailed to the Cross. and also
to show that no circumstances in life
No persecution or misery or suffering
made a distinction in the form of Him
who in all that is bestowed by His hand
is alike for rich and for Poor. — And you
must believe not in the forms & Ceremonies
of any Church having Effect with GOD
118

but in the silent and heartfelt Prayer 
that makes its way to Him in difficulties 
and is acceptable to him through its own 
strength and through the humility and 
purity of mind in which it is offered - 
these are the necessary points of religious 
doctrines - do you believe them -

Mr Lea replied

9397    Do you believe in them because you are 
told by others that you should do so, or 
from your own Conviction from the doctrines 
themselves drawn after deep reflection of 
their own truth.

Mr Lea replied affirmatively

 9398   I am willing to become your Guardian Spt 
If you are willing to become my Charge 
but first ask me questions that may arise 
to your mind and satisfy yourself that 
I am in your Estimation fit for the Task.

Mr Lea observed he could place the greatest confidence 
in Eltesmo as a GS. the more so as the CA had 
vouched that he was a good and truthful Spirit

 9399    Then I must also have sole charge of 
the means by which I appear and I 
will do my best for the furtherance of 
an intercourse, that has never yet and 
never will fail in the end of bring 
advantages to men who investigate it 
solely with a love of its truth & for the 
benefit of Spiritual Knowledge.

I replied on behalf of Mr Lea as to my intention 
of discharging the Mirror - & Calling Lero in his mirror 
explain the Circumstances - & then dedicate the mirror 
to Eltesmo.
[?] Original Vol.    p
119

That is right and when I appear there I
shall unite my self to you by giving you
my Seal:

Now Eltesmos leaving

1/2 past 8                 Lero's MIrror.
                                Invoked Lero
Lero is here in black robes.
I explained at length on behalf of my friend Lea
the purport of his present visit  to Croydon, that
Eltesmo had consented to relieve him of his charge
& wished to  know if it met his approval

9400    I do wish that we were parted, not 
because [th] I have any but the very kindest
feelings towards Mr Lea.  for I would do
all in my power to benefit him, but
because I feel and believe that our being
united retards our mutual progress.
keeps him bound to my limited & uncertain
knowledge, and me from that freedom
which it is necessary to have in order to
gain for myself the blessing that I
cannot give him.

Mr. Lea returned thanks for Lero's past favors & asked
if he had any objections to Eltesmo as a G S.

9401    You have done well in your choice, may 
he be to you what I have wished that
I might be as great as my desire that
he should be.

Mr. Lea hopes altho' you will now cease to be his G S.
you will if he feels an occasion to call you. appear

9402     It will make no difference and I shall
always be happy to appear & give you
any instructions which I may deem
[*120*]

of benefit to your worldly interest - 
Eltesmo will devote himself to his higher 
duty.

Shall I or my friend Lea discharge the Mirror 
from your Custody & dedicate it to Eltesmo.

[*9403*] You discharge it because you can do it 
more powerfully - Mr Lea aiding you 
with his wishes -

We retd thanks jointly

[*9404*] I thank you and wish you all well

I then discharged the Mirror which immediately 
became filled or covered with a thick black 
cloud and fearing Evil Spirits might seize this 
opportunity to appear. I conjured very strongly 
& the cloud became gradually less going off to 
a great distance till it became a mere spec. & 
then vanished, the mirror becoming most dazzlingly 
bright -

Invoked Eltesmo.

1/4 to 9.

Eltesmo is here.

I explained what had passed as above. & asked if it 
met his approval.

[*9405*] It has. - Let us now earnestly and 
humbly pray with our whole being 
that with him. who has gone forth to 
seek a footing in the sphere from which 
he has unfortunately fallen may 
depart all influence of an evil tendency 
and let us ask with humility that your 
future and his future may be higher 
and happier for the separation, & earnestly 
call down a blessing of Almighty GOD on
121

9405   the undertaking now Commenced (10' to 9) 
And may I be so strengthened and so 
guided in the right as to give to you a 
knowledge and faith in the goodness &
Mercy of GOD.  that shall lead you thro'
this life in peace and open for you the
portals of a Mansion -- in which for you the 
happy Spirit shall reign for ever & ever.

Mr Lea replied 

9406   Be it so.

May I ask if you have any particular day or days
on which you prefer appearing

9407    I will appear on Tuesdays, but he can
have visions on another evening.

May I ask for the Seal you so kindly promised
Now he has held out his hand & the stone became
larger and covered the other fingers -- & Emma copied
the inscription

9408  [illustration]

May I ask if Mr Lea should have made one on Silver
to use with the Mirror & the other on parchment to
carry with him --

9409   Two may be made on Parchment.

Mr Lea will then with your permission call on
Tuesdays & on another Evening receive the Spiritual
Visions you may favor [with] him with. --
122

May I ask if you have any advice or instruction 
to favor him with as to his future working with 
this mirror now dedicated to you.

9410   I can speak to him of that hereafter 
I have nothing this Evening -

930. Eltesmo left. -
Action Ended.

                           2nd Dec'r. 1856    C A Mirror
8 PM.          Invoked the CA.
On ♀︎die last my friend Mr Lea had an interview with 
Eltesmo. who had kindly consented to be his GS and we 
released Lero from his office - may I ask if it meets 
your approval

2603  9411   It does, I think there can be no doubt of 
the Good that will arise from it -

I ment'd Mr Anderson's Experiment to procure Spiritual Visions 
when asleep. I asked if he might practice it safely

2604   9412   It is the proper means of attaining the 
desired end - and to use it once or twice 
would not do him any harm, but it is 
not advisable that any one should resort to 
this means of communication often as it weakens 
and wears out the body.

May I mention that on ♂︎die last. probably owing to my 
Seer not being free from pain - The Translation of your 
work came exceeding slowly - may I request if possible 
that it may be rendered quicker & more legible

2605   9413    I will make it as plan as I can, but 
it necessarily takes some time to decypher

If any &c

2606  9414   I have not this Evening

Will Mohamed Ali inform me when it will be 
agreeable for him to appear.

2607   9415   I do not know   I think it would be best
123 

for you to call him again

I thank you I will do so, at the end of our sitting

1/4 past 8  the C A left and the book came

2608   9416  "Matter & Spirit united Animate a body & it 
lives &c.

1/4 to 10.

                            Invoked Mohamed Ali - thrice
                             No Vision
Action Ended

                         ♂︎die 23rd Dec. 1856
                                                    C A Mirror
                           Invoked the C. A.
The C. A. appeared in white dress purple robes and a 
large piece rather lighter than the rest hanging over the 
right shoulder 

Allow me to observe that in consequence of my Seer's having 
been very unwell with sore throat &c I have been unable 
to call lately as usual, and as she still suffers much 
I will not delay you this Evening, nor shall I be 
able to receive the continuation of your esteemed Metap'l. 
Work. but hope to do so next Tuesday.

2609   9417  I should have been very pleased to have 
shown it to you this Evening but if you 
are unable to receive it I will continue it 
next Tuesday more easily I trust than 
hitherto.

My friend Lea has also I regret to add been very 
ill.  he informs that he has called Eltesmo without 
having been able to see him (ie his Seer) may I call 
him into this Mirror this Evening

2610   9418   He will appear to you this evening if you 
desire it.
Visit to Capt'n Morrison, query where  -  at. Tavistock [?].
124

He would appear to Mr Lea I am certain 
had he a Seer of sufficient power but I 
have no doubt after a few trials she will 
succeed.

I shall be at his home on Friday next. - If Eltesmo 
consents to appear have I your permission to 
invoke for Mr. Lea.

2611   9419   Yes but do not use the Green Crystal 
when the Green Crystal was in my possession & was 
ded'd to Holo  I had great difficulty in obtaining 
Visions, may I ask if any Evil influence connected 
with it,  can be dispelled & I can dedicate it to a 
good spirit.

2612   9420    The Colour is very much against it, 
but there is no evil influence attached to it
now.  Since the departure of Lero it is 
without a spirit, and I do not wish you 
to use it because I am not certain what 
would appear.
     It cannot be consecrated & dedicated 
to a high spirit because they feel repulsed 
by the offer of any thing this is contrary 
to their natural color.  it is an insult 
to their position

It might I presume be used for calling At Spirits

2613   9421   Such would appear in it but he must 
carefully exorcise all those who do appear 
before he placed faith in their answers.  
for it is also open to those much lower 
Eltesmo's power would keep the worst 
from it.

I met at a friends house a few evenings since [?] Morrison
& he showed me the Crystal which he had purchased
at Lady Blessingtons sale and about which he
[*125*]

published such absurd statements as to its origin 
antiquity powers &c I at once recognized it for 
the [gentle?] ornament of a large Chandelier formerly in 
one of the palaces in Paris. & destroyed during the 
Revolution in 18 (Chapr. 10th) & brought with 12 smaller 
ones to this Country. - I think I cannot be mistaken 
may I ask if you are aware whether it is so or not

[*2614 9422*] I could enquire about it.

As next Tuesday is Christmas day may I ask 
if this time is one of rejoicing with you in the 
Spirit World.

[*2615 9423*] We have no cause for rejoicing at this 
period more than we know that it is 
the anniversary of the earthly birth of 
Christ, and in connexion with Man 
and the world, it gives another assurance 
by reminding him and us of the 
Salvation of his Soul. and of the means 
by which it is obtained

And it also reminds that the 
Second coming of Him to the earth 
to reap the reward of his labor, to glorify 
himself and his people is not far distant

I have also to remark that our kind friend 
Mr Till is very unwell - I hope, however, he will 
shortly be able to favor us with another Sitting

[*2676 9424*] I am sorry that he is ill I shall 
be pleased to see him again. - and 
will you tell Mr Lea of my wishes 
for his health and spiritual happiness 
That he may succeed in his endeavors 
and have the benefit of a free and easy 
communication with the highest being 
of the Spirit World

1/2 past 8. CA left.
The question really was.  If I invoke for him do you think
       you will be able to appear to his wife -- 
[*126*]

8 30 PM. C A Mirror

Invoked Eltesmo

Eltesmo is here as before.

My friend Lea has invoked you in the Mirror dedd to 
you but without success. I intend being with him 
on Friday next. have I your permission to call you 
in his mirror for him, as I am very anxious that 
he should succeed in his much coveted desire of 
holding Commn with you.

[*9425*] You have and my Assurance that I 
will come into the Mirror. It is a 
Source of regret to me that I have yet 
been unable to be seen. and have been 
obliged to leave as I entered

Mr Lea has not called so strongly 
as you have done, I believe because his will 
has been weakened by Illness.

If I invoke for him do you think his wife will 
be able to see you.

[*9426*] I think I shall and if you call me 
with energy, my appearance to her may 
be plainer, and if she sees me plain 
through that. she will see me afterwards 
if he calls, even if his Invocation is weaker 
than yours.

May I at some future time hope to receive one of 
the Spiritual Treatises you formerly referred to

[*9427*] I will give it you with pleasure

As my Seer is too unwell to read without much pain 
I will with your permission, detain you no longer.

Eltesmo gone.

♀ die Dec. 26. 1856 - Stonehouse
Eltesmo's Mirror - Mr. Lea [Ipex?]

8.15' PM

In a few minutes the mirror became veiled with 
a thick mist which became very thick & dark 
it then became intensely bright & luminous and 
Eltesmo appeared only in outline as a still 
brighter light, and then slightly to darken 
when a very [light] bright light appeared (doubtless 
the Stone which fastened his robe)
          After [constraining?] very urgently I enquired 
if he would please to inform us of his presence & 
answer our questions - when there appeared
[*9428*] I am here according to my promise
and then stated that he would appear more 
plainly each time he was called, that Mr. 
Lea should call on Tuesday and that it would 
greatly assist in developing Mr. Lea's sight, if 
I would Invoke on the Friday following
          That Mr. Lea could not see a Vision 
this Evening plain enough to describe it - as he 
should wish but that she would ultimately 
have her Spiritual Vision as perfect as my 
Seeress - he then verified the 3 copies of 
his Seal - I upon being asked if he could 
advise Mr Lea as to his illness, recommended 
him to attend to the advice of his Physician 
- that he would prefer the Mirror being placed 
agt. the Wall & that he would with great 
pleasure appear to my friend Lea & give him 
all the information he might be permitted to give.

the book. -- Now the face has come from the inside
of the Compasses to a small space outside -- the hand
has opened the book.  -- It is very beautiful
inside, it looks like a picture  there are two figures
with wings on each side of a little Oval -- the oval
in the middle [has reading] of the oval there are words or figures  [it is] & beautifully
colored --  This remained some time - & as my
hour for using the C A Mirror was at hand  I tried
to dismiss the Vision  but it remained & I placed it
in my [box] cabinet in the parlor -- [and at]
                                    [(continued at page 132)] go to top of page 132 *

8 PM    C A Mirror
            Invoked the C A.
The C A appeared and I returned thanks for Eltesmo's
appearance at Mr Lea's at Limehouse & requested to 

[*129*]

to be informed if the CA had made the promised 
Enquiry about Mr Morrisons Crystal.

[*2617 9430*] I have

I was told that you were right, and that 
there were 5 of the same kind suspended 
on were as pendants to a chandelier, three 
of them are now in England, and two were 
purchased one by a French Lapidary 1 was 
broken up for some purpose that is not 
known and that the other was ground 
& mixed with glass to make a prepared 
Chrystal for divining.

Mr Morrison's is one of the two largest of 
[which size there were two was another.] 
and there were 3 small like that [Mr Dresser's] 
I have ascertained that Orion is still the 
Spirit of Mr Morrisons - that he was 
attached to it before it was possessed 
by Lady Blessington. and that 
UNIAN is now the Spirit of Mr. 
Dressers - the 3rd is in the possession 
of a Mr Cope residing in Yorkshire and 
the Spirit of that is VERTEL

I thank you. Mr Dresser has sent me his Crystal 
which he formerly offered to give to me - I then 
mentioned the vision which had just appeared

[*2618 9431*] It is probably some vision that has 
reference to Mr Dresser, that he has called 
at some time and been unable to see 
unless you have discharged it, and then 
it would be a vision for you presented 
by the Spirit

I did exorcise it strongly when it came into my
130
hands I [?] very Strongly at night before going to
Sleep as I was under Such sil influences, when it 
was last here. And Union agurd Spring
2619
9432
Yes, a low Spirit but not a bad one.
If you saw that vision there is in occasion 
to make a practice of Comming with the
Spirit Union, you could finish that
[outwith] in any way commiting Yourself 
as you did not call it.
I explained in my bookl as to Spiritual that has to be entirely 
Gonded by the las.
2620
9432
I understand you, and think it would 
be best for you to look again, when there is 
nothing at all of tensions and those who desire
to show you a vision are as low as your 
Knowledge goes good it is but comleiy 
to see it out there is no reasion for you
Even to address it, as to connect yourself
with it in any way. So that I should 
 advise you when you have time to look 
again.
May look of you kindly appear again after 
Arel has received the Information of the book.
2621
9434
Yes I will
the las going I the books Come
8, 20 PM.

9435
“The knowledge of the tenth boom and Spirits
is limited etc. ec.”
20 ' 10 10 PM booked the La
As my Seer shill suffer with [?] that I am 
opind to let her speak much longer, it has therefor
requested the form of your appearance now this Evng

131
the last evening of the present year on which we shall
have the pleasure of receiving your valued Comm'ns 
& I wished to dedicate its close, like its beginning to 
you accept my thanks &c &c. 

2623
9436
I had hoped if circumstances permitted 
to have given you that work entire on the 
first Tuesday in the New Year, it takes
much longer for you to decipher than I 
anticipated but I think that now it
becomes plainer, as you have not been 
able to finish it, we must continue it
every Tuesday until it is finished
I am quite aware that there are many 
faults which composition those I trust 
to you to alter. I hope that you will 
do so, but I am also aware that in it is 
contained that which may be clothed in
the most perfect language, and that
all the doctrines there put forward are 
such only as I know to be True.

I regret to hear the Work is so near its close I had
hoped it would have lasted much longer.

2624
9437
It is not near its close because I anticipated
your looking Every Tuesday and You know
that you have missed several and you
have not read on Each evening nearly the
Quantity that I had allotted.
I trust that the Coming year may be one
 of benefit to both of us, and that it may
not only for us, but for all others be a 
happy and prosperous one.

[* *The Monks MS Cont'd* *]

10 PM. directly [Emma] the Seer [took Mr Dressers] looked into the Crystal - she said
 it is still Clouded. the books is there open. & the mans face
& shoulders. [& the] with one hand held up [and] the book has
opened [just] in the same place - it [looks] The leaves very richly
illuminated. in gold color  [there is an arch at the top.] & [one] an [one of the] 
Angels is standing on a Crushed ball. [under its feet]
   [The title page is illuminated in Gold & Colors.] [Now] and
theres a Clouds of colors coming up under the other 
figure - at the bottom behind white like smoke then purple
blue pink & Golden Colored which covers up to their
wings - In the oval the reading is not [in] English
or like letters, its large Enough to be read. [two or three]
[of the letter look like ducks with their heads under
water] --
[Miss Emma] the seer then Copied the Contents of the Oval.  when
     [Now theres] a little strip of paper came
underneath the title page with three words on
9438                  CHALDEE
                           MAGI
                           SACRI

Now the [face] Man is looking at you                     I then asked
[Is that] Are these words a translation of the Contents of the Oval
Now he has nodded his head -- The figure then pointed
to my papers on the Table and I asked if I should
make my title page of the Arcana Magica similar at
which he again nodded -. I then asked if he
would appear again & he pointed to the Clock
on the Mantel piece & turned his finger round
a number of times & I asked if he meant this
day  week  & he nodded his head. I departed
20' past 10 PM.

☉die  4 Jan. 1857.

1 PM Emma & I
[We] were conversing this morning without meaning to invoke 
when. E proposed inspecting Mr Dressers Crystal, & upon 
taking it up. it immediately clouded, without invoking 
& she said
Now the books coming it comes in very slowly from the 
right to the left - 2' now its opened - one fly leaf and 
then the title, the color of the paper is like your old MSs 
The drawing is very beautiful the light which comes 
from the top. makes the figures on the left [?] all golden light and 
the [?] itself appears vapory - the other figure is 
altogether darker [than the drawing]
May I request the Characters in the Title to be 
[to] decyphered.
     Now the leaf is turning over, the title is blank 
at the back. theres a formal pattern for the border of the 
next leaf and reading in the middle [black letters] these 
letters are all beautifully done in Colors but no gold 
thus. in amber green and red.

[*9439*]                    SPIRITS 
                                    OF THE 
                       SUN MOON AND STARS 
                                     THEIR 
                                TALISMANS 
                                      AND 
                                    POWER

Now that leafs turned over, on this side (a) theres 
the radiant Spirit standing, full face in a Circle. the 
bottom of the Circle hides the lower part of the figure 
and underneath the Circle is an oval now theres
around ball under the oral divided into 4 parts  134
[Now] theres [arod] one side and three bright lines
of color Purple Green and Yellow and on the small
oral one the same characters as in the oral of the
[tile??] - on the other side /B/ there is nothing but
beading and the same border as around the [title?]
[As] the [book?] in the Chrystal has only about 2 inches long the
leading [was] [certainly] too small to [??] and I got
my oral mirror down and requested [Himan]
to transfer the vision to the oral mirror - that it might
be read for [??] extremely distinct & beautifully executed
it was too small to read, the [??] [??] did 
not pass into the mirror and upon handing [Emma?] a
magnifying glass, it enlarged the character [but rend]
them less distinct - there appeared about 2 dozen lines
on the page.
I then reqeusted the spirit of the crystal [either] to transfer
the vision or to send in the words one by one.
   [Now] theres an attempt at reading coming [under]
the [brok??] in very [?hazzling] letters
"The Book would best [own] plainly in an [uncomennted?] 9440
mirror is crystal"
I asked shall it be a plain glass or silvered [mirror]
9441
"Tuesday like that but [??]"
I am engaged on Tuesdays cannot it be on some
other days -
9442
Wednesday Thursday Friday
Saturday Sunday. Noon.
We will look in on Odie at noon
1/4 to 2 [noonish] gone & the books gone.

5 PM 
The this here as usual 
Nurions to receiving the book may I ask a few questions 
2625 
9443 
9/es 
May I asked why on last Cuemey /Ddu 5th./ when at 
all P’s I could ask has a vision Either in the Oral [M] 
Or Sapem Crystal. 
2626 
9444 
You cannot see all kinds of visions you might 
Call. Unless you have such a spirit that you 
wanted to see on a previous Evening, and then 
he would make an appointment 
I could not appear on mondays but 
You would have seen a vision in Mr thessus 
Crystal. 
I have been offered in that ¢ a copy of the ells 
Chalder inagi sacri—as in Spiritual mathere I place 
myself entirely under your guidance hains I your 
Permission to reens it =
2627
9445
You can see the book and copy it but rulef
in the same way that you would the book
of a man curious to you from its rarity 
and beauty—
But do not call for it, and have as 
Little as possible to do with the Spirit that
Shows it, I can prevent him from having any connection with you by other means
I can and would prevent his Appearance
In any Consecuted allisir because I believe
that it is using such for a pinpoig which 
they are not intended and no high 

136 
Names should be used in Connection with 
them. 
Nen I am merely to ask the Spirit of the elliniv to 
and him the Vision 
2628 
2446 
Yes. but you must not call Spirits into that 
and mean Spirits of a higher class than the 
one that it belongs to, the likenesses of 
Mistals canta be seen by asking for their 
Appearance, objects and places could also 
be Seen on a limited scale of come on 
Account of its Size. 
I shall be so, I place implicit faith in you in 
then matters. 
2629 
9447 
Can you See Ellessev this Evening he 
wishes to appear 
Yes, Shall I see him before or after receiving the book 
2630 
9448 
After. 
May I ask of Ada the Spirit of my Appein Caplad 
Ashed appear. 
2631
9449 
She would appear this Evening son

the is here as before. 
I mentioned the La’s remarked that E. Inshed to appear
I also my hormy Called for Mr Len again on Tuesday
last. X the result. 
137

9452
I am afraid she will never see me as I wish
to appear, I would willingly do so most
willingly for it is my sole desire to do
my duty by one that I have taken under
my charge., they do not seem to call me
as you do, when I try to appear they do
not encourage it by such desire and such
means such prayer as would [will to make]
to make me more near to them. and
when I have left they associate themselves
with Spiritual beings that are very low
in the Atmosphere - Spiritual beings they
are not - I was wrong they have only
the resemblance of such. and if they
encourage and are familiar with those
that are very low my feelings cannot
be sufficiently in unison with theirs to
allow me to appear plain., I come
to you because you have the power of
addressing [him?] that I want, ask
them to make some other day than
Tuesday a special time for the visits of
such as can be treated with levity & jest

I explained the Circumstances at length which took place on [symbol for Venus] die (vec?) & remarked I might myself
have inadvertently led them into the Error.

9453
I have no objections to their seeing other
visions except on a Tuesday or when I am
first called, and I am always ready
and ever willing to do all in my power
to promote a free Communication between us
if they will also do their part.

I am sure my friend Lea will do his utmost
138
to meet your views If Mrs. Lea. cannot see you distinctly
will you favor them with your responses to their
Questions — that will be a constant source of
interest to him.

9454   I do not like to promise to send writing
without . I am also present ; for in such
misguided hands may be taken
advantage of to put their writing as easily
to be produced as mine , the difference
might not be known at first — when my 
Appearance is a gu[r]antee for that wch
appears with me.
     do you understand me —
After a time when we become more
united and he knows me better I shall
be able to do so , I am not at present
sufficiently Self reliant to do so, I may
have the power   I trust I have of keeping
Every thing out of that Mirror , but it is
Also possible that I have not — & that
others who have been connected with it
may be still strong Enough to exert
An influence — I wish and am determined
to make assurance doubly sure.

♀ dec 9 Jan 1857 C A Mirror
7. 30 PM
Invoked Sevenomnia 
Sevenomnia is here as before—except the border of dress is amber colored
Dr Mackenzie has favored me with a visit. he is 
desirous of proposing to you as his GS some questions
9471
I am pleased to meet him and I shall
be very pleased when the time comes for him
to commence with me frequently and
[?].
Dr M rcvd. thanks requested to know if Sma had
any further Commn. previous to proposing his questns.
9472
I have noting to say except that you
must go on trying to develope the [Sight]
power of Seeing things Spiritual that
is laying dormant within you by the
means provided only. for it requires much
trouble and attention to make them
Successful
I have made this [M] for Dr M and intend dedicating
it to you may I ask which you deem best to 
use. Black Velvet, Cloth, or Silk
9473
Black Silk is the best.
when I have completed it and dedicated it to you
for Dr Mackenzie will you kindly accept its charge 
and prevent evil Spirits theseir. 
9474
I will.
On a former occasion a star and crescent appeared
And you gave me a response in explanation may
I now ask you to be so kind as to explain
further the signification of the Signal?
9475
I used the Star as a [?] because 
It is [in]consistent with the information
that I should have given had I.
[*143*]

Appeared plainly, the half Moon is the
same I love the subject which they
portray.

May I ask you what subject that they may be

9476 The working of the planets I have
promised you my opinions inconnecting
with this - for knowledge as yet it is not 
I shall be able to give them to you in
a short time I will do so in the New
Mirror - 

An imperfectly developd Seer who occasionally
inspects for me sees nothing but initial letters
as A. N. M E.R may I ask their meaning
and were they sent by you.

9477 I sent a vision it was that seen
undistinctly by the person looking 
I did not attempt to communicate by
sentences because I knew that before
they could be made intelligible the Seer
must become accustomed to a sight of
single letters made perfect.

May I ask if you replied in the figures 18
as to the time the Seer would be developing

9478 It was myself - it was 18 months

I then asked respecting the next reply but a
conversation ensued respecting the use of [M]
and S.M A said

9479 But when you ask questions it would
be best when there is no vision appearing
to speak directly to me. and then you
may be sure that I give the answer
but if a [M] or [C] dedicated to me you
ask questions of another Spirit or
Angel or deceased mortal you cannot

144
be certain of the identity of the Answer
I (F.H) explained that I had lent Dr M. my ES.
Crystal. &c.  [*FH*]

9480
Yes but such visions of a light character
of objects surrounding you, with which
you are familiar is better adapted to develop
the sight than a single spirit in a different
state.

Would it not best when Dr M has his new [M.] that 
 [*FH*]
he should invoke you only to give visions

9481
It would, and only to see such visions
as I would show him

Would you furnish him with visions of [?] Spirits

9482
I could sanction the appearance of
some of these but I do not think
it right for all he might care to appear
there are some Atmospheric Spirits of
persons well calculated to introduce Evil
or the desire of Evil and there are some
friends whose appearance after death
I should not feel justified in allowing
as it is shocking and startling to those
remaining who of course have no knowledge
of the after state of those who may seem
to them to pass away in peace -

Will you oblige Dr M by giving a symbol whether
his [?] requests are right or otherwise

9483
I will do so - if I cannot give the
words Yes and No - at first the letters
at the beginning of the word will be
sufficient and in such cases where a 
letter sent appears should it happen that
you much desire to press the inquiry you
would see most probably the spirit
[*145*]

without my sanction for the power of
Invocation draws into unison your being
and the being called and they of their
power without my aid make visible their
form.

May I observe when I call - after the first Invocation [*KM?*]
I continue urgently Calling Mentally - is that not also
quite necessary

9484
Not altogether, it is certainly of Service
but the seal placed against the Mirror
after the first invocation keeps up an
incessant calling as it were for it shows
us in our language that we are desired
and waited for.

Have I been sufficiently careful after rising MH's E[?] [*KM?*]
Crystal in using the discharge

9485
You cannot be too careful and it should
always be your aim to do more than
you have done, to exert the whole of
your strength of will and determination of
purpose in opposition to enemies who are
ever seeking a little weakness - never fail
in your exorcism - and never fail in the
concentration of your will upon it when
using it for it is not the mere form
of words that is of Service

May I ask if it was you that appeared in the E[?]
yesterday.

9486
It was not, my features, my complexion,
my hair never change. by that I may
be known my robes may have additions
or be altered but my seal under all 
circumstances are the same

F.H. I am often uncertain how to address or speak of
a spirit as
146
Masculine or feminine

9487
You can do either  - Male or female are but
the tenants of one state beyond that
in whatever state all are the same
feminine perhaps in appearance as they
go higher because more beautiful –
perfectly beautiful is an attribute of the
Deity but masculine in mind & in purpose
for that too is perfect in its way. -

Did you only answer by the Stars and not by the
Marks.

9488
it is so a Star is always my [motto?].

Then I may distinguish the replies of Constantine
in that manner -

9489
You may

I have also a small [M] have you answered me in
that - when using it on Wednesday

9490
Yes

May I ask why you would not allow me to bring
it hither -

9491
It was quite unnecessary I could not
appear in that so plan as in this & as
you are about having another you will
not require to make use of it -

Is there any objection to my using it?

9492
There is no objection to your using it
When you can see plainly the black
mirror is best for you at first -

Will you guard my little [M]

9493
I cannot have any thing to do with it
unless it is dedicated to Spiritualism
and [Consecrated?] to [M?].

May I bring it on a future occasion & get Ms. H. 
147
to dedicated tryon
9474
You had better leave it as it is for the 
present things will not appear much 
Larger than in the Crystal—You are
unable to see in it Yourself or you would
not have regained black silk.
DM has placed the diagram of the [Seven] Spheres 
published in Mr Diomns book I asked his 
opinion
9495
The person that has made that is 
truthful, but is much mistaken it 
is not the place of the Spheres of Spirits 
ionice man and his abode. it is not
those through which he must heed
to obtain happiness in stesinity 
It is the circles wrini the Sin
that are the habitations and the contines 
of Spiritual bodies separate and dishsiet
from those who are in any way
connected with the present or the 
future of man.
May I ask of recurring to as cology of feres 
Vesta I am te have any influence and if so
what their nature may be.
9496 
They have no influence their morments
and their Silerations at firtrial times may
be taken for signs of Srents.
Disbelieves in ashology always myi them as a
proof of the absurdity of the Science to which 
my sincere reply has been that the secentualy 
of their orbits is as efficient reason for their
unimportance may I ask your view 
9497
They do proguiusheak Events they cary
out in minute partieatars the gieas
/a/ Some discussion ensued between [Dr] Mackenzie
       & [?] to the reception of books, and the
       incapacity of Conveying idea & so M   said --
                                                             the time to
148
Occurrences that are shown by the more
visible planets 

May not astrologers then use them and will you inform
us how

9498   I will when I give you the whole of my [Work]
mode of working with them.

May I ask the meaning of the Characters in the 
Talisman you gave me

9499   The Characters are Spiritual they have 
influence in our State but they have no 
meaning in yours—

[*,note a,*]   9500   The time has yet to come, the angel must 
have qualities and comprehension greater
than I.   when the language of the Spirit 
World can be made to meet the ideas of 
mortals

We were discussing the Subject again when SOM said 

9501   I have thought that the reason is 
different from that
     When you receive a book it is but the 
interchanging [of] the ideas between intelligence 
and intelligence, no matter whether 
Embodied is disembodied
The thoughts on one Subject, are thoughts 
Even if they be different but when it is 
the language that is alone made manifest 
when there is no unity of mind because 
one party is ignorant and the other 
knows all, that which is given from 
the one is unintelligible to the other.
     You may write that which is 
unintelligible to us if we do not 
appreciate the ideas that prompt it & 
it is the same as your writing an
149 
Elaborate Essay in beautiful characters full
of Power and Elegance, and placing it 
before a man, supposing him in a 
situation of naturally enlightened 
mind without education, that with
which could he be made conversant by 
your speaking. to him and which he could
appreciate in every sense — is made 
wholly unintelligible through the Characters 
being such that he cannot trace. 

[?] to the Talisman may I ask what 
planet was passing & had special influence 
upon me. 

9502   The planet under which you were born 
it has the most influence on the 
Anniversary

I presume that to be the Lord of the ascend't ☉

9503   Yes. 

Dr M. explained the repeated accidents which befel 
him & begged a talisman of SMA  could give him 
a suitable one 

9504   I cannot 

I presume that to be the reason why you gave 
the response respecting Mr H's [telesin?] 

9505   It is. 
Every one may by their own care and 
investigation upon subjects that are open 
to all, be warned of danger, and use 
means to prevent it — You will see 
on reflection that a Spirit giving (even 
Supposing it in his power  a Talisman 
to prevent Misfortunes interposing between 
man and the cause of Events laid 
out for him to pass through by the
150
of HIs Creator— If man can find a
remedy he can use it for his own cause.
I then explained at some length as to the writings
of Emanuel Swedenborg and read Arcana [?]   1266
And requested his heirs
9506
He was very much mistaken
In the first place his interviews with
Spirits took place when his Spirit left
the body and went into their world.—
instead of their taking form and [entering]
coming into his so that all the Communications he
receivEd were in Apparent sleep, when the

I immediately—“Heres the Man come who had the book, he 
has got on a brown Stuff chess. Close comes the waist. 
black straight hair black eyes; very thin sallow complexion 
his head shared on the top of the head he has something 
like a hood hanging from the back of his dress. 
May I ask your name 
9511 
I have no name now 
What was your name when on Earth
9572 
Preor Presirfheible 
Have you anything to communicate before you finish 
use with the MF.—
9573 
Yes 
I made the book you have seen when I was 
alive—I was a spaniard by birth and was 
received early into the Catholic Church—I 
Took the vows and was a priest—I became 
acquainted with many Secrets and I read 
many of the old Spanish manuscripts 
of the anheat magicians—such a study 
was prohibited but not less deemed by me 
I had much time and nothing to occupy 
it, and I was devoted with my whole
heart and Soul to seeking of hidden things 
At last my greatest wishes were fulfilled 
and I saw beings disembodied. I was 
uneducated in the ways of the world but 
brought up to be comasant with horns, I was 
hardened to sights of peiranice and sufferring 
and I was constantly employed in hypporing 
and deceit—my calling obliged me to be 
so—I saw and conenced with Spirits 
to whome these things were hateful, by 
153
9573 
them I was persuaded and I believe helped 
to flee from the Brotherhood that would 
have persecuted me to death—I continued 
my commission with these Spirits, I knew 
not except from what they told me (their 
nahne or office-94) I called them only with 
intense deice and they left me when they 
pleased—I know of no exorcism—those 
that I believed to be good then. I know now 
to be [there were] different. I went away for 
the current and left the foimtry with my 
book then but half completed—that I 
measured more than my life, and my 
companions still attending me I harrelled 
Into Rome. I was introduced by them 
into the society of the Rosicrsciasis 
Some of them I cannot even now believe 
were human, if they were they had 
attained powers that men ought not to 
obtain for they did things that I call ons 
As I was, and so well acquainted with dights 
Earthly and ghastly made me [made me] 
tremble in fear and believe that they had 
the working of the Universe—as that 
place my book was Completed, I sought 
the same powers that they had and learned 
nearly every form that they went through 
every ceremony that was used at their 
meetings—
I returned and know not why 
impelled perhaps by Spirits—careless 
or any temporal safely. to the Town 
that I had fled from—it was at the 
time of the inquisition—with my magic 
Secrets my tales means of power to me 
[*153*]

[*9513*] harmless and some involving destruction 
I performed [marvels?] before persons who gave me 
up to its "Justice"

I should have been more careful 
for I might have saved myself even then 
but I relied on the aid that had been given 
me before - I did wonders that could not 
be reconciled with the actions of nature 
it was evident to all that I did it by the 
aid of Spirits but I did not know any 
more than they the nature or the qualities 
of those who helped me, I was tried for 
being possessed by the devil and for practicing 
black magic, I attempted to deny it 
but I can solemnly swear that I used 
not on that occasion, when I knew the 
sentence would be death. one word that 
I knew to be untrue, I would not 
compromise my dignity sufficiently to 
evade them or their questions and when 
I denied their accusations it was with 
a sincere conviction of their falsehoods 
Every Spirit that I had seen was of 
a pleasing form. I believed that the 
Enemy of Man was otherwise - the 
communication that I had had with 
them tended to make me better (than 
I should have been or) rather than I 
was without their agency being sought 
the knowledge that they gave me was 
I believed though startling & wonderful 
innocent - for they in their chains and 
Talismans mentioned him not  by any 
of the names known to me in all my 
reading of black magic - I had never
155
used a sacrifice and on my conscience. I 
Could affirm that I had never used it for 
the pinpore of singing to any living creature 
I had never done with at one penticle of 
the injing, which they did every hour in 
their dungeons—
Hearing I should be shortly distimbed and requested to be 
informed if O defleques would appear and time to 
continue his hanation when he replied /
9574 
I will be as concise as possible I have 
not much to say, I was tried and condemned 
to death by Judges hearing only one side 
but before death was alloned me as the 
greatest blessing they could give, I was 
Cruelly tortured for they had a liking 
for the Secrets for which I was finished  
and out of the poor inetches they tortured 
they got secrets for which they might have 
as pistly been finished themselves. 
I had many such companions in my 
prison and not make 23 days after the 
Sentence and the end come that I had 
looked for and to and beyond, wish 
Such agonized delight—I had been 
told that there was an after life and 
realized it sufficiently peace me if not 
happy as to make me bear with 
apparent composing the influtions of 
my Enemies—
Up to this time I had managed 
to keep my book undisconsed I had 
seron it in the mattrass I had laid 
upon the first night, and that until 
after my imprisonment—with my teeth 
[*156*]

[*9514*] [?] teeth I unwrapped and with a nail found 
in the wall I put the thread in that 
I picked out and made it appear the 
same as before, and when this was taken 
away from me I may safely say that 
it caused me more pain, more uneasiness 
more anxiety, than their inflections, or 
the anxiety of my doom - I was so 
fearful that they should have the power 
I was so soon to lose. -

I was to be burned and the night 
before it was customary to allow the prisoners 
the indulgence of a bed and a meal 
imagine my joy even at that hour when 
my old mattress was brought back 
I picked out my book and concealed 
it in my dress until the last moment 
came and then with despairing energy 
when that was no longer of avail, I 
clasped it in my hands determined it 
should be burnt with me, I thought not 
so much of [that as of] myself as of that 
and I went to the stake as firm 
perhaps. as the frailty of the flesh 
will allow a mortal to do - many 
of us were burned and to this circumstce. 
or to those again interposing who were 
not of earth. I must owe the preservatn. 
of my books from the sight up to 
this time of the officials around me 
It was not until a moment or two 
before my execution that they attempted 
to grasp it the chains that they had 
put in my hands I had bound round
[*157*]

[*9514*] my book and I held it as tight as the 
will of man, [?] by death can & 
I hurried quickly into the very flames 
to get it out of their reach, I succeeded 
and I saw it in flames when only the 
soles of my feet were scorched, as the 
flames went on consuming me my senses 
left. delirium came on and I believe[d] 
that I raved - my passing from 
life into immortality, from time to 
Eternity - was certainly a fearful one.

When my Spirit was released 
and I was again whole, the same 
as I am now. when I started into 
being the same as life, yet now changed 
I found my book with me & myself 
surrounded by those who had been 
so often my Companions on earth -

[*9515*] I will continue it with your 
permission when you have more time

2 PM Ended & the respondent left -

To continue without interruption this singular 
Narrator I have here, though out of date. entered 
his succeeding apparition -

[?]die 18 Jan. 1857 2.15 PM - Und. Mirror=

Paul de [Clegues?] is here as before.

[*9516*] I was burnt in 1693, in the summer, 
and I have not now progressed beyond 
the state I then found my self in I 
had mistaken the appearances of the
[*158*]

[*9516*]

spirits that came to me upon earth, I 
had given myself up their guidance without 
enquiring to what order they belonged. 
and I found when it was too late that 
I had been encouraging and communing 
with the planetary Spirits, and not with 
those who can direct and counsel to their 
home - I believed from the information 
I received from those that visited me 
that the planets were the abode of men 
after death, that they formed the difft 
degrees and modes of happiness, that 
some were evil and some good, and 
that the greatest felicity was enjoyed by 
those who were allowed to enter the [sun?] 
they never said one word to me of the 
Spheres, I did not know that there was 
a short and direct mode by which I 
could obtain truth and profit by 
it everlastingly, I know now that I 
had the power of exorcising & dispelling 
them if they were not what they 
reported themselves to be - the only Spirits 
of the Universe

I know that I might have 
enquired of them and that they would 
have been bound to answer. me rightly 
but while receiving them and trusting 
implicitly to them. - I lost sight of 
the Being that could alone rule them. 
and of the Name which were they 
falsehood itself in their nature they 
would be defeated and subdued - 
this was caused through my connexion
[*159*]

[*9516*]

with the Catholic religion, I no more believed 
the doctrines I professed, the sanctity of 
vows that I took, than I did in my 
competency to give absolution for money 
or my efficacy in obtaining the intercession 
of Saints that I ridiculed - for those who 
in blind ignorance depended upon me 
- I was soon after death aware of my 
Sin and with a consciousness of all my 
offences with a knowledge of the right 
and a desire to obtain it = and through 
it peace and rest I have remained as 
I died and I am told that it is to the 
mercy of the providence that I blasphemed 
upon earth, I owe even this my present 
position. Sorrowful and Earthbound 
as it is - they tell me that my sufferings 
on earth. and my death by the hand 
of another. prevented me living a sufficient 
time to be repentant, even if I had 
been convinced of my errors - that such 
a conviction might have come before 
my natural life had closed, when 
the giver of it alone thought fit, & 
therefore the punishment that I might 
have expected with Justice had I died 
a natural death was transmitted to 
those who caused my death, that they 
when they deprived me of life took 
upon themselves the whole burthen of 
my Spirit and made me neutral 
neither receiving increasing happiness 
nor any punishment save my own 
Conscience and as I sinned through
[*160*]

[*9516*]

Error in my intercourse with Spirits, I am 
not punished for that because I believed them 
to be the highest - [?] for whom I mistook them 
look upon me with pleasure & with pity, and 
they do all that is possible to keep me from 
falling. a step lower, by their aid I shall be 
enabled to rise gradually to a better state of 
existance, but there is one thing that I want 
out of my possession that I want to [die?] 
back in reality upon earth - before I can rest 
it [must] [it?] be the book that I have treasured 
at all times more than my life, and at 
the last when I am well aware that my 
thoughts should have been directed to a far 
different subject it was my only aim to 
take it with me, and if I could not do that 
to keep it from those who destroyed me - from 
that time to this I have incessantly [?] 
about trying to bring that book back into 
form, before I [?] lose sight of the earth my only 
wish is to see it in material and form as it 
was then that the secrets that caused me 
such trouble to collect should not be lost when 
I was dead even to memory, I have tried to 
show it to men, so wild have been my 
endeavors that I even presented it to 
them while asleep, they have dreamed of it 
and I, oh how hard I have tried to make it 
intelligible to them, when waking has 
dispelled the illusion from their minds & 
I have sought other modes. I have tried 
to present it through writing Mediums but 
they have their other Spirits that low as I 
am I would not dare to mingle with
[*161*]

and be near for I shun their presence with 
as much abhorrence as I look with pleasure 
to the light which comes from those I trust 
may help me, they assure me that the 
more free[r] I can keep my mind from the thoughts 
of earth, from the memory of the past & 
turn them to things above me I may 
hope for readier assistance

I exhorted him to pray for pardon & assistance &c

[*9517*] But I cannot pray sufficiently for Him 
to do so - more I must show with my whole 
being that I am changed - [by] in turning my 
thoughts from earth to heaven I must, 
ask with humility by my actions as well 
as my voice for His grace.

I explained [as to my] that my time being [now] fully occupied 
[that having] recng the CA's [?] [permission I would receive 
his book] [?] as often as possible receive his book, & placing the title 
my Seer had [?], I asked [if he could see it, &] if it 
were correct.

[*9518*] The figures are the same the Spiritual 
Characters are the same

It is the Talisman of the Sun, as 
I thought when I [did] wore it the highest that 
might be made, [and] it is a key to the 
language of all Spirits [?] their Talismans 
that dwell there.

[That is] There is only one class of Spirits 
in the Sun [although 1500 Individuals], 
[?] each has a power peculiarly his own that 
is felt or influences the material world 
this power is obtained & kept up by a 
Talisman which each possesses separate 
and distinct from [the] others & made of
[*162*]

different characters, these characters make a 
language. - [the principal] (sic) that consists 
I may say of 24 letters of the different 
modes of expression, these [letters are] joined 
and shortened, [in the separate Talismans 
it is so,] & there are Conjunctions of Characters 
that look to the uninitiated, of [quite] a 
different description from the 
language of their originals, the one[s] from 
which all their expressions are taken is 
the Talisman of the Sun, the one great 
Talisman that belongs to their abode 
their language you will see in my book

I have for many years been desirous of penetrating 
the Mysteries of the ----- [?] Society of [the] F.R.C. will 
you give me the formula or does your book contain it

[*9519*] It does.

As I have now one hour to spare shall I commence 
with a page or chapter of your MS.

[*9520*] I have not got it with me

I will devote next [?] Evening to receive [it] your book will you then 
bring it

[*9521*] Yes I will

May I ask your age when you thus suffered under 
the tender mercies of the Holy Apostolic Fathers

[*9522*] Forty three.

The many many years that I have passed 
since have made me no older, I would 
that the horrid religion that I professed 
and which destroyed me was swept away 
from the earth, that is priesthood were 
extinguished and that the poor deluded 
wretches they drag after them in their 
mercy were made the partakers of the mercy
[?] to the work in the [?] 
the [?]
[*163*]

of Him they blaspheme

Do you know in your present state any thing of 
the famous Water upon Occult Philosophy. Henry 
Cornelius Agrippa who died in

[*9523*] He is not in my state, he has gone on 
far above me, he was a Christian and a 
student - that was all - I a believer and 
follower.

Do you then think that he did not practise 
magic as well as study it -

[*9524*] he enquire into it = before he could give 
that work - he had a strong tendency 
to spiritualism, and used available means 
to elucidate apparent mysteries, but he 
always undertook the search with a deep 
reverence and a firm reliance on the Almighty 
and a determination to let nothing that 
passed between him and Spirits be they 
what they might, interpose between his 
being and his makers. and never to do 
aught at their instigation other than his 
heart and conscience told him to be 
consistent with the laws of his maker 
manifesting themselves in his being

Did you ever know in the Spirit World Joseph 
Balsamo. Commonly called Count Cagliostro he 
also died under the pious & tender cure of the 
Inquisition in the Castle of St Michael at Rome in 
1793. -

[*9525*] I know he did he was in my state 
indeed worse than mine, worse more 
degraded than I am, and he had made 
sacrifices to his Gods and yet he got on 
before me - I have seen him leave this
Some are interested !!!!
[*162*]

place and go on before me while I remain 
I have seen murderers leave it, and 
I firmly believe if there is a hell, its 
inhabitants are popist priests.

I have often conversed him with, altho a Spirit 
he held Materialistic Views - he has become wiser 
& is now advancing to happiness I hope it will 
be the case with you ere long.

[*9526*] I may be forgiven by Mercy, if not by 
Justice

Did you also know Giuseppe Francesco Borri the 
Milanese, the Author of "La Chiare del [Cabinello?]."

[*9527*] Yes I knew him in my life, there were 
some more even burnt with me Two for 
being heretics & another for witchcraft

I always understood that Priests - who underwent 
the purifying by fire, were strangled at the stake

[*9528*] There were some instances of it, but it 
was not a rule, it is left to the option of 
the Supreme (Judge) the mode of execution 
If he had a purpose to effect - that could 
not be from mercy, that never was a 
part of his nature, he would put them 
out of their misery with a shorter death 
but whenever the torture of "the nails" 
was inflicted it was perfect evidence that 
the extreme would be gone into, and 
instead of the fire being kindled after 
I was bound, it was made first and 
I was then put in and if it had been 
necessary to have been kept in by some 
iron frame work, it would have been 
thrown over and by the fire been made

Would Your Manuscript — and leaving it behind me
when I die — may I not thereby lead some future
possessor into Evils — which he might otherwise have
Escaped.

9531   If a right use were made of it, it would
only lend to enlighten and instruct.

When I complete your manuscript. I shall put
this narrative at the Commencement as well as
introductory Warning against its abuse.

9532   It is not for the making of that book
that I am punished, its for the
reliance I placed upon the Spirits there
treated of , and that not so much by [?]
as for the sins of my profession — they
Constitute my guilt.

Do you know my thing of this MS. — The Key
of Rabbi Solomon on Magic Telisms.

9533   Well you place it closer.
I do know the characters they were
Copied originally from some of the
Rosicrucian Works there's some private
Libraries & MSs. in Rome now that are
Kept quite secret from Strangers to the
order that are full of most curious
Seals and descriptions of Spirits & spirit
places in their own language , you will
find [it] in my book the means of
reading these   each planet had a
separate one , but I knew nothing
of the means of Communication between
Spirits of a higher State. or whether their
modes of expression are the same.

May I ask how you became aware of my
[*167*]

Seers faculty of seeing - & came thus uncalled

[*9534*] You have seen so many Spirits that 
it is pretty well known that you are 
able to communicate with them.

Were you to throw it open to all who 
would come, there would be many and 
of different grades avail themselves of it 
I was not prevented from appearing 
therefore I may say I was allowed to do 
so. - higher Spirits would not begrudge 
me the chance of making myself happier 
when they knew I had the desire to do 
so, they would not close every portal 
against me, and make me an outcast 
from every one. -

Then on [?]die Evening I will await your appearance 

Now he has turned round & walked out.

Can you give me any directions for finding a person

It is an make power that we know nothing 
of until the time of Trial. 
If I meet with such a person will you tell me on what 
Subjects at will be must desirable to solicit information 
9546 
The first subject and the most important 
to be considered is the interest of the soul, 
the most desirable that of obtaining [that] such 
knowledge as may lead to its eternal 
happiness. 
Religion should firm the basis of. 
Your engines for what ever means be decided 
in obtaining Truth and family of pramuples 
and faith shall sinely find favor in 
the sight of Him who can alone make 
Such means surely successful. 
And to understand from your last answer that 
would be wrong to put questions on matters 
which concern my Every day life. 
9547 
Not.—
It is the first duty of a Man to Sick his 
Spiritual welfare—but there are other 
matters that interest him and his happiness 
[to] which he may with safely engine into 
Will you Specify some of these 
9548 
If you have visions of things that are 
Earthly, people that are living, of circumstances

You, the transactions in which you me 
engaged you can ask questions & obtain
information in regard to many of them.
Your own sense of right and justice will
tell you when to cease. --  Your inquiries
into the affairs of these, and those will
well guide you in shining such things
as may appear and tend to lead you
a way that you feel to be wrong.
Am I bound to place implied reliance in all
your communications on points connected with
Religion?
9549
Not unless you are [convinced?] through
your reason, you are not to believe any
thing I say, only because it comes from
me. and through me from a source
that would be otherwise closed to you
but if I place before you such convictions
and theories as seem to you consistent
with each other, and consistent with what
you deem holy, and strong enough in
themselves to supplant your ideas of
Truth with others that are stronger
then you may pray to be lead aught
and rely not on me but on GOD. --
You may believe me - and you will
have faith.

From what source do you derive your own [n??s]
of "Truth" are they intuitive or have they been
communicated to you from birth [only??]
9550
They are derived from [??ledge] & some
conviction but when I communicate with you
I would that you should lose sight of
my spiritual position and argue with
me as man to man.


172  [*5*]

I have made this mirror & ded'd it to you will you
kindly accept the Charge & prevent any Evil spirits
appearing therein, to those having the faculty of
Seeing =

9551     I am pleased that he has one, pleased
that there is a chance of communication
with me -- I will willingly take charge
of it and do all in my power to make
those things seen, good & truthful.

                  Castorias Oval Mirror =
Will you kindly leave this (the C A) Mirror & enter
this mirror ded'd to you --
Now the C A's mirror is clear & this one is veiling  it
is getting very dark indeed -- now theres a ray of
light coming which is gradually dispersing the
darkness. & getting bright all over  the Mirror
Castoria is here.
Will you kindly favor Mr O. with such advice as
you may deem most fitting - in relation to his 
using this mirror.

9502     Mr Ormerod will not be able to see
himself - but he may be able to find
those who can.
     There are many difficulties to contend
with that I cannot remove, and if at
any time that which should appear in 
it should from the description given seem
to him other than good, he must use
his own power of will and exercise to
dismiss them., and not rely upon me
solely.

Will you favor him with your Seal, which he may
place ag't the mirror to assist him when using it
173   [*6*]

9553     I will

Now Castoria has [?]
& Miss Leigh Copied it as opposite
Of what material should the seal be made

9554     Lead and it should be cut by Mr Ormerod

Is it to be place agt. the mirror when calling

9555      Yes.

As Mr O will not be able to see [himself] have you
any other advice to give him for his guidance

9556     It would be best for him to call for
lighter visions than a Spirits presence 
while he is developing the faculties in
any one, if he asks me to show a vision
of persons living, or the likeness of distant
places or Atmospheric Spirits I would
do so when it is convenient & agreeable
to the parties called, this will be better
than soliciting my appearance at once
to those who have never before inspected
the Mirror.

My way when using a C or M for seeing visions
is first to request the Spirit of the C or M to present
any Evil appearing & then [to] request to be allowed
to have certain visions - & then call those visions

9557     That is the best way but when he has
found a person, able to see, I shall always
be ready & most willing to appear
myself and give him any information
he requires.

If Mr. O. finds a person having the faculty of Seeing
Yet not sufficiently developed to see Spirits wd.
You answer Mr O's questions   that would be a
great source of interest

9558     I do not wish questions to be part
174

9558
There is but one Truth, there are different
amounts of knowledge of it = different
grades of knowledge make the higher
and lower Compartment of the spheres, as 
we approach nearer to GOD., to perfection
and Truth. We know more of it and
become higher through that knowledge 
and as we progress we cannot be le[a]d
away from the Truth, it is impossible 
for us to fall into Error., for we have no
temptation, no doubt, no perplexity, no
Contention, and every thing that surrounds
us makes us feel with our whole being
that we are right and progressing towards
a higher state, so that whatever a good
spirit may give be it ever so little that
little is right, and a part of the whole 
that might be given by one of the highest

But does not this very progression of which you
speak imply that the views held by spirits
not in the highest sphere[s] are only partial
developments of truth. - and as such calculated
often to mislead? -

9559
The part of the Truth which they give
they apply to those unto whom it is
given, and do not give any thing that
may tend to mislead, they do not give
part of a complicated whole that is not
perfect unless entire but they give a great
Truth separated and divided in small 
parts and each part is sufficient when
alone to bring about the same end in an
individual sense as the whole.
Thus for instance   The Spirits of
the first
[*175*] [*8*]

[*9559*]

Sphere who are good and in their states 
happy, tell you of the immortality of the 
Soul of its need of a redeemer & Saviour 
and the means by which his intercession 
might be sought with the father, the GOD 
of them and you and nature and all 
things created, but a spirit of the seventh 
sphere can tell you the same and more 
because he could speak of the division of 
the three persons and their unity in one 
GOD. - of the nature of the influence that 
falls from him upon Earth, the merits 
of the Saviour in his eyes, His laws in 
Connexion with nature they can tell of His 
qualities, of His powers immediately acting 
on the Spirit - and of the time too remote 
for the limited faculties of the first (Sphere) 
to punctuate - They can tell of the end

Can you furnish me with any conclusive evidence 
that you are my GS.? at present I have nothing 
beyond your own statement to rely upon -

[*9560*] What evidence would be to you convincing

Make it clear to me that you are acquainted with 
some one fact - connected with my present experience 
which I have never Communicated to any human being

[*9561*] I cannot do it yet, my only means of 
Satisfying you ultimately, if you doubt, 
must be in answering initial questions

If I put a question to you now mentally, would 
you answer it -

[*9562*] I cannot.

The following passage occurs in [?] Garth Wilkinsons 
Life of Swedenborg - p. 225. "The reason of the 
danger of man as at present constituted, speaking with
176
9
Spirits is [Spirits] that are are all in association with
our likes, a being full of Evil _ these Sinister Spirits
could we face them, would but confirm us in our own
State and news, and lend an Authority from whose
Persuasiveness we could hardly escape, to our actual
Evils and falsities , hence for freedoms sake the
strict partition between the worlds"
Is there not some truth in this
9563
Only in the intercourse of Man with Evil
beings — when he associates with those
above him he finds his opinion begins
to change, they never agree with him in
all things , but find in Every man however
Elevated his character — some Errors to
rectify — some things to change . this may
givE proof that it is an intelligence with
which he communes equal if not Superior
to his own. — and that it does not try to
delude him by agreeing with & flattering
his limited and Earthboudn views.
HavE you any advice to givE me on any Subject
9564
You must take care of it — be earnest
in your entreaties for the advancement of
Your Spiritual and temporal welfare.
but most especially for the safety & [happine??]
of your after life., always holding in
sight and remembering that the duration
of mortality is in time— but that of
Immortality in Eternity and throughout
Space — and opposing with a firm will

tendency and you will with the favor 
of His countenance upon you surmount 
the manifold obstacles that rise towering 
their gigantic heads in that path which 
man must tread, and passing from the 
contemplation of material and its confines 
to the boundaries of the world of Spirits 
and through it to the knowledge of GOD.

Mr O returned thanks.

Will you request Pure to appear in the CA Mirror

22' to 10 PM

Invoked Pure

He is here very light hair rather golden, very fair 
complexion, no wings, girdle of stones round 
the waist - and I can see his feet.

Are you the GS. of Mr Walter Moseley

[*9566*] Yes

Please to show.

[*9567*] A3

May I ask the meaning

[*9568*] I am of the 3rd Sphere

Am I right in preparing this mirror which I have 
dedicated to you - for Mr Moseley

[*9569*] You do no wrong if at the same time 
you give him the means by which he 
may guard them from evil if he will

May I request you to pass into this mirror 
which I have dedicated to you and assume 
its charge
[*178*]

[*11*]

PURE's Mirror

Pure is here but it is still misty over the lower part.

Will you favor Mr M. with your seal that he may 
place agt. the mirror when invoking

[*9570*] I have no other than the one I wear.

Will you give him such instructions as you may 
deem best for his using this mirror.

[*9571*] The most safe and effective way is to call 
only for that. - that is right and proper & 
use the name of God in that calling 
and to determine that nothing he may 
call or desire shall be other than that 
which he believes in humility will meet 
His sanction - he must use a strong 
exorcism and dismissal

At what hours or time should Mr M use this 
mirror to develop his faculty of seeing

[*9572*] He had better look himself as often 
as he can, and make it a practice of 
doing so on Thursdays.

At any special hour.

[*9573*] It would be best to look at night at 
9 oclock. until his vision is sufficiently 
clear for him to read, and then other 
arrangements may be made

Were you of the 3rd Sphere when I called you 
before some months since

[*9574*] No answer

have you any objection to answer that question

[*9575*] I have. you may be satisfied from 
my position in the 3rd Sphere that I 
am good, my power is limited but all 
that I possess I am willing and 
desirous to use for the furtherance of
[*179*]

[*12*]

good ends, and the strengthening of 
good purposes

If Mr Moseley wishes for any further instructions 
thro me. will you appear in my crystal when 
called.

[*9576*] I would rather appear in the mirror 
you have like this - I am quite willing 
to do so.

As Mr Moseley is not here, personally may I ask 
if you have any further advice to give him

[*9577*] Mr Moseley in person is very susceptible 
of spiritual influence - when he takes to 
this means of communication with us, it 
will be very desirable for him to terminate 
all other modes of communion and keep 
himself only to this one.

Will you also take charge of his crystal

[*9578*] I will

I returned thanks

surprize that altho burnt in 1693 he is now 164 
years afterwards in the same spiritual state can 
that be really so

[*2642 9579*] Yes indeed it is unfortunately true, but still 
low as his state is he may be trusted
[*180*]

but it is not what he has been but what he 
is you must consider, and now he has the 
feelings and perceptions of right that will 
make him fit for another state

I advised him to pray &c in that I could not do 
wrong

[*2643 9580*] You cannot it is but a repetition of advice 
given him by all with whom he associates.

If any &c

[*2644 9581*] I have not for it is needless for me to repeat 
that I am certain after receiving a book 
such as he may give you containing 
many curious and mixed and powerful 
things that you will make any use at 
all improper of it, and I should advise 
you not to show it to many, only those 
you feel can receive it in the same manner

[*2647 9584*] Yes I will

Can you appear on any day of the week except

P. de C. is here

Have you any thing you wish to remark before we 
commence transcribing the book

[*9586*] I will fetch it

Now he has walked out at the back of the Mirror 
in 2' he came back with it.

Will you tell me how to regulate my proceedings

[*9587*] I will open it and place it before you

Now he has opened the book and the page is covered 
all over with characters

[*9588*]

Language 
of the Spirits of the Sun 
by which may be decyphered the Talismans 
that have been received at all periods 
from them, and showing their means of 
communication in their own sphere 
together with 
their Talmudonic or their Laws and 
Regulations

My seer then commenced transcribing the characters but 
as they were all cabalistic & in various colors and 
combinations with explanation under it occupied 
much time, and I asked if the colors had any
182 
Spiritual or Essential Signification of were merely the 
result of his own fancy or taste. 

9589   There are 4 colors that are described at 
the bottom of the page. 

May I ask of how many pages your book is 
Composed  _ 80 _

I explained why we could not continue transcribing 
any longer and promised, to do so at the past opp'y.

May. I request you to complete your quotation of the 
5 first verses of St.  John Ch. XVII. I   shoud value it 
so highly Coming from such a source 

2649   9591    Certainly I mentioned it to you last

wished to finish the bottom of the page before

I regret to hear but my Seer & I are equaly desirous
of seeing my friend Lea.  We shall therefore be pleased
to see Ellermo to receive any instructions for his guidance

2651   9593   I think it would be best for you to call
him -- he has an objection to appear without

I have nothing more.

Invoked Eltesmo.

2' he is here as before.

I explained the CA's remark.

[*9595*] I ask you when you can do so to go and 
see him I am not able to communicate 
with him freely, I cannot take possession 
of his mind, so as to propose to him my 
desires and my plans, I cannot be in 
Harmony with him, his nature repels 
me - I am very willing to be of service 
to him. but I cannot be, for we are 
too far apart.

I explained at length my wishes for his Success 
among his earnest desire, & that it would be a great 
source of happiness to him & his wife

[*9596*] I will appear to you if you will call 
me before you intend going to see him 
and then I will use all my power 
exert all my influence to appear plain 
and to communicate with him and if 
after that I cannot succeed - painful 
as it is to me - I must change, for I 
must not by close adherence feel too 
strongly for and love too well that 
which I cannot raise to me. for I 
would not lower myself to that.

If I can go on Friday week I will request your
[*184*]

appearance on the Tuesday previous does that meet 
your wishes

[*9597*] It does I thank you

If any &c

[*9598*] I have not.

P. de C. is here he has opened the book and turned it 
round. 

have you any thing you wish to communicate before my 
seer commences copying

[*9599*] I have not.

My seer then finished the page - and I explained 
my intention of [?] copying it as much as possible 
like his original - in india Ink first

[*9600*] It shall be so

The colors can easily be done afterwards

May I ask in what way you pass your state 
of Being or Time if I may so express it.

[*9601*] I can not above the limits of Sight 
from the Earth, therefore any time is 
much occupied in watching its movements 
and moving and acting with those 
on a level with me and meeting & communing 
with those who come down or go up 
asking them questions and receiving replies 
as they pass, and I seek to know 
how far true the things were that I 
sought and received while living

I still adhere to the same studies 
and love to contemplate more than any 
thing else the Laws that now, as then
185
Remain hidden to me. — The Mysteries
of other beings and places that I may
or may not go into ultimately — and
I try my best to inform my self, for
I do those things which the beings superior
to myself tell me ought to be done, and
teach me how to do . them.
I Explained my attachment to Occult Subjects &
Asked his Opinion of Alchemy , the Great work &
the [?] .
9602
I am told now that Substances may
be procured and preparations made from
them sufficiently resembling [them]
Gold as to pass for it, without discovery
but taht the nature of baser metals is
never Changed and tho' colored and
altered they shall remains base though
Answering every purpose of Gold. the
resemblance can be made as close as
paste to diamonds , there is no doubt
about that .
but thought it is a deception it
would provE valuable to all the world
and would hurt no one, for it is not

CA Mirror

Invoked the CA

5' past 8.

I mentioned my Views as to the CA's metaphysical 
Work. just completed

[*2653 9606*] It would be best not to publish it yet 
circumstances may occur when it can 
be placed in a different light, and call 
for more attention, and have more weight 
with those who read it than it would 
now. for now work is complete when 
there is the possibility of receiving additions

And when I gave it you it was for 
yourself - to elucidate to you my theories 
- a token of my Esteem, and I feel 
that as it is now, it is unfit to be sent 
forth. for the perusal of all who may 
think it worth their notice, for while 
I advocate most strongly every doctrine 
that it contains and earnestly desire to 
see them wide & far spread yet I 
think that at present it would be best 
kept back - for to strangers, its coming 
from a Source so utterly beyond their
[*187*]

comprehension it would be either ridiculed 
as an imposition or scowled at as one 
of the Machinations of Evil and by few 
very few received as it is sent.

I cannot sufficiently thank you for your past 
favors - yet I feel now Emboldened to solicit at 
your hands a treatise on the progress of Knowledge 
thro' the Seven Spheres the heads of which you 
have given in the concluding pages of your work 
and which appear to unfold the whole doctrine 
of Christianity -

[*2654 9607*] It is so all those Spaces are filled 
up with the Knowledge of the True 
religion - would it not seem to you 
but a repetition were I to give you 
complete though in different form 
the answers that I have given to your 
questions on that Subject.

On the contrary my questions have been unconnected 
or rather - disjointed - and I should much covet 
to receive your views in a connected form. 

[*2655 9608*] If you are willing to receive it it is 
at your Service

Will it be in the form of a book as before

[*2656 9609*] Yes

Shall I look forward to commence it next Tuesday

[*2657 9610*] Not next Tuesday Evening 
I will give it you on this day 3 weeks

May I be allowed to ask if your quotation of 
XVII John v 1-5 was made from a copy existing in 
the Spirit World as I perceive that altho - "Life 
Everlasting" is implied "The Word" in our translations 
it does not occur till verses. 6 and 8.

[*2658 9671*] Only those parts exist of the New Testament
[*188*]

that the words of Jesus Christ are in the 
actual words used by him without alteration 
or comment. And they are united with 
the history of his life his beginning and his 
End.

You will perceive that the concluding portion of the 
second verse in all these Translations [the] is 
"That he should give Eternal life to as many as 
"thou hast given him". & then & "This is life Eternal" 
Commencing the 3rd Verse. - it is not until the end 
of the 6th Verse that Jesus says # "And they have kept they Word - in your translation it is rendered 
"That he may give Eternal life unto all who 
may receive they Word - this is life Eternal". may 
I ask your opinion upon the two renderings

[*2659 9612*] That it is a mistake but whether in the 
Original Copy or the translations I am 
not certain the meaning is kept the 
same but the words of Jesus Christ 
were more concise & shorter in many 
instances than the received version of 
them.

Could I be favored by your Spiritual Version of 
the words of our Lord being rendered into English

[*2660 9613*] I could give them to you but I must 
mention that the printed version existing 
now of his words is accurate in meaning 
and sufficient to effect the purpose 
for which they were uttered

Because the word is now of as 
much value as when it was uttered 
and he who gave still preserves it. 
and in it there is all that is necessary 
for mans guidance although not all 
[*189*]

that he really spoke for he spoke much 
upon the earth that [he] did not concern 
men, and communed often with his own 
Spirit

I am unfortunately prevented seeing my friend 
Lea as I anticipated I will therefore not call 
Eltesmo this Evening as I proposed

[*2661 9614*] I will inform him

Mr Brown of Nottingham has published this 
diagram of the Seven Spheres of [?] from 
the same planetary spirits whom I formerly 
evoked.

[*2662 9615*] He is [much] in error and much mistaken 
It is planetary spirits above that he 
sees, or communicates with him and 
they tell him of their own spheres, he 
does not enquire deep enough or he would 
find that the soul of man takes no 
part and occupies no place in that 
plan

They alone live in it who give it and 
they are purely spiritual - and then 
it is not correct because there are no 
boundaries of darkness and light round 
the planets, there are seven circles 
and each confines a number of beings 
from the space beyond

As I am informed I believe Mr Brown to be a very 
truthful & sincere man but owing to his using 
the old magical MS formulas - he invokes the 
planetary spirits only - would it be advisable 
for me to write to him upon the subject

[*2663 9616*] You might send him a letter without 
mixing with him and his spirits
[*190*]

intimately and let it end there or if 
you like I would send a communication 
in your letter.

I replied in the affirmative

[*2664 9617*] I will do so I will give it to you next 
Tuesday - If it will be convenient for 
you to introduce it to him then.

I thank you.

Robert Owen. in returning my last vol of MS notes 
begs me to thank you for him & to state that he 
has perused your responses with increased interest 
& hope to send your last Work. I trust it may 
be beneficial to him.

[*2665 9618*] I trust it may

Altho in his 86th year he is working away at 
his memoirs & looks forward hopefully to anr. 
meeting on the 14th next May.

[*2666 9619*] however erroneous his Convictions may 
be they must be looked upon with 
indulgence, for none be they what they 
may can feel other than the higher 
regard for one who has so earnestly 
worked to do good.

He has the happiness of an 
approving conscience

If any &c - & if we could see Mr Anderson this 
Evening

[*2667 9620*] I think you had better call him this 
Evening as you are disengaged - for 
he thinks that you neglect him

Shall it be in this or the Oval Mirror

[*2668 9621*] he will appear in either

Called Mr Anderson 
he is here in blue coat buttoned up but looking very cold
 
9622 
I am glad to see you again 

how have you been since we last saw you 

9623 
The cold of this wretched climate completely 
Knocks me up I hope you are quite 
well—and Miss—

Yes and “Miss” is here very busy with his needlework 
cannot you see her 

9624 
I do

how are you getting in with your Spiritualism 
any thing very interesting 

9625 
Nothing particularly So, have you? 
I have looked regularly and have mostly 
seen the same spirits, and have recd
information on very many subjects 
have you seen Sevenomina or Ellessmo 
Since I saw you last. 
Yes and Ellesmo is now the GS. of my friend Lea 
and Sevenomina of [D]K. Mackenzie
 
9626 
That is very strange 

I mentioned at length the apparition of N del 
the Spanish Friar= 

9627 
What a very singular and interesting 
Narrative - I should like to see it 
much and I should think it would 
prove one of the most remarkable 
you have Ever received if you complete 
it. 
What is his name

D the C.

8/126 
It is a french not a Spanish name

Can you see the Title which my seer Miss Emma
192

has copied & coloured for me

9629
Yes thank you

I then showed him the first page

9630
Yes there are many cabalistical characters
like them in old Spanish Mfs. but it
strikes me that it is also the signs
and figures used by the Rosicrucians
- that's what it will end in

Yes he stated that he learnt their ceremonies &
passwords - which he is going to communicate

9631
because some of those characters are
the same as those on the badges given
to the members of the Secret Societies
in Spain. when they are admitted to
the brotherhood and a ceremony is gone
through of which they form part

It is strange that his attachment to this
Subject should for so long a period have
hindered his rising in the Spirit world

9632
do you think that is the only reason
that keeps him from progressing

No he states the Chief cause was his hypocrisy
as a Roman Catholic priest.

9633
I have completely parted with every
remnant of the Catholic faith - I too
can see now its bigotry, its ambition
and its sin.

I hope you do not include the Divinity + divine
[champion?] of J.C.

9634
No. but I look upon him far differently
from what I did when I believed in
the power of the Church + its priesthood
and I find that as the religion gets
more simple it brings one nearer the
193

Truth - nearer GOD and that divested
of all forms & ceremonies, all priestly
Mediators and intercessors the worship
of the Soul is more acceptable to Him

Altho' the CA's work on metaphysics is now
Completed I think from the concluding portion
I shall be favored with another work.

9635
he has an end in view in doing so 
I have no doubt - how much space 
does this one occupy as much as the 
other.

I think about 60 pages [8ro?]

9636
what printed

Yes did you get a copy of "Echo" as you promised

9637
Yes and I bought the two works
of G.R. the one before yours and the 
one after so that I invested more
them a [1/2?].

I have recd an explanation of the divisions of 
Knowledge in the 7 Spheres - I will read it if you 
please

9638
I should like to hear them much
 
I read the 35. Sections

9639
What a field that lays open for 
further information 
I thank you I think by following 
up the heads of the [?] of the 
Spheres there given you you would
have another part of the work of 
greater value and of Equal Size.

I am to have it continued on the last [symbol for Mars] die
in February.

9640
Then I should have them all three
bound in one and cut out the vision
194
that you have in the first part
I intend recopying it with only a preface
9641
I should because as the vision was
givEn before the work was commenced
it may have only been to show you
the formation of matter and Spirit, and
its separation for that is what it seems
to be, and there the book to [me?] seems
to explain the purpose for which they
were both made and the [?]
object of the Creator [?] making the
Invisible rule the Visible body.
Have you received my books in that way
9642
No I have not. long responses that's all
I should like to receivE one on [?]
own state and their own world. if there
was a possibility of their giving it
a description that would meet my
Understanding
Why do you not ask [E????] he has offered to
givE me some Spiritual [?], ^ to give Mr Lea
a work Entitled "the past and the future"
9643
I will
do you know "W.H." yet.
96214
I have nothing to dow with him, I never
saw him in my lie , from his appce.
in the Crystal I have no great desire
to become acquainted with him
how is your friend Mr Hamilton getting in
9645
WE are not very intimate—, I seldom
hear from him — Still the acquantance
is kept up.

No

I shall be delighted to look in and

how’s your little friend—I have 
Seen the little man three or four times 
he’s come into my little crystal with 
a bag load of books, and told me he 
Was going to see you, but that he 
didnt expect he was wanted. 
You have not kept your promise by telling me 
your name yet 
9648 
It’s of no use for you to know 
Well I am content to remain in ignorance 
9649 
When its bless, its folly to be wise 
Are you in England 
9650 
Yes I am in active Since how 
have you read “Ashology, as it is” by a corralry

I like him much. 
its getting late What time is it by your. 
9653

[?] 10 Feb. 1857  C A Mirror
10' past 8PM Smoked the CA
In your metaphysical work you mention at the final
End of all things - the Sun + planetary bodies falling
to the earth. sun as 4 is times larger than the
Earth + the O is estimated to be times longer
it appears incongruous that such rash bodies shall
fall into it + be swallowed up or amalgamated with 
one so infinitely less 

2669
9656
I am quite aware that they seem
insurmountable objections but the nature
of the sun and the planets is so diffr.
to that of the earth., that while the 
earth being split up dissolves and becomes
an immense floating liquified Mass.
the O an aerial body of light purely 
spiritual could collapse or come down
in a sheam when its light was no
longer necessary in its place., You
who are on the earth cannot see 
the difference on the appearance 
of the two but believe that to be as a
planet of the same system but it is
not so to us who look from our
place at the whole of the universe and 
see the system working perfectly at
once - the earth looks dark, its
atmosphere is black compared to
that of the other bodies, and its
weight and solidity is immense


Of the Nature of the Sun as luminous body
Astronomers have as yet no fixed theory. 
197
2670
9657
They are filled with low Spirits, they
have no material bodies in them, It is
impossible for [?] to look at the planets
in the same light as you do , they seem
so wonderful to Man because they
are the only things that he can see
that he cannot comprehend of the
much greater magnitude & immensity of
all that is beyond them or between
them and him he does not know.
If at a future time I place a diagram of our
Solar System as known to Astronomers will
You favor me with your views
2671
9650
I will give you my opinion of them
And if you like I will give you the
plan as they appear
I think you can I have it next Tuesday Evening

You can have it now
Miss E. Leigh then said here is a great [?] of white

I thank you I will resume the subject on next

As I intend going to Mr Lea's on [symbol for Venus] die, I will
with your consent Call Ellesmo this Evening to favor
me with his advice -.

9668
I promised You this Evening the letter
to Mr Brown of Nottingham 
Shall I give it you

I shall receive it with great pleasure.

[Six?]
2682
9669
If the address of a Stranger the the inhabtt
of another world and the partaker of 
another life, needs any apology I
must offer the following - I respect 
your works and admire your manly
candour in publishing + upholding
that which you deem right though 
opposed to the generality of mens 
good opinions and without [???ing]
at pecuniary advantage - and Sincerely 
believing that you do it with a firm
conviction of its Truth. and tendency
199
9669
and tendency towards the improvEment
of those who may read, I deem it a
duty not only that one man [?] to.
another but of every Created being
possessing intelligence to correct as [f??]
as his powers would permit him
the errors taht are unconsciously committed
by those who seek to do well.
In your writings , I have found
errors taht prove a Stumbling block
in the right path , and that are
Calculated to lead most woEfully [?]
All who may place dependance upon
them and upon your System of spiritual
investigation, in all good will - I will
point them out to you and if I fail
in producing the desired Effect[s]—
that of Changing your mode of
operation , attribute it to my weakness
and not to the fallacy of my cause.
if any man occupies his time
and devotes his attention to any Study
or occupation that brings into the Arena
Spirits — beings over whom he has no
control and whose nature is to him
Even now unfathomable mystery, he
allows himself to Mi[[?]]ngle with them
And Converse with them— he should
be solely guided and governed by
one [?] ., . and whatever be the nature
of their intercourse that Law should
never be broken — he should seek
the Countenance and favor of Almighty
GOD. and He alone in his undertaking
200
and make a prayer for assistance
and protection secondary to nothing
simple as the desire may be for His
help, it shall go home to its source
and all that is done with this preface
shall be right. If man by his actions
determines to follow out his thoughts
and all that done without it shall
inevitably lead to ruin --
     There is no need of any formula
used by old magicians,  there is no
need of using any names, for when
the voice of man is unheard by His
Maker, the mediation of no spirit
can effect its purpose, there needs
no intercessor for a spontaneous
prayer. how earnest that prayer ought
to be the mighty importance of that
which it asks for shall determine
for it must ever be borne in mind that
those you ask to see,  are now what
you will be -- that their state shall
be your state [that] their teaching their
words . [Their]  have [?] sufficient influence over
your friend as to lead you into the
depths of misery or the perfection of
happiness and that not in the
corporeal body but in the Eternity of 
the Soul, and therefore the vital interest
of the immortal spirit depends upon
the earnest entreaty with which you
ask of Him and Him alone who
is able to give it - for the Shield and
weapon of defense that shall arm
201
9669
You against the [s????s] & machinations
of vil and the treachery of deceit —
Having done this, I say again
without the magicians formula, for the
intercourse of man with Spirits is not
Magic — granted that it is as yet
to you a hidden Lair of Nature , but
it is a law of Nature still and it is
not impenetrable — for when man is
prepared to do the one thing requisite
and necessary the barrier shall be broken
down and the Spirit out of the
Flesh be as well known and as
easily communicated with as taht which
is encased in the Corporeal body — Man's
Mind—
Having placed yourself under
the eye of natures' GOD and divested
Yourself of all undue power that may
have been exercised over you by those
with whom you now comunicate and
having made yourself free by your will
to reason calmly and receive without
[?] [?] all that is laid before you, you
will find the knowledge you then
attain for different from what you
receivE at present . and the [???port] of
their Conversation. will show you that
you take a position scarcely below
them and make you individually
and your interest and welfare [?]
and hereafter their object and study
You will find that betwEEn GOD and
Man begining with he one as the
202

9669
Highest and ending with the other as the
farthest off are seven gradations of being
[and] [under] each progressing towards the
greater perfection of knowledge possessed
by the one above him and each ever ready
and always anxious to give unto him that
is below the benefit of his own position
and the knowledge that he has obtained
how to be greater and better, how to be
nearer the perfection of all things that
is above him - and all of them looking
to Man as to themselves because they
know that he shall here after be a partaker
of their destiny, a sharer of their happiness
an inhabitant of their own home
Their beings are not bound by any
limit save their own grades of knowledge
they have existed since He existed from
whence they sprang and they shall
exist pure and perfect when the human
is destroyed and nothing but the
Immortal Soul of Man in the presence
of its maker in company with them
for all eternity
These are the Spirits of the Seven
Spheres and the only Spheres that
have any connection or ought to have
any connection with Man. - If he
desires that which is right, and desires
the favor of the Almighty these are to 
him the only ones, and by the beings
that inhabit them shall he alone be
taught the means of progressing through
their states after death. and being
203

9669
with them of their body, and of their
Nature when the Son and the Moon
and the Stars are no longer in existence
and their inhabitants are come out of
them and changed. - Then shall they
too find that they cannot retrieve the
errors they have committed by interfering
with Man and laying before him the
plan of their own abode and their
different grades of Knowledge and the
limits in which they are confined by
telling him that they are spheres
- so they are to them. but they have
nothing to do with Man, they are
not his spheres, he will never go
into them if he does what is right
and escape punishment - and they
will have nothing to do with him
individually if he does not desire it -
and use this precaution of avoiding
them.
Granted that they are not Evil, that
they can withstand exorcism that they
appear of pleasing form and that
what they say is true it is none the
less Evil to Man. because by listening
to them he is led out of the right path
and his attention is led to things
of more absorbing interest perhaps
because more closely allied to his
Earthly propensities and gratifications
than that coming from a pure source
which asks only to be heard by him
his reason only to be confirmed by his
own conscientious conviction, be assured
204

by his own conscience that he has
trusted to his GOD and then only
offers that wealth and honor & glory
shall be put up for him in heaven [*1*]
by every service it can render and every
word that it can teach and with
those words gives the price with which
he may buy a mansion in his fathers
house.

2683
9670
This is the principal part of what
I wish to say leaving it to you to
make such alterations as you may
think necessary and any additions
which you may wish to make., only
mentioning that it comes from one
who is an inhabitant of the right
Sphere. - I do not wish my name
to it because I have an objection to
being called by Mr Brown at present

The CA left

25' to 11 PM. . Invoked [Eltesmo?]
I explained my intentions as to giving to Mr Lea's on
[symbol for Venus]die requested my advice &c

9671
I am only desirous that you should
call me that I may have an opportunity
of responding to a Call  earnest and firm -
and I will try with every Effort to
make my self plain and my language
intelligible, for I would most willingly
be to Mr Lea what a Guardian Spirit
should, and I cannot fulfill the duties
205

satisfactorily until I have impressed
upon his mind the urgent necessity
of a still greater change in his opinion
on religion

I will [all] do all in power to meet your views

Requested [P de C?] to furnish us with the book &
Immediately the Mirror veiled - & the book appeared

page. & Miss Emma Leigh copied a portion until
1/2 past 4 PM.

♂︎ die 17 Feb. 1857 CA Mirror
               Invoked the CA.
I read to the CA my letter to Mr Brown to accompany
the CA's address I asked his opinion

2684   9673   You have done right, that is all that
is necessary and all that you can
do

Am I right in concluding that next Tuesday I
am to commence receiving your promised work

2685   9674   Yes

May I ask if you have any Communication to make
as to my receiving the book

2686   9675   You will receive it in the same manner
that you did the former one
I will do all that I can to make
it plain and speedy in coming but I
cannot ensure its coming always
alike as that depends upon circumstance,
206

with which I am not connected

I have before me Swedenborgs Arcana Cœlestia & I
observe that in many points his assertions coincide
strictly with yours in others they as completely vary
are you aware of that's being the case

2687
9676
Yes
The reasons why some parts of his work
is correct and others erroneous is because
gaining his knowledge from Spiritual
[sources] instruction and communication
and mixing with them unreservedly
he communed with all souls and of all
grades, and receiving from each their
separate opinions he was sometimes
well taught and sometimes deceived

I read Genesis 1.26. and Swdenborgs - comment
No 50 A.C. & also Swedenborgs doctrine of Correspondences
I asked the CA's views

9677
2688
doubtless there is a hidden meaning to
many, very many passages in the Bible
especially in the New Testament and
the most simple are in many cases fraught
with much spiritual [light] weight and
Swedenborg through his communion with
Spirits and his vivid and peculiar
Spiritual light, had his perceptions
very acute and penetrated deeper than
other Men into the subject he turned
his attention to, but when receiving
their aid, he received their individual
opinions and many of these explanations
of Bible verses are theirs, so that he
goes too far and mingles Errors with
Truth. by giving a meaning to each
207
verse which only a few have attached
to them, a comparative few., he is right
in the one concerning Adam and Eve and
he is right when he speaks of the two
opponents influencing Man, the one to
good and the other to Evil - but he is
wrong when he makes those opponents
extempore influences, for they are separate
and distinct from his Guardian Spirit
or Evil Spirit that may be attached to
him for the good and Evil that he speaks
of is that which is inherent in Man's
nature and can be strengthened or Subdued
by him and over which he has sole
command.

I  read the paragraph page 36 of Whites life of Swedenborg
[Co????]. "The Arcana Cœlestia is an Exposition &c to the last
paraph. page. 39.  I also read Swedenborgs Comment
or Exposition on Gen.1.v26. No50 AC.

2689
9679
In the first place regeneration is not of
Earth, it cannot take place while the
spirit and the material are joined -
and also it is unnecessary to mans
material existence that there should be
any beings between himself and GOD -
He alone is the giver of life, and the upholder
of it., and if it be taken except by his
means it is a crime punishable hereafter
and again Man has not 4 spirits
attached to him, there are such cases
but they are uncommon & for a special
purpose - the spirits of either good or
Evil do not make man partakers of
their nature, therefore strictly speaking
208
9679
speaking they neither bring to God nor
lead him to destruction , and viewing it
in this way no being whatever stands
between God and man, the Spirit encased
in the one and the spirit free and perfect
in the other — but the grades that are
between the two have an indirect influence
and also those that are beneath man
for they each side with the two propensities
of his nature, the one suggests to the
mind of man, that is the part that is
most near to his own being & possesses
the highest and consequently the nearest
approach to his quality — such things
alone as shall improve it and make
it better and nearer perfection & shall
by its instigation and incessant watching
strengthen the [?] and consciousness if
of right — and make it stand out in
separate and distinct colors from wrong
and that on the other hand those
beneath Man approach him & tempt
him through the medium of the flesh
they appeal strongly to his desires
and his appetites and his corporeal
feelings , but they never , they dare not
place their temptations in any but its
true shape, and if the temptation they
offer is stronger than man can resist
he never falls into their snares believing
them to be right or feeling a conviction
of their Truth , he does it knowingly &
only because the spirit is weaker than
the flesh. The carnal world has more
          interest them the immortal [?]. [*209*]
I read AC 444 + 445
               [?] may have [conversed?] with 
               the spirits of deceased mortals, and 
               they are truly after death the same as in life 
2490      unless they pass upwards to a higher 
2680      State, the opinions arrived at on earth
               still adhere to there, and the state
               they are in shows the falsity of such 
               opinions - so that from there he gained
               nothing.
I read AC 448
2491 [?]681  It is correct 
I read AC 459.
               That is not right, Every good Spirit 
               is an Angel and of course every Angel 
2492      is a spirit 
9682           If he calls the spheres heavens 
               these seven instead of three, and the 
               different degrees of their inhabitants  
               is attained by their own merits of
               discerning the truth and of upholding
               it with then strength. and exerting
               themselves to do good by promulgating
               it. 
                    Certainly each as he gets higher
               has greater faith but is only because 
               he has [?] of knowledge.
M [Kenyie?] has sent me word that on
when working by the [DA?] - it became suddenly 
quite dark & rocked to and fro even
after M placed his hand upon it - & so terrified
his Young Seer that [? M.] was obliged to
discontinue the action - may I ask the [same?]
210

2693
9683
Probably some of the spirits he has mixed
with at another time -

on [Venus sign] die last Ellesmo promised to favor me
with a seal for Mrs. Lea's new Mirror will you
request him to appear .

2694
9684
I was not aware of Ellesmo's desire
to appear this evening but I will 
request him to do so. 

If may &c

2695 
9685 
I have nothing

25 past 9 PM
1/2 past 9 Invoked Ellesmo
2' he is here

I mentd. his promise as to the Seal. 

9686 
I certainly think a Seal would be
serviceable for M Lea's use, particularly
at a future time - 
   When his Seer could read at all
it would make it more distinct and
hasten its appearance, but if she 
cannot read, it would not cause
reading to appear.

But his seer can read. I did on Tuesday read 
all there responses.

9687 
I meant at times on special evenings
sometimes no reading would appear 
and then this seal would not induce
it to do so - and her visions may vary
but if she sees reading at all, that 
reading would be made more legible
by the are of the Seal.

I presume you give the whole of these responses

9688
Yes.
211
Will you favor me with the Seal

                                      Croydon	
♀ Feb. 20. 1857         C A Mirror
                  Invoked [the CA]
                                 Seven-o-mina
20' to 8.
Sevenomina is here as before


I have called you first into this Mirror having perfect
reliance that evil spirits or deluders cannot enter it. May
I ask you some questions in it

9692   I can answer your questions here unreservedly
because I am free from the interruption of
other spirits

Mr Kenneth MacKenzie has favored me with a visit.
this Ev'g and at his request I have prepared this mirror
and ded'd it to you will you accept the Charge.  and
prevent any evil spirits from appearing therein when
MM is calling
2

9693   I will and guard and protect it to the
best of my ability so long as he shall aid
me by determining to use it for no bad or
weak purpose.

I have prepared it according to your instructions. I
hope it meets your views

9694    It does.

Dr M informed me by letter that "A few ☉dies since he
was invoking by the O.B. having a little lad as Seer
when the O.B. become unusually dark so that the
boy got terrified and then asked if M M was shaking
the Table. he replied no — the boy replied   look at the
bottle. & when Mr M did so it was swaying from
side to side & upon his touching it  it continued to
tremble and oscillate under his hand — upon which
he discontinued the action (see D M's letter 16/2/57

9695    I am not aware of that particular circumstance
but I know that the Spirits with whom he
associated at Mr Crosrands house, still strive
to adhere to him and seek eagerly for any
opportunity of manifesting themselves to him
They may easily be told by the means they
use.

I placed the seal against the Mirror & requested
S.O.M. to verify it — Miss Leigh said "he is looking at it

9696   It is done — and so long as he opposes them
with a firm will and discontinues his invocat'n
and his use of that in which they appear
or the medium by which they manifest themselves
he will succeed in dispelling them, and in
any case they cannot harm him or even annoy
him if he does not encourage them.

If I now invoke you in this mirror will you
kindly appear in it

9697    I will do so.
3
                                  Seven o Mina's Mirror 
7.58     Invoked Seven o mina to appear.
2' now he is here. (as in the CA)

9698   I wish D MacKenzie to look in this Mirror
now and try if he can see a change.

Mr M accordingly took Miss Leigh's hand & inspected
the only perceptible Change was the darkening of
the Mirror at intervals

9699    do you see any difference

Mr M explained and I said in accordance to a
rule I worked by.  I must beg SOM to answer a few
questions
May I ask your Name

9700    Seven-o-mina
Are you the GS. of Kenneth RH MacKenzie

9701    I am

Will you show &c

9702    A A

Ex'd 3 times, May I again ask if you will take charge
of this Mirror & by what name or term it shall be
known.

9703    The S-O-M.

Will you now favor Mr M with any instructions as
to using the Mirror & the days you prefer appearing

9704    Fridays will be the best day for seeing
but he can use it at any time to develope
his faculty even if it be for 5 minutes from
that to 1/2 an hour, a steam or mist as it
were over the glass will be the first sign
of my attention, and as this thickens it
will penetrate deeper into the Spirit World
and make a channel for my appearance
and when in the midst of this a bright spot
appears, a star of light  it shall be the signal
of my visible presence and after that I
4
I shall become gradually plainer

May not Mr M call for visions of absent friends
and distant places while it is developing

9705   Not in this, I thought it would some time
back but I find now more precaution is
necessary — if he wishes to try the sight of any
other person  he can call such [?] of
Visions, but not when he is alone trying to
improve his own.

I promise then when invocating he had better wait
your appearance

9706   he had.

May I as a favor ask. .if you can tell me any thing
that will do my Seers throat good, she is now
suffering much pain from speaking so long

9707   (No answer)

Why do you say — Yes or No —

[?]      , No answer.,

With your permission Mr M. will take possession
of this Mirror & in future propose his own questions

KM  explained the difficulty there was in convincing 
Sceptics by other than physical means, under
such circumstances was it not admirable to permit
them to witness rapping phenomena, for at any
rate it was convincing to them of spiritual agency
If it be impossible to assail them in any other way
is it not right to adopt this course.

9708   decidedly it is not.
because by so doing you are opening the way 
to the greatest errors that then can be led
into, that is paving their path to destruct'n
for in most casts, perfect sceptics after being
 convinced of a new thing, become its firmest
upholders and you must consider that the
5
beings with whom you sanction their
Communion are stronger and better armed
than they, and are fighting for a cause with
every weapon they possess, of which every 
individual they influence and associate 
with they complete the Victory -

9708  You are degrading humanity and making
the Evil worse than it is -
    It is a Sin against the Almighty Power
of God for you are advocating & promulgat'g
the knowledge of the power that shall surely
lead his people from him -  You are 
doing what you know to be wrong, for you
are teaching others to do that which you feel
to be Evil yourself.

KM mentioned Mrs Iveldon  a Seeress and asked if
it would be wrong for him to go to witness her 
visions in a piece of black coal. (like one of Dr Dees)

9709  There is no harm in your going if you do not
place dependance sufficiently to act upon any
of the instructions that may be given - 
   If you go in the character of an enquirer
and keep yourself seperate and distinct from
her  that is neither calling nor discharging
or requesting appearances - You will do nothing
wrong - 
   To Your first remark I would say that
who ever is so sceptical as not to have faith 
in what is calmly and without any personal
or interested motives  placed by another individual
clearly open before his reason and judgement
he is unworthy of being convinced and must
remain in ignorance

KM.  may I ask have I your permission to show
9710   your responses to such persons.

6
You are at liberty to show them to anyone

KM.   You formerly said that I should attain eminence
by scientific means,  may I now ask for proper advice
as to my future worldly movements as I am now
in much perplexity.

9711  You would do well if you were to give lectures

KM.   Submitted his horoscope.

9712  It seems to me that you will obtain Eminence
through speaking in public
It would be the best thing you could do
lecturing and writing, should you have any
objection , if not at present, at some future time
either to deliver a lecture or to write a work on
Spiritualism

KM.  I know far too little of the subject to give correct
impressions but at a future time I might do so.

9713  If I can aid you with all the information
I possess or can obtain would you do so,
Would it be any help to you.

KM  Yes most certainly

9714  I think it would be best to give a lecture first
Would you do that if the Materials were 
furnished you.

KM  I would most willingly

9715  I will do so as quickly as possible

[We?] were conversing as to [KM?] obtaining his "sight" when there
appeared.

9716  There is a time approaching that would be most
favorable for a lecture on Spiritualism to be 
given, and it must be shown in its true light
not as magic working in the dark.  but as
something natural closely allied to the
inscrutable works of Providence that are
contained in mans own being - that it is
simple as it is beautiful - and will bear
7

any amount of investigation only appearing 
brighter and clearer the more thought and 
the more interest is brought to bear upon it

KM   May I ask if you will mention that time to Mr H 
or to the CA that we may be aware of it

9717    Yes. 
If by that time you could be prepared to 
further the cause, it might do good to yourself 
and others.

KM.   So much has been said respecting the Spirit 
ORION. that it is highly necessary to know as 
much about him as possible may I ask your 
opinion of him. his history & nature.

9718  He is an Evil Spirit in times far gone by 
he was human, and that is the only bright 
spot in the history of his being.
     he is unwilling to tell himself of his origin 
or of his descent in happiness through his 
falling into Sin  the greatest man can commit 
none of us willingly  dwell upon it, and we 
all trust, that he too, and such as he may 
be pure and regenerate - and softer being 
chastened may be made blessed -

KM.  explained as to his mother and her desire to know 
more of Spiritualism   would SOM. kindly learn the 
name of her GS. & would it be right for her to go to 
Mr Croslands.

9719   It would not. do not let her upon any 
account. I will gain the information you 
desire respecting her GS. and will acquaint 
you with it. cannot you take your mirror 
to her.

You told me she would never be able to see

9720    She will not, but when you begin to see 
yourself you would be able to satisfy her, or
8

KM  if you could get a seer to go with it.

Will you learn from who [app]the Spirit was that
appeared at Ms Crossland's and said he was Courage
my GS.

9721  
Yes I will

KM.  May I ask if Swedenborg could now be called to
visible appearance in a Mirror or Crystal or whether he
would only appear in a vague undefined form.

9722
He is shapeless and would appear so
but to Earthly sight?. he has no personality

May I ask why Courage could not see me without my
taking hold of Miss Leigh's hand, altho my Guardian
Spirit while you did not require it altho' not so.

9723
He cannot see you in the Material form any
more Easily than you can see him in the
Spiritual, unless there is some medium by
which you may be made visible, he cannot
see you as you appear to other men, when
you ask if he can see you.

We were discoursing upon the subject when three appeared

9724
It needs very close union with any one for us
to see them.

KM.  You stated - You are the G.S of another may I ask without
offence if that person is aware of the advantage & if
so whether you communicate with him - for referring
to           as to our united existence in Eternity it
might be that this other person would not harmonize with
me and that your guardianship would be void as far
as concerned Eternity in one case or the other, You
have also said that you were drawn towards me -
may I ask your opinion

9725
I am the guardian of another person, that
person altho' unknown to you at present lives
for the working out of a plan. and will be
Your Wife -
[*9*]

KM In one of Swedenborgs works there occurs the 
following passage "If any one (in the SW) think 
of another from affection and earnestly desire to 
see him and speak with him he forthwith 
stands before him." D.P. 50 this seems to coincide 
with the doctrine that form is of less consequence 
than earnestness -

[*9726*] The will is the power that draws you & them 
together, the positive will of the one 
acting upon the negative will of the other.

KM [Wiener?] in his work called "Guardian Spirits" p 48-9 
says "the patient being in a magnetic trance & he 
was asked whether an absolute predestination was 
taught. in the 9th of the Epistle to the Romans, 
hereto she answered very seriously "what GOD has 
not seen fit to reveal to man he should not dive into" 
I think Spiritualism proves directly contrary to 
this assertion.

[*9727*] It does, it is not prohibited by the word 
of GOD, and it is encouraged by all his 
laws. with its restriction of course.

KM Faith and works have thus appeared to me 
Faith as the Occult or secret unseen [relevant?] knowledge 
of the existence of GOD and of SS works refer to the 
actions in this present condition of existence uniting 
spirit & body may I ask your view

[*9728*] Faith has nothing in common with the 
Flesh, it is born in the heart of man from 
his connection with truth, and every one 
who seeks Truth and exerts the power of 
his mind to attain it shall receive into 
his whole being its knowledge, the knowledge 
of its giver and his influence, and the 
offspring shall be faith in the cause

KM on Sept 18. 1856 when a friend of mine Mr [Danion?]
[*10*]

was inspecting the ES Crystal a womans face 
light hair ringlets blue eyes, smiling, long chin 
but rather round face appeared and underneath 
AMI may I ask if Ami is a spirit

[*9729*] It was ADA

KM Would it be advisable to get Mr D. to inspect

[*9730*] Certainly it would if he can see.

KM in the description of the symbols on your seal 
you formerly favored me with you omitted to explain 
the meaning of the crown. and [crescent?] at the top

[*9731*] The crown is the emblem of the highest 
spiritual dignity and the one always 
sought to be obtained - The other the half 
moon is a symbol of our faith that all 
men should be saved even the worshippers 
of idols.

Your last expression is so curious that I venture to ask 
whether those idol worshippers worshipping without 
better knowledge and fervently are not by their 
ignorance sinless in the eyes of GOD.

[*9732*] They are doing good, they are doing every 
thing that their conscience dictates. that 
their innate perception suggests they 
acknowledge a being above their nature 
supreme great enough to rule them. they 
make it to be favorable to their good actions 
and to be angry with their evil doings 
and even if their laws the only ones they 
acknowledge be not of civilization they adhere 
to them and they worship the divinity in 
earnest prayer. they worship a GOD clothed 
with an image after their fashion but 
still endowed with the attribute of a divinity 
they do all every thing that a human 
being unassisted uneducated in the book
[*11*]

[*9732*] of religion can do. and for such as these is the 
Mercy of GOD made manifest - It is for His pleasure 
and at His will that they are in the situation they 
occupy of seeming darkness and ignorance and 
having implanted in them the same properties 
the same likeness of Himself that lives in the body 
of the most enlightened would it not be cruelty 
and injustice to his Creation to punish them 
with one atom, one degree of the torment promised 
to them by their unpitying brethren the unworthy 
members or professors of membership of the 
body of him who intercedes for all.

KM An occult sense has always been attached to the 
recurrence of Halloween. and it was a belief that persons 
born on that day had the faculty of seeing spirits, such is 
the case with myself may I ask whether in the Horoscope 
you are aware of the fact - and has the belief any foundatn.

[*9733*] I know from your figure that you would see, and 
it is the case with all those born on that day. but 
I also knew it when I was first acquainted with 
you from extraneous circumstances

Might I ask you for the names of some good and reliable 
Spirits whom I might call and in whom I might have 
confidence

[*9734*] You can call 
ELEIO a Spirit of the 5th Heaven. 
And you can call 
EVANI he is very willing to appear for 
good purposes. 
And you can call 
AVELA who is an exceedingly good 
spirit and easily appearable.

F.H. As Dr M is here can I call Mohamed Ali to favor 
us with the promised explanation of the Nineveh [?]?

[*973*] There is no objection to your calling him -
9735 He has the option of appearing 12
 I think you would succeed very well were you 
9736 to lecture on any subject with which you were 
familiar
tell [?] thanks and mentioned that I would [?]
deliver the SOM  [?] to D. Mackenzie who in future
would alone invoke in it 
9787 I thank you 
The old man is quite clear.
1/4 to 10 PM.

[Mars symbol] du(?) 23 Feb 1857 
C Antimos
Invoked the C.A.
The C.A. is here as usual 
May I ask if we can be tamed with your promised
work.
I cannot get you the first part of the book 
2696 this evening I can promise it to you next
9738 Tuesday, I intended to do so, believed
that I should have been able but I will give 
it to you next Tuesday.
I [?] to Mr. Thom of Nottingham with your address
to him I have received this strange letter of reply
/The  C.A. looked at it quite surprised/
Shall I read the letter
2697 Yes  9739
Read the letter and requested the CA's opinion
I did not expect such an [?] reply to
your letter and fund from it that I was - ?
My address was intended for himself, to 
strengthen his [?] of opposition to the 
Spirits, by prompting [?] to him a mode of
[*13*]

of operation by which he might keep himself 
separate and distant from them and subdue 
them by a power mightier than any they possess 
and before which they must succumb. - his 
Free will - and also to induce him to rely 
earnestly upon Him who would keep him 
from all harm - and Him solely and witht. 
any mediatorship being used

[*9740*] Instead of this he has so much interwoven 
himself and them hitherto, and so relied upon 
them that his own judgment and will is 
too weak to be impressed except by them, & 
he lays the letter which was only intended 
for himself open to them, and they look to the 
furtherance of their own interest - it is to 
their interest to keep him in subordination 
to them. and so they advised him in his 
reply, and it is only on their assurance 
for the furtherance of their plan that he 
heals you as an imposter and me as nothing.

The man is evidently but a tool in 
their hands his [?] and senseless letter 
is unworthy of an answer. although one of 
bitter truthfulness might be returned.

We cannot help making comparison 
between him openly avowing himself as 
receiving the commands of almighty GOD 
and setting forth in all charity & brotherly 
love - with one who professing no believe 
in an hereafter - no reward for many labors 
and who acknowledges no Christ and yet 
who has devoted a long life and sacrificed 
a princely future for the benefit of his 
fellowmen - only for his love to them and 
his sense of justice - (Robert Owen)
14
I read my note requesting the [action] of my
previous letter and address
I am sorry first, because [our motives?]
were good and quite disinterested on our
part.
[2199]
9741
Expecting [?] your [volumed] book I am [in] prepaid
[??] any questions will you spare me a moment to
fetch a book from the parlor
2700 Certainly
9742 
I read [Mr] Browns book page    I asked his
opinion
2701 [Planetary] spirits such as you have had
9743 [Tescho] was one of them.
I read Mr Browns question & the spirits response as to the rotation of the [crown].
2702 Neither is the investigation of any hidden 
subject prohibited - this searching into
mystery is a proof of intelligence - and
the greater the intelligence the closer the
investigation and the more extended the
knowledge of what appears to the [??]
inpenetrable - the greater the intelligence
the nearer to the [cauly?].
I presume there can be no sin in investigating
the laws of matter - of trying to ascertain the [flame?]
then we witness an effect - whatever there may be 
in trying to [??] spiritual laws.
There is no sin in either - the thought
2703   of [man] is free to penetrate into any
9745   subject that can present itself to this 
mind -
Certainly he must do it in a right mind




[*15*]

I read

[*2704 9746*] It is a question if it was the spirit of Palmer 
from his description it seems but a figure 
used by another influence

It would be a true likeness of him & nearly 
so of his position but were he really present 
he would have been able to have answered 
and would not have needed a scroll 
to be given to him. because those spirits 
who still are earthbound have all the 
faculties of men except the power of 
producing sound, if they wished to 
communicate they appear to speak they 
use the same effort to do so as a many they 
form the ideas and then words.

In reference to ES. I presume he has not now 
the power of appearing in his mortal form.

[*2705 9747*] he has not.

Are there any means of ascertaining if my letters 
are still [exis] at C.

[*2706 9748*] I believe they are not for they were not 
bound and his Son ordered the secretary 
to destroy the loose papers of his fathers 
that were on that subject he taking no 
interest in it - still I cannot say that 
they are destroyed.

I have refrained from calling Capt Barton fearing 
it might not be safe to do so -- could I see him 
this Evening

[*2707 9749*] I do not know whether it would be agreeable 
for him to appear there is always a difficulty 
in communing with any spirits that are 
obliged to pass over water to do so. it is 
repugnant to them
[*16*]

Will you ascertain if he will appear on a future 
evening

[*2708 9750*] I will enquire

I took your advice & consulted Dr Elliottson upon my 
complaint - but I still suffer much from [the] 
wind in the stomach.

[*2709 9751*] I am sorry for it - I have great reliance 
upon the prescription of Dr Elliottson and 
I think that if he fails there is 
scarcely a chance of any other doctor 
succeeding with you.

If it was in my power to tell you of any 
thing that would give you relief I would 
do so most willingly = I am not certain 
of the effects of any medicine and shd 
be afraid to try experiments -

As every mesmerist has a different theory - some 
attributing its effects to a fluid acting by means 
of the passes, others only to the will. may I ask 
your views

[*2710 9752*] Every person is filled with a subtle vapor 
that is continually passing in and out 
of every pore - this vapor from a person 
in good health is healthy & strong and 
from a sickly person the same as they

It can be acted upon and concentrated 
by the will and a person with health 
and strength by directing his will to 
the cure or relief by one deceased [will] emits 
a body of this vapor and receives in return 
a part of the impurities of the one he 
acts upon - the strength of the mesmerizers 
will subdues the weakened one of the 
mesmerized and it becomes in obeyance to 
him and is neutral to be acted upon as
[*17*]

his will may suggest.

do you mean a subtle but material vapor

[*2711 9753*] Yes I do.

Spiritual-Materiality if you may use such 
[a term] an expression - of the same substance 
as those spirits who are beneath man 
that I have before mentioned to you in 
my simile of the peach in the first book I gave you.

Are you acquainted with the nature of the Od. 
force of Reichenbach which appears [to resemble] 
similar to your SM vapor.

[*2712 9754*] I do not quite understand the different 
modes of expression for the same thing 
If it is a power that can be thrown 
off for the purpose of attraction by all 
kinds of life encased in matter by, a 
power of will in man - and instinct in 
animals it is the same.

[By?] [permeates?] [have] by the divining brand have proved that a constant current vapor or force passes thro 
the human [frame] being. similar to the magnetic 
current thro a horseshoe magnet. is the vapor 
you mention analogous to that.

[*2713 9755*] No it is not - It is something in the 
same way that vegetable life throws 
off scent - but electricity is purely spiritual 
it does not arise from the [continuation?] of 
spirit and matter.

Are you aware of the Powers of a [?] Horseshoe magnet 
for attracted Iron and that a constant current 
passes through it

[*2714 9756*] I am

Is it analogous to Electricity - that it is acted upon by 
Electricity is shown by
[*18*]

[*2715 9757*] No t hat is a property possessed by few metals 
of attraction, indeed possessed by all heavy 
and substantial bodies but only observed 
in them

Then mans body must have a great attraction & 
repulsive force continuously in operation

[*2716 9758*] Only Nature throwing off an impregnated 
Gas and receiving back pure air 
In the same way that you have the 
power of breathing upon an object powerfully 
only the one is done by a conscious action 
and the other by an unknown law.

As Mesmerism has made such remarkable cures 
by means the laws of which still remain hidden 
may there not be another as yet unknown quality 
or force in man to effect cures.

[*2717 9759*] The speediness of the cure depends upon 
the strength of the will, and the will is 
strongest when the body is the strongest 
therefore a strong will can send out a 
great store of vapor - there are scarcely 
any limits to the strength of will - it 
may be so strong that the mere laying 
on of hands would cure a disease, this 
would be the most speedy means of cure 
that man could use - he has no other 
curative power inherent in his nature 
but - mesmerism producing this it does 
many good effects & is attended with 
very man evils.

by what means can I strengthen my Will

[*2718 9760*] No answer.

May I request an answer to that question

[*2719 9761*] It does you harm to mesmerise people
[*19*]

Yet I always feel relieved & more comfortable after Mesm.

[*2720 9762*] It exhausts the system

but you have evaded my question

[*2721 9763*] only because you should not practise it 
Your will is quite strong enough for mesmerizing

May we receive a Spiritual Vision

[*2723 9760*] I am sorry that it has happened, and I think 
it would be best to let it drop, being so 
rapt up, as he is in his Spirits and so 
ardent for their cause, it is likely that he 
would follow their advice were they to desire 
the publication of it - if no notice is taken 
of his reply the subject will drop. - his 
letters only show that he is extremely ill bred

I do not know whether you would wish

know.

There are many magical [?] I do not tell any 
of my friends

[*9838*] Well if you have a little time to spare I 
will relate it - I wanted your advice on 
[?]die thats what I came for - but to begin 
at the beginning
23
Last ♂︎die fortnight I received a letter from my
mother in Spain , that day I had been on duty
at the Horse Guards and I did not leave until
near upon 4 oClock and I was crossing the
park thinking intently on the contents of a
letter I had in my pocket.— The thoughts of
it were well calculated to make me very sad
and brought to my mind a vivid recollection 
of her past conduct and her and my present
Position—

9839
    The letter spoke of Politics and the
present affairs of Spain and regretted that
I could not be induced to leave my situation
and England and take any station in
Spain.— I was sorry that I could not so
and more sorry that it was her actions that
prevented me, and how deeply I desired to be
there what I might have been [[?]] with
Honor and honesty had she not banished
me by her interference in state affairs—her
intrigues and her many crimes—I thought
much of the past, of the people murdered
for it was nothing Else — butchered in the
sheets of Madrid some free months since
of the many families made destitute
and desolate — the many impoverished &
ruined , of the money that had been
squandered at her instigation and I
then thought of a remark made by the
spirit of my Mirror— on an Evening or
two before ( in the ♂︎die before) —
    Speaking of religion he had said
"That the souls of those who left the world
after committing much sin endured as
their punishment every torment they had
24

9839
"inflicted directly, or indirectly thro' the agency
"of others., that the sins of their victims
"were cast upon their own heads ["] and
"that the sufferings they had caused had
"to be endured by themselves"— 
    I thought if such a fate awaited
man in afterlife of the frightful punishment
that must be awarded her, and I trusted
most heartily that she might die repentant
or live to see the [?] of the vanity and
Ambition for which alone she now lives.
and although her death is the only event
that could recall me to Spain , that could
make me what I ought to be, and release
me from my embarrassments, that now impede
my progress, and is likely to always keep
me without any rank or distinction in
England. and I have often been tempted
to wish that she were removed, for I am sure
it would be better for Every one.—
    At that moment regardless of Personal
benefit I only desired most heartily that
she might live — well I went home full
of the same thoughts, I had temporary
Lodgings in Picadilly which I was going
to leave for a Visit in the Country and the next
Evening ♄die thinking still of this subject
I went into my room and then I rememb'd
that I had a book in my possession that
I had not looked at since I had been
in England this time -   It was locked
up with some more in a Small Cabinet
in my book case of which I was very
Careful, and had not opened — indeed
it had been locked up for a good many
25

9839   months — I am particularly careful to
keep my old Mss locked up, and where
they cannot be looked at by a Visitor or any
one opening the book case — this old Ms
was given me  or rather it was not given
me for I took it — from a Priest when I
was a catholic and a believer in the efficacy
of their intercession or Excommunication —
This old man was a member of some
part of our family, and was attached to
the Count and he had in all the palaces
a little room appropriated to him — he was
very hard living and very eccentric and
in this little room he had only his truckle
bed  a few books  a chair  a Crucifix a bason
of holy water and two or 3 pictures — one day
he was taken ill —he could not bear the
idea of dieing but he had a great dread of
having a doctor , he never came out of his
room all that day, I remember it as
though it were Yesterday — & he would never
allow any one to go in , there were several
messages sent to enquire why he did not
present himself — "he wasn't well" - could
not get up"— would he undo his door? -
No he would not undo his door— would
he have a doctor?   No - he didn't want to
be poisoned — would he have any food ?
No - he had got plenty — these answers were
sent back several time, last of all I went, I stood
outside begging and entreating to be let
in for half an hour — I should not have
stood so long  but I wanted to see what
he had got inside— its as not any love
for him — so as it was getting dark &
26

9840
he was getting worse and he wanted a light 
and could not find it, he after many precautions 
let me into the room. I saw after 
getting a light a very good alteration in 
his appearance — he was an old man but 
had been a very robust and healthy one 
his eyes were sunk, his face pale and 
haggard he looked terrified, he had some 
herbs of some sort, there and I was afraid 
he had been taking wrong ones but he assd. 
me had not.-- he said he should be better 
by the morning, and wished me to set up 
with him —he would not have a domestic 
upon my account — not he — they would 
rob him — so I promised after lighting his 
little lamp that  I would return if he wld 
allow me to go and fetch something to lay 
upon, I went out but I was to inform 
my mother of the change that had taken 
place and to get them to have in readiness a
physician and proper people watching
ready to come in if I thought it was necessary.
For I did not wish the old man to die
without any one being near and after that I
returned to him_ and after being some time
with him we became very sociable, let me
look at some of his books, that I had taken
down and told me what they were. I told him
of my love of magical works and he told me
to fetch and old and curious MS._ I told
him I could see visions and related to him
some of my experience at which he was much 
pleased and said he would explain to
me this old rarity, it was a MS dated as
Emily as 1543 and its contents had
27
been he assured me the means by which the
priesthood had stopped the progress towards
happiness of spirits after death, that it
was given at the date mentioned by a spirit
to one of the order to which he belonged and
and that it was a certain means of keeping souls
in purgatory, and then he turned it over &
found the precious seal that was to do this
his voice was getting weaker, and I thought
he was near his end.  I looked at the Talisman
for some time and wondered whether it really
did effect such a frightful  purpose - [and was]
given by spirits it might call in the [aid?]
of thou who were powerful enough to control
the disembodied spirits of persons leaving the
9841
earth sinfully - and I doubted not of
its efficacy then - but seeing such a change
rapidly come over the monk, I earnestly
begged of him, if he would not have allowed [?]
to have another priest to administer extreme
unction - at last after much persuasion
when he found himself dying he allowed
me to fetch him one who was [??]
but before doing so I said to him if any thing
does happen to you may I have that book
he laid hold of it all the tighter but did not
answer me - he did not say I should not tho,
and when I returned with the Priest, he had
scarcely the time to give him the benefit
of his [scences?] before the old man ceased
to breathe. I was extremely anxious about
it and whilst they were weeping & wailing
a whole room full, I walked off with
the book and kept very close to my own
apartments until I had thoroughly
















[*28*]

Perused it, and stowed it away safely 
in my little cabinet -

[*9841*] It has always travelled with me 
since but I think from that time up to 
last [?]die fortnight I had not looked at 
it more than 2 or 3 times and not once 
lately - but on that Evening the thoughts 
that I have mentioned, and my having 
the benefit of different opinions given me by 
better Spirits, making me dislike my 
old modes of Communion, and magic works 
I felt included to destroy this one. and I 
felt so dull and low spirited, that I was 
inclined to believe that the possession of a 
book with the names of such powerful 
Evil spirits in them was calculated to make 
one worse and perhaps bring them about 
me. -

I could not help thinking of every 
thing that was horrible, that might this 
book and my mother were never [out of 
my thoughts] once unconnected in my brain 
and I thought I might as well do it at 
once if I did intend destroying it at all 
for it would not be so well to continue so 
unsettled about it, and for the first time in 
my life I did not like to leave it behind 
me when I went into the Country. on Saturday 
although it was locked up and I had the 
key - I always lock the door and leave 
the key with my man until I return so 
that having the key of the door he might 
enter before my return, I dont believe him 
to be very curious, but I felt unsafe about 
it, other keys might fit the cabinet besides
[*29*]

[*9841*] mine, and the book took an importance 
and a magnitude in my mind that it 
had never done before, it worried me 
almost unbearably - so I determined to burn 
it - I unlocked the cabinet and took the 
few old books out of it and laid them 
this one amongst them on the table, It 
was laying in the middle of those I took 
out, and immediately after I had removed 
the one that was at to [P.?] of it away. the 
book clearly and perceptibly moved as 
though when it found itself relieved of its 
pressure it tried to open. - and slowly and 
gently the cover rose a little and then fell 
then the cover moved up with a few leaves 
attached to it and fell back again flat 
then it moved up again with about a quarter 
of the book and again shut close and the 
3rd time it moved up slowly and fell open 
flat upon the Table. as though it has 
overbalanced itself, I was so astonished 
that I could not have touched it, had my 
life depended upon it then leaf after leaf 
flew gently over on to the Cover that had 
opened itself until it came to that part 
where this wonderful seal was, this part 
swelled out before opening as though 
some large substance was between the two 
leaves and they were closed at the edge 
to keep it upright. I saw the substance 
one end that I saw was green, and the 
other end was red presently these two leaves 
divided themselves and laid open each 
onto the part that was lying flat on either 
side on the Table - and on the seal
[*30*]

[*9841*] the whole length of the book their laid a hand 
large and fleshy looking as mine and apparly 
as sold, the fingers as far as the knuckles 
were of a deep crimson from that part to the 
middle of the hand was white as white [?] 
skin and from the middle of the hand to the 
termination of the wrist where it seemed cut off 
was a bright green - the part where it should have 
been attached to the arm of an individual 
had sticking [of] out from it something like the 
a knife handle or at least part with a blade 
and a knob at the end of it, and the blade 
inserted into the hand - round this nob 
at the end of the blade was the names that 
are invoked on the sale, and I presume 
had I taken hold of the handle of the knife 
or put my hand upon it, would have been 
a sufficient invocation to secure the presence 
of the spirits there around where the hand laid

I was not afraid - I have been used to 
Spiritual interviews but I wondered why 
the hand should appear so solid & fleshy 
I kept far enough off - as far as I could away 
from the handle that had the name on 
but passed my finger over the book so that 
I might touch the hand and see if it 
really were what it looked to be I approachd. 
it only with one finger, but I passed it right 
across the page as though nothing had 
been laying there I seemed to cut the hand 
in two in the same way as you cut the 
flame of a candle - so that it was there 
only to the sight evidently and not to 
the touch. -

After I found that it was nothing
[?] I tried to close the book again 
upon it for I assure you I did not desire 
to have any thing more to do with what I 
knew to be [?]  - with a strong 
exorcism I did close it, and after I had closed it 
without my assistance without feeling any 
pressure under my hand I repeated the 
exorcism and then I tried to destroy the 
books, but I could not do it, after many 
many trials which lasted for nearly an 
hour, I succeeded in cutting off one of the 
covers! but tear the paper or cut it I could 
not. I could not cut one leaf of it, so
I tied a piece of string round it tight and 
tied it up in paper, and put it back in 
the cabinet, and I don't know what to do 
with it - Its there now I asked the spirits 
in the Mirror and they told me they did 
not know. - That it would not hurt me 
so long as I did not invoke the spirits 
there named.
The Seal is by Triangles making 
6 points ✡ and in the center a circle painted
green and inside the circle some lines 
running parallel with a loop at the opposite 
end of each, and constructed so as with 
as with two lines slantingly across them 
they formed a gate each line making a bar 
on the 3 middle lines are 3 names and 
at the bottom of the bars is a round blank 
hole as though the gate home placed over

Will you allow me to ask you a Question before leaving

9849   Yes

I related Mr Andersons adventure with the M Ss. &
requested his opinion

9850   I know the Talisman I think the best thing
he could do would be to draw a pen full
of Ink through the Names and obliterate
them.  And so make the Talisman
ineffectual and then he could destroy it or
keeping it, it would be of no harm

Now he's going

My seer being too unwell this Evening for me to Invoke the

advice P. the Spanish Monk gave me as to your M.S.

9853   Well what did he say

I read the response (p 33)

9853   do you think it [would?] answer
I can get it out and try it
I am most anxious to destroy it and I think
it would be the best way.  Only I am afraid
of taking it out.  -
I think I will stay until you have the 
opportunity of asking the C A.

I will do so perphaps on♀︎die - certainly on♂︎die & let
you know immediately

9854   I thank you  I think I will wait , I cannot

Seven o mina is here dressed as before.
May I ask if we can see Mohamed Ali this Evening
that we may receive his explanation of the Nineveh
Inscriptions - & if not can we see the Metered Angel

9770   I cannot promise his appearance for I
know nothing of him.

Can we see the Metered Angel

9771   I know that he is willing to appear any
Sunday when called.

What is the eating of the term "Metered"

9772   the Crown is metered that is definitely
shaped

Dr Mackenzie will now with your permission
Propose his own questions,
KM, then explained as to Sevenomina's advice as to his
Lecturing. & requested again his views

9773   It seems very desirable that Spiritualism
should be placed before Men in its true light
and made simple and easily to be understood
by them,  and yet showing the importance
it has in connexion with themselves.
     You could review the progress of the
Rapping Spirits and place them in Contrast
with those who have appeared thru different
mediums — and you could speak of the
Communication of the one being more Consistent
with religious feelings,  the scriptures &
with mans feelings — and as leading him
to a better and a surer End than the
Rapping Spirits by whom he is too often
alluded Even to insanity
36
And of mans being Able to appreciate
more highly and place more dependance
upon what makes itself manifest to his
reason  and calls into exercise the faculties
of his intellect than that which only approaches
him through the grossest material
KM but Mr. Crosland for instance would deny this and
offer proofs that the Rapp. [Is] were good and had
given him reliable information — may I ask your
view.

9774   The Success of the undertaking depends
upon the strength of the Effort — If you
make your case appear plainer than
his you gain at the end—
      But if you did not lecture upon
Spiritualism  I think you would succeed
as a lecturer upon any subject you feel
Yourself most capable of mastering.

KM. you promised to aid me with all the information
in your power— may I ask if you will do so

9775   Yes  I am quite willing to give you my
Assistance

KM. would it be advisable for me to address Mr B
of Nottingham and try to set him right

9776   The C. A very Soon made it known of his
treatment of Mr Hockley's Effort to set
him right — there can be no objection to
 a Second trial on your part for it is a good
Effort and even were it not to succeed
while it rouses his indignation in shaking
his faith  even slightly in the mightiness
of those with whom he Converses , it would
be a great thing — his doubt of them might
increase through objections being raised
by different persons , and at last he might
37
might divest himself of their influence[s] and
then I believe were he once. convinced of it
no man would be a stricter follower of
the right mode fo operation.

KM I will then do so shall I give him your
name or not.

9777   Yes you may

KM To what sphere shall I state that you belong

9778  The Sixth
And particularly mention that I am
Your Guardian Spirit, and that my interest 
and that our interest as a body is closely
connected with. Mans ,  and that what
we urge as opinions firmly maintained by
us can be in any way to lead him
astray because his after life is ours &
ours his — that we are too much interested
in his future life -- ever to advocate anything
that is uncertain or unstable.

KM. I think it would be unadvisable to maintain
my acquaintance with Mr H.

9779   Certainly  it would

FH.  do you mean Dr M. is to mention my name

9780   To be written unconnected with you in
any way for he would probably be of
opinion that it was another of your Efforts
written by a second person at your
instigation

KM.  Have you any objection to his calling you
for instance   have I your permission o say he may
do so.

9781  Do not Solicit him to call me. make it
optimal for him to call me - If he does
so I have no objection to appear but I do
not wish it pressed upon him — because
38
Although it is not in our nature to be
uncourteous or offensive, it is extremely
unpleasant to have things said to us
personally that are uncongenial to our
feelings. — we do not like to be abused.

KM.  I thank you may I ask when I may expect
an installment of the work of astrology.

9782   When you can devote an Evening to it in
Your mirror.

I explained that I would take an opportunity to fix
an Evening.
KM.   Am I to continue to wear the Talisman You formerly
gave me or only your seal.

9783   Keep them both about you.

KM.   do you know or can you learn when Men first
used the Crystal & the Origin of the practise

9784   The Urim and Thurim in the breastplate 
of Aaron was a Crystal, and it was then
used for the purpose of divining — It has
been used for the purpose in all Ages
And I believe more in uncivilized than
in Civilized Countries

KM    as to Miss Andrews

No answer.

KM   May I ask how it is that you have never been
a Guardian Spirit before although you have existed
so many thousands of Years.

9785   You seem to suppose that I have been in
existence since the beginning of time   it
does not necessary follow that because
I have never been embodied, that I must
have existed from Unlimited Space
     Spirit is the Offspring of Spirit. I
am not one of the Heavenly host and
I was not called into existence wilst
39

there was a vacant place for me to fill
and when it was necessary for me to do
the duties of one who had gone his way
I had being and in the course of events
my share -- I have taken upon myself
an office of responsibility -- Equal to my power
a right fulfillment must be my unceasing 
prayer. -- constant aim and never ceasing 
work.

You kindly promised to obtain me the name of my
Mothers GS. have you done so

9786
I have done so and it is
GES-SEOVA

Will you give me his order Station & Sphere & may
I call him at some future time.

9787
It is not advisable for you to call him yet
he is a peculiar Spirit, extremely peculiar
He is a good spirit and of a high order
of extensive Knowledge deep penetrative
and earnest enquiry, but he's peculiarly
obtuse

If my &c

9788
I have not

CA Mirror
Invoked Mohammed Ali
No vision

No vision

I requested the CA inform me if [MA?]
[is?] would not appear -- when Emma said
heres some one coming & also some reading
40

9789   "You have called for Mohammed Ali.
but he is Evidently "not at home" to you
this Evening — I have the C A's permission
to appear. "I hope I dont intrude" I want
to say a word for you particularly—

Mr Anderson then appeared in blue frock coat
his dress Uniform   red stripe    down the trousers  no
Epaulettes. & said

9790   I as not aware of his presence &
And then turned round & was leaving when I
requested him tor return. which he did & said

9791   I am very sorry I appeared  it was
only a little matter I had to mention
to you.

We are very glad to see You. & Dr M. has much
wished to be present when You might appear

9792   I thought as you was using the mirror
& M A would not appear. [ I would come
in I did not know you were engaged]
It is so seldom now I havE an opp'y.
to squeeze myself in.

Have you seen or Communicated with Mr Brown
of Nott'm.—

9793   Yes I have he is an old [?]
I have read his pamphlets & goodness
knows they are not calculated to raise
spiritualism in the Estimation of any one
but rather to make it ridiculous  I cannot
think how you came to write to him.

I knew him to be in Enor , I believe him still
to be a sincere, man — I thought he might be
a Great human I havE found him to be simply
a Lunatic — Spiritualism has upset the
Equilibrium of his Brain — & consequently
41

the planet any Spirits he invokes can lead 
him by the nose to say or do any thing --

9794
I should have thought you would have
seen after reading his works that it 
would be useless writing to him, for he
evidently believes himself "the highest
authority" on all Spiritual matters.

I explained that I had only read his book of 
knowledge & pages & of his
Have you had any Curious Spiritual information
lately.

9795
I have had nothing very particular in
my Mirror

What was the other affair you were going to mention

9796
No answer

Your adventure with the Spirit in the bottle 
or rather out of it. has interested all my friends
very much and I often think about it.

9797
I have had the misfortune to have another
adventure.--
You will blame me for it. --
I do not think at least, I do not know
whether it would be right for any one
just beginning the study of Spiritualism 
as Mr Mackenzie is. -- without being able 
to control it so well as those who have 
have had greater experience to be made
acquainted with transactions of any one
with Evil Spirits

I explained as to Dr M.

9798
I have done mischief enough inadvertently
before and I will take this precaution
now --
I will tell you the circumstance
42 
when next I appear any when it will 
be convenient for you to receive me and 
then if you think proper you can give 
Mr M a copy—
You are yourself not aware of the nature 
of it—
I thank you I will then call you in Tuesday Ev 
9799 
I am aware that I must appear rude 
to Mr Mackenzie 
KM. I beg to say, I do not think so at all 
I must apologize for it—I should have 
retired but you must bear the blame. 
9800 
It is not my willingness that he should 
know it, I would not willingly have 
done so myself. 
I explained 
9801 
Very well 
What do you think about Lord Palmerston & his 
appear to the Country 
9802 
I do not think he has much chance 
I prefer him to z Lscarle 
9803 
Are you for the Admission of Jews  into 
Parliament at all 
Oh yes. Men of no religion set there, why not 
a conscientious Jew—what is Camell or Lewis & religion 
9804 
I was not at the Club last Evening as I 
went out of town at 5 oh clock, must return 
again tomorrow morning though. 
have you been to Cheltenham lately on “urgent furrah
business” 
9805 
little recreation—little recreation Sir. 
pray how is Miss Gerginson—I hope quite well 
9806 
Not heard from her for some time—
You know that little Crystal with the 
Gold Chain I had—it’s Smashed—
43

I am sorry for it though it was not much use to me
it was too small to see visions or reading
plainly -- and since I have got the 
Mirror I have been able to get on better 
without it --

Have you ever appeared in Mr M's Mirror

9807
I have not had any communication with
him through it but I tried to appear
because he appeared to me 

do you hear him speak

9808
Yes, and see him there writing
You know that [Evani?] Glass you made
the instructions for which I [?] so

Yes

9809
I have had some Visions in that lately
at least in the one I made like it

I have not used any Evani Glass this last 2 years
not since Mr D annoyed me so much by appearing
[& annoy] & acting [?]

9810
or I did

exactly so

I must now wish you good Evening as Mr M. has to
catch the Train

9811
What dont you give your friends a bed
when they come to the country.
A country house & no room for strangers

[RM?] when I appear in you Crystal I hope I do not
annoy you

9812
O no certainly not

[RM?] when I have any sight I hope I shall see you

9813
I am quite willing to appear but I am
afraid I should prove a very -----
affair

Now he laughs

RM what did I say when I appeared to you
44

9814   You told me you been going to Croydon
[*KM*]  When did I appear

9815   the Friday you appeared last.

Friday fortnight

9816   not so recently as that I think

Was it in January

9817   It must have been in Jan'y.  I really
do not remember the date  it was a
short time before I appeared to Mr. Hockley
last

Mr H. said he w'd call him on Tuesday to hear his
relation

9818  Very good  I must thank you then and
apologize for appearing - and wish you
good night

1/4 Past 8.      C A Mirror
The C A is here as usual
In Consequence of my Seer's being so unwell we have not
Invoked lately , may I ask if we can be favored with the
Continuation of your MS.

2730   9855   I would willingly give it , but your seer could not
read it

I explained Mr Andersons difficulty as to the Spanish MS
containing the Talisman  he wished to destroy & requested
the C A's advice.            (  page      ).

2731   9856   He must put something on the leaf which
contains the Talisman that will deface it
or else burn a hole in the paper and then it
would be powerless  & he might destroy it other ways.

Since I saw you Mr Gelkes has favored me with a letter
on the Contents of your Metaphysical work. — and upon
such a subject - I need not say how much it interests
me I will at another sitting place it before you

2732   9857   I know that you have received a letter and
I wish you to read it   I know some of it
but not all.

do you mean it to be read this Evening

2733   9858   Yes

I read Mr. Gelkes letter of the

2734   9859   Had Mr Gelkes opinions been given unasked
I should have answered them to him personally
but as the volume was given to him for
criticism I can only make a passing
remark.
     That it was not written to meet the
view of any religious party or sect, and
that if it destroys the Christians hope and
dependence and ungrounds the self satisfied
46

2734   9859   Assurance of Salvation to individuals, it
Establishes hope and faith and reliance
in GOD's mercy., and love and Charity in the
hearts and minds of all men without
distinction who would receive it in its true
sense and act upon the principles that it
inculcates , and I maintain that it does
not make one the less a Christian because
I am not of the party who violate the
laws of Justice of purity and of innocense
and betray the All merciful into the murder
of His son.
     No one can uphold the doctrines
of true Christianity more firmly than I.
None be more earnestly convinced of their
Efficacy in procuring for man a future
home in Eternity in the presence of HIs
maker., none advocate more strenuously the
doctrines which Christ promulgated on the
Earth. — None pay greater homage or
more heartfelt adoration for his example
or his words. — but at the same time I deny 
because I know it to be false , I know it
to be contradicted by reason , by the whole
tenor of his life   by every example shown
us by every thing taught by the Almighty
in his unspeaking Creation that a sacrifice
Considered as it is by men. was never
necessary , and that it never took place
and that a belief in the sacrifice of Flesh
and blood is not consistent with the religion
taught by Christ and is not acceptable
nay — that it turned men away from the
face of GOD.
47

2734 
9859  That Christ made a Sacrifice for the [good]
sake of Man, I allow, he came out of a
state of perfect happiness, the higest state
that can exist parted from the father and
Heaven.  and came into the world of sin
that he took upon himself the flesh with
all its cares and sorrows and wants and
ills.   and made himself a partaker of
life's poorest share for the sake of giving
unto his brethren by the only Effectual
means.  such a lesson and example that
should make them partakers of His
everlasting life in glory. -- This was a
sacrifice of his own happiness for theirs
and a pleasing one, and with this earthly
life he had every feeling of the flesh.
and having such he did not scruple to
end his life as he had begun it- and
he died as he had lived, showing that the
most violent death and the most brutal
treatment could not alter his love and
goodwill towards those who persecuted
him — so he sacrificed even his comfort as
a man.  for the sake of further illustrating
his teaching  and when he makes mention
in these words of his dying a ransom and
a sacrifice he means only such as I have
mentioned - Not one of his words can
justify man in believing that a sacrifice
of flesh and blood, such as may be offered
with success.  to spirits of evil power - when
man is seeking his advancement in the 
hidden mysteries of a forbidden subject
— that such a sacrifice is acceptable to
Him who lives only in the purest of Spirit
48

2734   9869   And unto whom nothing but the purest
of Spirit can approach.
     Mr Gilke mention the part in wch
I have spoken of the graduated scale of
being the highest of which is GOD. and
the lowest the power of Evil. and of man
being the Centre. — and he has misunderstood
me.   He confounds spirit with life —
Life is Spirit — but all spirit is not life —
The Universal spirit that I havE mentioned
is life , the [animatory?] power of weak spirit
and that exists more or less in Every thing
Created — Yes Even in a knub of Coal —
an atom of wood — a little stone — and
it is by that each particle adheres to the
other and they keep their separate
condition and properties & hold together and
be what they are. — but I do not make
them part of that graduated scale of beings
which I might have better perhaps
called intelligences of which man is the
Centre because in him the opponents meet
in him Material has its perfection — in him
is the power of decision.

   One More, And I have done
        The Assertion of Mr Gilkes that my
intentions are other than I seem that
I am leading you away from the path
of Christ and of Salvation, is presumption —
because it is unfounded.
     It was I who first made my impression
upon you in having faith in his mediations
and his good offices — It was I who
49
2734
who presented to you views, that being more
Consistent with Charity and less united
with bigotry and selfishness, seem to you
reasonable and right—I have always
strivEd—Contrary to his opinion—to Establish
Your faith on such a fair looking as should
lead you to and not from the Saviour of
Man and have brought the necessity of a
reliance on his mediation and advocacy
as the sure and certain means of preserving
the immortal soul — and if I have renounced
the spurious part of the bible , and paid
no heed to those parts which I know to be
uninspired, it is because they contradict
that which is inspired and taht which is
alone the Truth. — The works of Jesus Christ
and them only form the necessary and
the important part of the bible , these I
have not violated but have [?] them
to you with the most earnest desire in
all occasions of further Cementing Your
Union with the doctrines of Christ.
— How much I have succeeded You
not I can tell him.— And another [?]
in which he Errs, is that if speaking of
the loss of man's own will in the greater
will of the Almighty — is impossible as
it is objectionable — impossible Universally
and objectionable individually— Pleasing
to those who are under and solely guided
the Holy Spirit but unjust to the many
who seek righteousness, and yet are informed
— because when Man's free will is gone
he is not a responsible gent he is not
the Center of a Spiritual line and is made
50
2734
a good or an Evil one as the influence
leaving upon him and stinting his own
will may be. — were all men recepients
of such divine favor as to make them
impeachable to Evil what need of a heaven
what need of a hereafter, what need of a
soul. the present would be perfect and
the Earth would be paradise—
9859
He has misunderstood me entirely
but his sect forbids him to do otherwise
the proud and lofting idea of his being
man enough to throw off the [?] of
imposed doctrines and creeds is more
perhaps than he can bear, for then with
his free will unfettered his reason imbrained
and his decision alone taken from the
apparent truthfulness of whatever is placed
before him, he would not perhaps be
under the happy impression that he aws
the special recipient of that divine favor
which should givE him such perfect
happiness by making the highest principles of his nature a nullity and
a void —
May I ask your Views as to his Remarks Relating to
the Holy Spirit
2735
I overlooked it
9860
That is Contradicted on the work
itself , for my closing wins is that into
the hearts of his believers the Almighty
may send down his holy influence
like the Moons Rays falling upon the
bosom of a lake.— I recognize the
Holy Spirit and firmly believe in the
[5?]
2735
healing and Comforting of heart which its
presence must bring into man, I believe
it to be the Countenance of GOD. Shining
down upon those who receivE His image
into their hearts. by earnest desire to live
a life that is pleasing in his sight to do
?
by their Actions that which they think
Acceptable to him , to worship him with
their whole beings and to trust in him
for goodness & mercy. _ His [In?fluence]
His holy Spirit comes down to assure them
that their trust is not in vain that their
prayers are heart , and that their faith c strength
and reliance is the Evidence of his presence.
9860
I see in Him the universal influence
of good the All pervading and closely watching
eye of divine providence protecting the good
Strengthening the weak. lifting up those
that fall and healing the sick at heart.
And I believe that it is the consequence
of the Son of Mans Example—had he never
come upon the earth and taken upon
himself flesh. — this all pervading influence
would not have been as manifest as it is
now — but I do not look upon the Holy
Ghost as king in one man Entirely and
in another not at all some belive themselves
to be acting under its inspiration at times
and that the words coming from their
lips are such as that Holy Spirit utters from
them internally — I say again were it to
do this — Man is no longer the free and responsible AgEnt that he is intended to
be by GOD.

Called M Anderson

Mr A appd immediately and I read the CA's advice as to
destroying the Talisman in the Spanish MSS.

9861
I will do it then I have not done it yet, I
feel very uncomfortable about it ever since it
occurred and if I can destroy it I shall be
much pleased 
I am much obliged to you for making the 
enquiry

I doubt my MS copy of the CA’s Spiritualism Philosophy 
which he has retrieved & I have just read his remarks 
to the CA. 
9862 
Rather opposed I suppose. 
Yes on detemal points—but as my Seer is not well I will 
relate it to you another Evening 
9863 
I will appear again when his consonent 
Good night 
☉die April 5th 5:57 UM. 20 to 4 PM 
requested P del to show the book which came wimby 
I speared at the proper place my Seer copied it for an 
houd. 
♂ 7th April 1857 CA Mirror 
Invoked the CA 
8:20 PM. 
The CA is here with the book in his hand 
I mentioned my Seer being still unwell I would 
with his permission defer use the book until next 
Tuesday.—
My friend Lea him just had a New Mirror with Care 
& folding down made of solid walnut. Wood. ascending 
to the instructions given by Ellismon and Milk 
53
Your Sanction I should like to havE a Similar one
made for your appearance — if you will accept the Charge
2736
9864
I do not think another is necessary
but if you desire it I will do so
If you do havE one it will be best to havE it
lined with purple rather than with red
do you mean the same color as your robes.
5
2737
Yes
do you prefer any particular wood
2738
9866
It is of no consequence, but I think a dark
wood is preferable to a light one.
will dark Mahogany be agreeable.
2739
9867
It is quite immaterial and According to fancy
the Color is the only thing that I should
wish to be particular about.
Will objects appear longer in proportion to the Mirror
2740
98607
News of places and Scenes would.
but a single figure would be the same because
this allows it to appear a true size, larger
than that it could not be
Ellesmo has expressed a wish taht Miss Leigh should
go to Lime house tomorrow EvEning as he wishes her
to be the first to inspect the New Mirror — and She
has kindly Consented to do so if you havE no objection
2741
9869
I havE not
Ellesmo is in every respect what he Represents
himself to be and whilst he remains the
guardian Spirit of Mr lea I havE no doubt
or anxiety about the influences that might
otherwise and have surrounded him
And whatever Ellesmo's purpose may be
I am certain that it is one that he
Earnestly believes to be for the good of
his Charge — He feels and that rightly
that you have more power of Will than
54

Mr Lea and also possessing a Seer with greater
advantages.  can help him in his task.
And if you feel that you can conveniently do
that which he desires I am pleased that it
should be done.

As my Seer is too unwell this Evening to read your
work I hope to receive it on Tuesday next.

2742  9870    I will do my best to make the book plain
but I cannot urge it upon you this Evening
because being a long time at it, [this Evening]
tomorrow Evening you might not see so well

If any &c

2743    I have nothing tonight

The C A left.  10' to 9 PM.

5' to 9 PM.  Oval Mirror
               Called Mr Anderson
he is here in black  a very long black frock Coat.
Good Ev'g Mr A.

9871    Good Evening

May I ask how you go on with your Spanish MS.

9872    I go it out on Wednesday Evening, put it
on the Table and it began to show a
sign of motion  the leaves [?] up and
down.  but I as quickly as possible forced
it open at the place where the Seal is
and I had ready a sponge with some
oxalic acid in and that quickly took 
the Color out, but not quite removed the
old ink or whatever the black part
is done with for it seems to be iron moulded
into the paper -- but however I think it 
is done sufficiently  -- I did not destroy
it, I have not done so yet.

55

You sh'd have used Muriatic Acid because a little Spirits of
Hartshorn w'd in a great measure Restore the Color of the Ink

9873     I could tear that leaf out without burning
the whole book. now.

Then why not do so at once, the Secret is a most
Repulsive one.

9874     I will now you have suggested it might
be made to reappear, I thought I had
obliterated it. I will cut it out & burn it
I might destroy the whole book for any
value I attach to it now but these old
things have a charm that I cannot get
over

It is so with me and altho' If the CA desired it, I
would destroy all my old magical MS. & some are
very rare & Curious — Yet I sh'd treasure them up &
Even now am adding to the number.

9875    It is a natural love of the marvellous I
suppose , but there is a feeling I cannot
get over of absorbing interest in black
magic that nothing else possesses, and 
yet if I thought or was told that harm
might come from Keeping it   I would
summon up Resolution enough to destroy
it.

If we possessed the power of stirring these Spiritual
marvels as the Palingensian of plants & Animals do
by the aid of Good Spirits we should not Covet
Evil.

9876     I think that the highest Spiritual
intercourse is only intended to apply to
the higher faculties of Man and consequently
it cannot be so closely allied to his senses
or his corporeal faculties and so cannot
be made manifest enough to excite & interest
him.
56 
MªMackenzie has written to Mr Mown of Notten 
As to his Spiritual teachings received a reply 
Which altho in his usual dogmatic Speteutions 
Style is not so Vulgar as his letter to me. 
9877 
Aid MM write on the same subject 
As you then 
Yes 
9878 
Then why did the old fellow treat you as 
an impostor and [you] his as genuine 
I never would trouble myself to write to 
such a man he is not even a gentleman 
DM did not so entirely oppose his view as I did 
in more. 
9879 
Poor old man his heads turned I should 
thank from what I have read of his Eabbish 
Replied 
9880 
I think so too I read his account of his interview with 10th Palmer. 
What do you think of that 
Dont think it was him that really appeared 
at all, I think it was what they call a 
dummy—You know they are always 
Animated—Atmospheric Spirits I mean 
9881 
I think his Spirits play him hicks 
and that they have by them as many 
dummies as those Gentlemen at the fair 
with their Punch and Lady Shows fruit 
putting up one & speaking for it and 
then another., and save and except the 
dog Soby I think it is as amazing 
and ginte as Unimportant, but I 
think really that none of the communications 
he has received even from his “highest pouces” have any weight at all when 
they warn upon Subjects of Vital importance

Yes.— he does not get on very well it seems as Yet
he has not yet developed his own Sight, which has been
promised.
9883
I hope he will he is very inquisitive to know who
I am, I learn he has been enquiring at the
Booksellers — I want to find out when he is
about somewhere that I may Get a look at him
You can meet him at the Antiquarian Society he lectured
there a few months since
9884
will you let me know when he givEs another
Yes he has promised to take me & you can then get
a squint at us both.
9885
I feel myself too much flattered, I should
like to go through very well I dont know
much about the Antiquarian Society — or
how to get admittance is it by tickets
An appreciation to the Secretary wd do doubtless
9886
I am not acquainted with my member.
When you appear in Mr Ms. Mirror ask him for a Card
& he will send you one
9887
Perhaps he would like to bring it personally
And take me under his Arm.
I have no wish to assure you to obtain [?] knowledge
Concerning you until it is perfectly agreeable to you
to furnish me with it , but I should exceedingly like
to receivE from You a Newspaper — Gazetter or old
number of the United Service Journal._ it would be
to a great "Spiritual" Curiosity
9888
I will send you one.
You have mentioned [C??ydon] but also other
Places. —
For a very long tine I had not the least
idea who you were. — but I am really at
present in such a position that I cannot be
known by any right name
58
I only wish to receive a paper as a proof that you are
Realy a living person & capable of Communicating by
these means with another — I hope you will keep
your promise
9889
I will
I mentioned to you the MS I am receivEving from a Spanish
Monk.— I was much surprised to find one of the
Seals he gavE me a couterpart of the [?] Seal givEn
by Rabbi Solomon — the Spirits names , + the [?]
names of GOD.
9890
Probably all copied from the same work
I think that the oldest of these things
has ben found out of Spanish Mss , but
there in Spain it is kept so perfectly
 a secret because the law has always been
so severe upon those who have been
discovered practicing Sorcery.
I am king with the Miss Leighs to the Crystal
Palace on Good Friday — I dont know the Charge
but I suppose You cannot be there on so vulgar
a day.—
9891
Oh its a [?], and theres to be the band
of the Colstream Guards, theres various
attractions I believe.
You must not expect to see us arrive in the [?]
Colored Carriage and [?] horses — You formerly
thought was mine.
9892
That was not a Mistake, I beg to say it
was your own Assertion — I Dont know
any thing at all about the grounds.

Is there any particular picture we can look at
say at 1/2 past 3.

9894   There is a photographic Gallery ag't the
other rooms and in it the likeness of a
person that I know.

I should presume a great many "Crimeans"

9895   Its a Lady
Pray what is the number & we will there at 1/2 past 3

9896   They were not numbered when I was
there and I think they have changed
their places — She is in mourning and
I think its a nice handsome one.

Is the Photo Gallery near the picture Gallery

9897  Adjoining one of the rooms
this Lady came over from Spain with
Georgina when she was in London last
You will see that she has a Spanish
Countenance and light hair

Is it in Colors

9898   the dress is mourning so theres no Colors

& the face tinted

9899   Yes

At 1/2 past 3 then we will be there.

9900   You might make it half past 4, I
cannot tell you its exact position because
I know they Alter their pictures

Selina says perhaps you will bring NH

9901   I dont know him, if I did I shouldnt
like to be seen there in bad Company.

I say [s] bring little "Zeno" instead

9902   they won't let dogs in— .
Perhaps You mean to insinuate if they
let puppies in - they might.
I suppose you take a trip to Italy
60
And a few oranges with you

I will ask Dr M. to meet us there

9903   If you are going to write to Doctor M
to go there tell him to call me if he can
before that time — if you write to night

he will get it   time enough to see me.

Good Evening—. 
Good Evening Miss 
10 PM 
Called 10 HN
No Vision 
Same house April 8th 1857. 
7.40. PM. in Ms Leas New Mirror did” to Mesino. 
Miss Emma Xoinia Specalatrix 
Freckled Ellesine. 
Ellesnio is here. 
Mrs Lea has had this mirror made as closely as 
possible in accordance with your instructions 
he requested to be informed if it meets your 
wishes. 
9908 
I am well satisfied and in begining 
with it this night. I trust most serve 
nlly to convenience a series of interviews 
which shall be as beneficial to him 
whom I would protect, as the office is 
pleasing to me. 
Agreeable to your wish, my seer and myself 
are here this evening to inaugurate this 
new mirror which has been daily dedicated 
to you. 
9909 
I will do my best to appear as plain 
as possible. 
As in picture Mr Lea, will alone invoke you 
and his wife Mrs Charlotte Lea will perform
the office of seer, may we request your kind
assistance in developing her faculty of [discerning?]
of Spirits
I thank you for doing your best to [aid?]
me in my [endeavors?] to communicate
with my charge. . and I have at the
same time a favor to ask for him and
for me. The fulfilment of it must rest
with you. I am quite sure that you will
do all you can in receiving that which
you believe to be to his advantage—four
times a year on the [sixth?] day of every
third month. I would most willingly
appear in this mirror to your seer. To
communicate through her with Mrs
Lea. To give on those. To me peculiar evening,
a vision connected with him which
would otherwise be [unc?ble] to be seen.
Mrs Lea has not and never will have
the power of vision. To penetrate by sight
things that may be prescribed. Those
things which belong to the higher
and more internal place of Spirit
I will do my best to meet your wishes on [?]
all of my friend—on a former evening you
kindly promised to to favor Mrs Lea with a
copy of a Spiritual Work entitled "The
Past and Future. he earnestly requested you
to fulfil the promise on a future evening.
I will try to do so. There are many very
many Doctrines that I would urge,
things that I would say [?] that
I would instill into him that would
be easier to be received at once in the
form of a book than to be given by questions 
63
and he would always have it carry at 
as a record to instructs he might refer. 
May I ask our wheit days you prefer to 
be invoked for that purpose. 
9912 
I invoked wishs him to devote Tuesday 
Evening and on those evenings to use 
nothing else to call with his thoughts 
only directed to that object and to receive 
that which appears with a certain deter. 
mination to judge wether it be the 
Truth by his reaction and understanding 
I will do my best to appear when called 
on those evenings, and on the 6th day of 
every third month he may look forward 
to receiving clearly and plainly the most 
important thins that I can give. 
for you must be aware that it would 
be impossible to hold that communion 
and speak at that length, or give it 
with that interest through an imperfect 
seer, or one who secretly sees at will as 
through one whose vision is feeling develop 
act. 
As it would be a cource of great interest will 
Seer that his wifes Spiritual secretly should 
be developed, we feel source of your kind endurance 
on her behalf 
9913 
The best that can be done by me, I will 
do for believe me it is my wish as well 
as his that a perfect unity should take 
place between those who desire enter 
course of Man with Spirit, I would than 
desire were more universal that we 
were we cures to the hearts of those we love 
se well. and with whose spiritual 
64

welfare we are so intimately connected
hereafter, and yet the inscrutable ways
of Divine Providence are well. for were
men to desire that hearty communion
with those above them, Sin would be
banished and happiness would not
be injoyed - the tempter would lose his
power and good Angels alone would
be the guide of man.

May I remark that the Atmospheric Spirits
of living mortals appearing more freely clear
and plainer tend to develop the faculty of
Spirit seeing may I ask your advice as to
Mr. Leas calling them

9914
The do. It would be well for him to devote
another mirror to that subject, for it would
be best to keep this one for my appearance
and to such visions as I may show
Fridays and Mondays would be the
best for such calling, and I should
advise you when calling the Atmospheric
Spirit of a living person to appear
before you always and without fail
to use thos significant words
If convenient and Agreeable.
Much mischief has been done by neglecting
this by persons calling into the
mirror or the Crystal those who are
unwilling or unable to appear.,
unconsciously on the part of the
caller by his omitting to use such
words.

You kindly promised Mr Lea another Seal to use
with his Mirror is it convenient for you to give it us
this Evening as my Seer is here to copy it -

65

9915 
My Seal is engraved on this stone.

10' past 8. Ellesmo shared the Seal & Miss Leigh Copied it
Will you favor me with the English letter of the
Hebrew on the Seal that I may more accurately Copy
them.

9916
It is a name - the great name of GoD.

Is Mr Lea to make a Copy to wear also instead of the one
You formerly gave him

9917
The one I have just given is more powerful
and is for the purpose of more closely [??iting]
Mr Lea with me.

Should it be made on the back of the former one or
distinct

9918
I should like him to make it and cover it
so that it might not be seen or noticed by
any other person and then wear it about
him.

If it is necessary for me to make the Seal more perfect
will you appear to my seer at Croydon where called

I will

9919
I would rather make a point of giving the
Evidence of my Creed when next you call
if by that time Mr Lea's vision is not
sufficiently clear to receive it without interruption
we will devote an evening to it and
[?] give it in the form of a little book
There is another piece of advice that
I think he would profit by, be careful to
note down on paper all that appears +
and to write as far as you possibly
can every word and sentence that appears
in your Mirror for on a second perusal
you will see perhaps a deeper meaning
than might catch the ear You will
find more [?] in the discourse and 
66
more interest should any thing Come
too fast request it to be slower. - and if slow
enough to be tedious solicit it to become
plainer and quicker and parting [cularly] I
must earnestly commend you to the Keeping
of Him in whose sight we are both weak
and depend not on me but on him.

I here requested that Mrs. Lea might be allowed to
take the seers place to see if her vision improved
which she did - & Ellesmo appeared to her much plainer
& more distinct than ever before but seemed to her a
long way off tho' to my seer who also inspected
at the same time Ellesmo appeared quite large
& close to the front of the Mirror - whilst Mrs. Lea
inspected I requested on any future Evening to give
in this New Mirror - responses to Ms Lea's questions
Even if Mrs. L. could not see the Spiritual visions
distinct & these appeared to her.

9920
I have never given a response or answer
to any question in the Mirror without my
Presence. Since I became the Guardian
Spirit of Ms Lea
I would now if it meets your wishes as
well as mine that your seer should now
take her seat.

My Seer then resumed her seat & I requested as we
read half an hour longer to inspect that we might
be favored with a Spiritual Vision to which Ellesmo
replied "follow me to my home."

9921
The Vision
Now Ellsmo's rising there's a ray of
golden light comes down. shining from the top
obliquely - the width of his figure he is going
up backwards his feet is this way he is
67
ascending head foremost & slightly backwards
the stones on his head & waist are beautiful &
brilliant - now the light is getting under and
speading more over the Mirror - and across the
ray of light there are some gates - the gates have
a beautiful pattern, but its only a darker or yellower
light - Now the pattern of the gates is changing
into all colors just like the Rainbow - the
gates open an Ellesmo gets nearer  - now he has
gone through. and there are two forms inside
one standing on each side of a path. - they
look like Marble except their moving - and
their hair is light and their drapery very clear
and very bright, their heads feet & faces are
just like Marble - their wings tinted with
pink - they stand on each side of the path
 and bow their heads. forward to each other
so as to make an arch and on the path on
which they stand is an open book. EllesMo
puts his foot on the book and is gone under.
the arch. they make. he is gone through
he has taken up the book, closes it and
and holds it in both hands between his two
thumbs and fingers - and goes on with it.
Now he has gone under another archway, that
is also of a golden pattern. and under it are
a great many figures - a great many Children
and all very light & beautiful - they are indeed
very beautiful - There are 4 of the smallest
standing on the Top of a very high pedestal
rising up to speak. they stand there close
together and one before [?], the one that
is in front, slants forward
on the pedestal is some reading
9922
"The Emblem of the most exalted Truth The perfection of knowledge - The family and the one all powerful who is (it?) supported in influenced by ought save His own will."

Next round the pedestal there are seven figures close to the foot of the pedestal - The Children are surpassingly lively and beautiful their hair is golden and falls down long over their [?] which are as white as white can be and their little white arms are twined round each other and the three on the pedestal have white stones round their hair and the bands in back of their heads are joined to each other.
9923 The seven figures round the pedestal are children not much larger than those on the pedestal.
9924
In the first circle are Seven
In the Second twenty
The third Seventeen
The fourth twenty two
The fifth twenty seven
The sixth thirty two
The two nearest the pedestal are young - The others grown up. All in white but there next the outside have their [?] edged with white theres a little color on all except those on the pedestal -

[symbol for Mars] die 21 April 1857. 1/2 past 8 PM
Invoked the CA
The CA is here as usual
Last Tuesday CA & my seer being on a visit to Mr Lea - I
Invoked Ellermo on his new mirror - & unfortunately my
seer having a bad cold I am prevented [receing?] your
Esteemed work as reading it [?] exhaust her so much
but I have called you now to explain the circumstances

2744
9925
I am pleased you have called me this
Evening for I wished to come
Since I was here last on Tuesday week
I am aware that you have been unwell
it is of that I would speak -
When I advised you to go to Dr [??son]
I was confident of his skill from his success
in so many cases and altho he seems to
have done you no good, my high opinion is
not changed of him as a physician
I am aware that you have intended to
adopt another mode of treatment, and if
[?lated] well to yourself it may be of service
but why I have interfered is because hither to
I have known [what] that you have been
doing what is best but feeling now that
you may turn too strictly to the ruler of
homeopathy and hydropathy I have
spoken a word now 
70

2744  9925   In a case such as yours the use of cold water 
is beneficial only when applied externally do 
not upon any account drink it - it only 
strengthens you when so applied  if you at 
the same time take strengthening food & drink 
unless such be taken the whole system is 
so weakened as to be unable to stand [the] 
attacks of any violence  when they occur, and 
thus it is that so many who advocate [it &] the
treatment and consistently practice it die
even in health for they cannot stand the 
shock of a violent attack of any kind of 
disease.
    I believe your complaint to be caused 
by the overstraining of the vessels of the stomach 
in consequence of which they are much 
contracted & weakened   that every thing 
taken of a poor and sloppy nature tends 
further to aggravate it by weakening them 
still more and that the more stimulating 
and strengthening the food and drink you 
take the more easily will you rid yourself 
of it and that on medicines alone nothing 
depends. - 
     You would find any thing better do you 
good and time.  The use of the water 
externally is strengthening, if you encrease the 
amount of nourishment taken.  otherwise 
it is certainly weakening -
      I know that you did not call me for 
this but for this I insisted to come 

I replied & asked if I shd take some [?] in 
a glass of wine with my lunch.

2745   9926   I do not know of any kind of medicine 
but I have sought to know of what might
71
benefit you. and I will seek [?h??] further 
and next Tuesday week, I will tell you 
if  there be any particular one of more
benefit than what you have mentioned
Will you then [f??r] me on Tuesday with the book.
[*7*] 2746 Yes I will

     An extract of [gen?ion] would be as good a
2748     thing as you could take and I must
              that [??th] can I time it will be completely
9929     removed.

              That would do you a great deal of good
              if you keep a sufficient quantity of
2749     strength, but unless the support is

Invoked the CA. 
I must having been to Wo still—& his remarks as 
to my showing symptoms of approaching paralysis 
2755 
9936 
God grant that you may speedily 
recover—It was not paralysis that 
neared and with precaution I think 
that certainly will not [seeke place] happen 
you cannot do better tank go on with 
this method pronded as I have before 
said you do not allow the stomach to 
be extracted and the digestive organs 
to remain inactive for any tine 
& receive the book 
2756 
9937 
I would willingly show the book but 
I have not the power to make it very 
plain this Evening. 
then as my Seer Suffers very much when Seeing 
indistinctly we will with your permission 
defer it until next Tuesday Evening 
2757 
9938 
Various causes extraneous from her. 
May I be permitted to ask an explanation 
of such causes. 
73

2758
9939
The power may be obtained, it is
possible to overcome the difficulties but
not now. I will try and make the book
as plain as possible next Tuesday Evg
and when I am at liberty to do so
I will tell you why it is sometimes
plainer than at others. and a general
rule for making it more clearly
perceptible to the seer.

Dr [Ashbo??her?] has invited me to a Seance with
Ms Randolph the American Medium to see some
spirit manifestations but being so unwell I
am not inclined to go.

2759
9940
Your state of health will not permit
you to go, and were it otherwise it
would not be advisable, although
keeping yourself unconnected with
them or their mode of communion you
might be a spectator and witness
without injury for I would always
as I have hitherto done advocate free
opinion upon Every subject, and give
you the chance. through my consent
of hearing things that are contrary
to those given by myself, at the
same time firmly believing that
the truth of mine by its own merit
would bring them off victorious were
they placed in ever such comparison
with the false doctrines of Evil

Since I have placed myself in Spiritual matters
under your guidance I would not think of
[M??p?] [rupping?] manifestations without your Sanction

2760
9941
I have no objection to your witnessing
the manifestations but do not you 
74

2760
9941
Actually sit down and join hands
with those who cause the motion of
the Tables. do not ask them to operate
on you. by moving your hand or a
pen in it or any thing that may be
suggested do not ask them to
answer your menial questions, for believe
me the law that allows them to do this
also allows them to take a hold of
the spiritual body that may not easily
be taken off.
It will be sufficiently [conduced]
convincing to you. to see these things
performed with others who desire it and
are convinced of its truth. and who
will not open their Eyes to its defects
and inconsistencies

Dr A. has requested permission to show your two
MS. volumes to his friends

2761
9942
There cannot be any objection.
I only hope it has made an effect
upon him that will cause him to
think deeply upon the subject that
it contains not that he may value
it because it is marvellous or curious
but because it contains something
closely and vitally connected with
himself & his fellow beings that is
necessary for all to dwell upon

If any &c.

2762
9943
I have nothing particular to say to
you this Evening but if any question
arises in your mind without any
Effort I will willingly answer it
respecting any thing
75

I mentioned when [seized?] with giddiness it always
brought the CA strongly to my mind.

2763
9944
It is almost needless for me to say
that I will do so. we must put our
trust in a being far abler & mightier
than me

any thing you may propose.

I returned thanks and requested the book.

2770
9950
I cannot give it you this Evening but I will
the next time I appear, I am not
prepared with it to night for there is great
excitement in the Spirit world, and in the
Atmosphere great changes are taking
place - they have been about for the last
5 years of your time - and they will
soon come to a climax
An agitation unknown before prevails
and when it subsides all will be again
calm as before All our Energy is required

You mention your not being "prepared with the book"
May I ask. If the book be not already written
or do you prepare it for each Evening =

2771
9951
The book exists in its        as it is
but it is not in the characters you
can read.

May I ask the cause of the Agitation you
mention now operating in the Spiritual world

2772
9952
I cannot answer it now, on the same
Evening that I tell you why your visions
are sometimes clear and bright and
at others indistinct & clouded - I will
tell that for it is connected  and
when tranquility is restored the cause
will be removed and the Effects of
that cause gone, and then Spirit Sight
will be more general more [?] :
77

some excitement has been occasioned by the [?]
of the approaching Comet probably striking the
Earth may I ask if the Atc. Spirits of the inhabitants
of this Earth also [?] Entertain such a belief

2773
9953
They think the same as the men they
represent, we are aware of it and are also
perfectly conscious of the folly of those
who fear the destruction of the Earth
because supposing they should meet
it would only envelope the Earth in a
kind of [?], for not being substance
it could not strike it with force -- from
that heat some vegetation would probably 
be destroyed but such a thing will 
not happen.

May I ask if you will favor us with a Vision
or if we can see Mr. Anderson.

2774
9954
It is quite impossible for me to show 
you a Vision or I would immediately
do so
   There is no objection to your calling
Mr Anderson 
Shall I call him in this or the box Mirror 
2775 
9955 
In the box mirror 
I hope I may look forward to having a continuation 
of the book next Tuesday Evening 
2776 
9956 
Yes if you inspect the Mirror I will 
show it for I shall be able. 
Can we see Capt Baston this Evening, Safely 
2777 
9957 
I do not know whether he can appear 
this Evening—If you cannot see him 
After calling I will give you some 
information about it when I appear 
again. 
78
You must not feel disappointed about the
book for there is plenty of time for you
to receive it in—
10’ to 9 the CA left 
Oral Mirror 
Called Mr Anderson 
he is here black hat, his coat buttoned up black 
recovers. 
We are happy to see you this Evening, it it a long 
time since we met. 
9958 
These opportunities seem rare now. I wish 
you good Evening 
I mentioned my suffering from spasms & 
9959 
That is dreadful 
I should think your mind has been 
overtasked. did not Dr Ellertson benefit 
you. 
I am now laying Homeopathy. 
9960 
Oh I dont think that does any one any 
good, it is all fancy, at least as far 
as their Medicines concerned. they 
succeed more than the allopaths 
because they are more particular in 
their instructions as to loving Exercise 
and so on. 
I will now show you the Manuscript that the 
Spanish Jwar is giving my Seer.=—what 
do you think of these seals.— 
9961 
Have you any idea of the meaning of the 
faces. 
If there had been 3 heads instead of 
two I have seen something similar 
to it. 
There is a good deal in the small 
79

Space within the circle, I suppose you
want it the size of the original or
it might be done quicker on separate
leaves and the book would be all the
better for it.

O bye the bye I have a quarrel to pick with you
about the picture, we went to the Crystal palace
and looked all over the Photographic Gallery
but could not find it

9962
O I know all about it - & so's Mackenzie
but I will have it out with him yet
If he does not go to a few places after
me my name is not what it is,
how I do hate his inquisitive ways
you would be rather surprized at the
questions he asks me. sometimes, and
the old lady, oh [law?] oh dear

You mean his Mother I suppose

9963
Yes. - She comes into my Crystal
with him sometimes, the time before
last they came he told me he was
going to Croydon to fetch your Japan
Crystal for his mother to see it. and
he was also borrowing your books over
again for her inspection as she was
very curious.
She told me how much she should
like to see You and how much
surprized she was she had not been
asked to go.
The further you are off the better
for she is awful and what is worse
she is not blessed with such a quick
understanding as her Son inquiring
more and comprehending less
80
D'Mackenzie has been informed that in about a year
& a half he will have the faculty & he is now trying to
develope it

9964
But he will make a mess of it first
All these things are best kept quiet, quiet as
quiet can be, depend upon it no good comes
of making a noise abroad 

Now I will pick my quarrell. We all went on
to the Crystal palace. & searched the photographic Gallery
over but could find no portrait answering the descptn,
you gave us. - & we looked about for you -

9960
Well it is there and I saw several people
but none answering your description and
as for the lady it has got "portrait"
underneath it and it is the real likeness
of a living person
It's in black this likeness is done in 
black. and she was in mourning at
the time She has a Spanish countenance
and light hair., large Eyes and a rather 
wide mouth.
The Photographic Gallery it is called
There is no name underneath this it
only says "Portrait"
did you not see a duchess there ag. 
one of the private doors leading out of
that gallery.

Is it square or oval

9966
I think the frame and all is about
7 or 8 meter square - you see those on
the shelf in this room

do you mean [time] mine on the Mantlepiece

9967
Yes they are done in the same style
only better more delicately shaded and
larger 
81 

9967   Talking about photographs I was told in 
my mirror that if I procured the apparatus
an impression could be taken of a party 
appearing in the Mirror   Supposing Such 
to be placed in a peculiar light under 
Certain Circumstances   
     I have not tried it supposing it ridiculous
they are not real Enough, but I certainly 
made that objection, and I was 
answered that it was the appearance 
not the reality of the man that was 
taken off.—
     It is strange but that would [not] 
decide or not if it was possible whether 
the object exists to the Eye only or whether 
they were actually present compressed 
by the Spirit power into the necessary 
Size of the glass they were exhibited in 

did you obtain any practical instructions 

9968    No I really did not enquire because 
at the time I took scarcely any notice
of it   I thought it so completely 
beyond Common Sense or rather beneath. 
   You may explain it to the others, for we are 
Certain only a visible body can be shown 

I explained 

9969    I have thought that those things used 
in Common by all men and governed 
by the laws of Nature are unalterable 
and unchangeable, but that these  
peculiar & mysterious things that are 
only enjoyed by one out of a many &
are confined and limited are concerned
solely by spirit and spirit power.  
I had alluded to the "Spirit hands" being made not
only visible but palpable - to several of my friends
82

And it is the question whether the
natural laws and the spiritual laws
can be brought together. or agree. were,
such a thing to take place as a spiritual
likeness to be embodied by Photography.
the laws of nature would be made
subservient to the will of spirit, the two
would be united and then man & spirit
would be no longer kept apart they
would become familiar objects the one
to the other., they would be attracted
to each other through being visible &
plain and not repulsive as at present
and being unknown & fraught with
terror - depend upon it it is not so.

I will explain the subject to the CA. & obtain his
opinion & if you will do the same we can give
Each other the result.

9970
I have no objection to do that. but (a)
these hands you perceive to be Evil,
at least I do.

Of course I believe so to & that is why I have always
declined [?] those manifestations

9971
Then we are told that Evil is very
different in its power & its made of
Manifestation - and it becomes a question
if such a thing were possible whether
the likeness were Evil or good how can
you govern it - but there I can say
nothing, I will ask for you, it would
be the most wonderful thing that has
been accomplished yet I have been
Enquiring about the expense of an apparatus
& can't get one to answer under ₤5.
83
If I can Succeed in obt'g the requisite instructions I
will get an apparatus — I cannot conceive any thing
more interesting than thus obtaining the portraits
of those we call into our Mirrors & Crystals

9972   But I believe it related to news in the
Spirit world as well as figures
And yet they tell us that these things
do not really exist there to mortal sight
that if a man was taken there wide
awake he would see nothing but a vast
Empty space , how then can it be shown
to us here.—
     Its no use I cannot Reconcile it, I
get thicker in than Ever.

9973   There are some old fellows who would deny
that Even if they were to see it done.
Well I will enquire more.

Suppose we tell Mackenzie about it

9974   I think he is well out of it for a little
while.

9975   I am not surprized at his being anxious
about it. neither should I be surprized
if he loses it altogether , for the Ridiculous
way he sets about it when he gets his
Crystal. — First his boy gets frightened
through seeing him get so excited
and then he lays his hands on the
top as though he was coming to swallow
it and the boy gets more alarmed then
as soon as the boy sees something
84

in it Mackenqie darts at it again, + 
looks himself with another question ready 
without giving any being time to answer
then the boys nervous system receives
another shock and his hair stands on
end. You would laugh if you could 
see them and last of all the boy doesn't 
know quite clearly what he does see 
and then theres doubts + crosses and
strokes and yesses and noes. beyond 
them + then they put it away.

I find much difficulty in getting Capt Benton into
the Mirror + I do not like to call urgently. not knowing
his present condition - I wish you wd bring him in as
you used formerly to be able to do.

9976
so I could now. - not him as I know 
of because he is beyond water.
 
It is still inconceivable to me why [?] Spirits dislike
"Crossing Water"

9977
Because in travelling over the Earth you
keep under the clouds and between the 
clouds and the sea. there is quite a diff.t
Atmosphere. from that over the land.

how is it you appear so quickly to my call. Sometimes
you are here in less than a minute.

9978
Time is no more than space You expressed 
a wish to see me I am on land and near
you - I was agreeable to come in + ready
and when I fetch others in it is not that 
I actually travel in Spirit after them 
It is in the same expressed wish that 
you give when you call for me. but
through my being a Spirit it has 
more power and nets where you might 
jail.
85

I used to see Capt Benton in my Evani Glass but
I [haved?] Mr Dresser's At Spirit boxed up there a long
time & I am afraid to use it lest he should annoy 
me again. 

9979   It is very probable he is altered now.
I dont know how to account for it.
I do not know whether the answer I rec'd
is satisfactory or not  Shall I tell you
what I was told.

Yes.  be so good

9980   That these beings in the Atmosphere were
not living intelligences, having a separate
existance and changing every moment
as we do but that they are the images
of us placed by the power exercised over
them by the Almighty in such a position
as to bear testimony of our actions to be
a record by wch we may be judged
and that while we are in a progressive
or a Regenerating state they remain still
that is to say if we do a bad action
they represent it, if we go gradually
from that bad action to repentance and
then from repentance to the Contemplation
of a good one and from the contemplation
to the actual doing of a good deed
the representation of the bad action is
obliterated & their condition is changed
at once into the semblance of us as we
then are.  good and true.  and thus in
all minor things it is not until after
we have attained as far as we can
attain knowledge of a subject that they
leap at once from ignorance to full possession

86 
of our alcheriment and have all the 
advantage at once that we have gained by 
long studying and much thought. 
as it is now late we must close. I wish you good bye 
9981 
Good night and I hope your wealth 
will be impras before I come again. 
Mr A left. 5 past 10 PM. 
♂24 June 1857 C A mirror 
Invoked the C A. 
4 past 8 PM. 
I explained the Photopathic method of manipulation 
and asked if it could be applied to the taking of 
the Visions received thro our Mirrors & Crystals. 
2778 
9982 
The time is not far off when such a thing 
will be done, but not the actual transactions 
of spirits shown but views which they 
themselves prevent in material form. 
May I ask if you can form mw with the receiving 
instructions for performing so desirable an object 
2779 
9983 
the time is not come yet 
It could only be done so far as this 
You could take the likeness of the image 
that they presented in exactly the same 
manner as you now copy the reading 
that I present to you. 
2780 
9984 
Spirit Scenes must be transformed 
into material bodies [befo] by those who. 
showed them before it would be possible 
87
for man to see them or copy them as a
material object
2781
9985
You would not know that I was present
you would not know of those scenes unless
they were visible to the Eye, and the Sun
could not make a shadow of what was
not a body.
2782
9986
There was not then
2783
9[8]987
I will
It has never been done Yet and at present
it is impossible but spirits are able now
to demonstrate themselves in a way that
a short time back was impossible
Such changes are taken place in the
one world and the other as to throw open
what has been hitherto impassable
When such is completed further demonst.ns
will take place , And when Spirit and
Man are become perfect in their union
and each are familiar with the doings
of the other. the reign of peace shall
be began the sign of the End of all
drawing near. And to become so familiar
with Man as for him to see with.
Material eye in his home, & Even in his
streets the appearances that we alone
can present to him would be a very
great step towards the accomplishment
of his purpose.—  That step passed
there would be little else to do. The
Dr. John Chambers

Time is not come yet , but soon will
If any &c
2784
I shall have a word to say to you next

8th. July 1857
C. A Mirror
Invoked the CA.
May I ask a few questions this Evening
90
2780
do so I will Answer them willingly
When taken so suddenly as I was on * die last in
the spect my thoughts naturally revert to you
Are You the [a] near me & Cognizant of what happens
2787
9991
I am always near you You must not
, at least to say you must not is perhaps
asking more than is possible. — but you
must strive against nervousness as far
as you possibly can , the sensation is
of Cours very bad and alarming but
the danger from it is not so great as
you apprehend.
There is a possibility of the Doctor
whose work on that subject you have read
being [?] to do Something for [you?], if
you feel Confidence in him it would be
best to ask his Advice , but I think
the best means of relieving it depends
upon Yourself and not upon medicine
I think that Early [?] moderate
exercise regular & wholesome food continually
taken Strengthening & stimulating liquors
89

would do more for your complaint than
physics

I was unfortunately una.ble to invoke last Tuesday
May I ask the favor of the promised "Word"
you had to say to me.

2788   9992   I knew that you would be asked to 
lend a sum of money to a party that
comes from your fathers neighbourhood
I was also quite certain that you w'd
never have it returned.

My we request the favor of hearing the book
this Ev'g.

2789  [99]92   I am unprepared with it this Evening

May I have it next Tuesday

2790   [99]94   Yes

Eltesmo the other Evening in prescribing for Mr Lea
said Portwine & [Bark] hops would do good.  have
I your permission to try

2791  [99]95  Do so.

May I ask how Eltesmo became aware of their
properties

2792   9996   He has seen its effects on those who
have been under his care -- it is a good
thing in many complaints when the
stomach is weak.

May I ask You the Name of my Seer's G.S

2793  [99]97  T R E S E V

May I ask his order or degree

2794   [99]98   The third sphere

Is he good and Faithful

2795  [99]99  Yes but his knowledge is very limited

Shall I call him in this or the Oval Mirror

2796  [10,]000   You can call him in this if you wish it

I thank you  I only with to call him so far

90 
As it would benefit my Seer 
2797 
He could kill the nature of his complaints 
Could he appear this Evening 
2798 
You could Call him 
With your sanction I should like to Call him 
2799 
he will appear then and you can ask 
him 
Are you aware of the Sangimany Revolt in 
India that has so Suddenly broken out 
2800 
We are and there will be a fearful 
Struggle before it is brought to an end 
10,004 
Such things cause a commotion in the 
Spirit world that you cannot underst.  
it is repulsive and horrible to as 
that such thins should be, for 
although the spirit that comes out 
of a mantilaled corpse is as pure and 
as perfect as that which leaves an 
infant still it has a tale to tell. 
A work to perform with us that is 
far different to the one whose End has 
been calon. 
2801 
Those who work in a wrong cause but 
rarely succeed I cannot sufficiently 
express my dislike of the motives for which 
they go. 
If they have time & Education to 
Spare there are plenty in their own 
land at their own downsteps dieing 
body & soul for the want of it and it 
would be far better to give the greatest 
91

2801
10,006
Charity that of the mind unostentatiously
to those - than for a man to go to a foreign 
Country to display the little that he has 
to make a hero of himself and to return with
the story of his achievements - they take
[Misery?] to the sand on which they are
presumptuous Enough to believe they do good
they tear the veil of the Godhead before the 
Eyes of the heathen, then dare them to look at 
it and tell them there is no hope, when had
he remained in ignorance of the mystery of
GOD it remains alone between him & his master
to settle the account as the greatest of the
two shall see fit - He is merciful and he also
is just.
It was in the power of Him who
allowed that frailty to be, to have given
strength. if he has deserved it shall he
famish for the want of it - No - unEarthly
father with all his weakness does not
punish his child for being unable to answer
a question that his matured intellect
proposes and understands how much less
then should he who is a father of all
strength - all mind - and that mind
not made of compounds but of one glorious
whole the perfection of truth.

I thanked the CA & referred to my [attacks?].

2802
10,007
I will leave now and you must be
assured under Every circumstance I am
all to you that I can be - It needs no

(Omitted) Corydon. 13 July. 1857
& 20PM  I worked [Ettsom?].
Ellesmer is here.
Dx the evening that I at first appeared, the [fst.]day of the 
3rd month. is of peculiar importance to the subjects that I then
[treat?] upon. , I cannot [?] this Evening the same as I should have
given then. but on the next time when another period has elapsed 
I can lay before you that which I should have given last
[Suns sign} du Odu' Evening
I am pleased to meet you tonight under any case
pleased to have an opportunity of addressing you altho' not on
the subject I had intended.
The Seal can be finished this [evening?] and should it
be possible for us to meet again on the 6th of 
October it will be
ready for use.  such a meeting must rest with the Great 
[disporer?] of [?] , for life and death so nearly meet and
the passage from one into another is so short & uncertain
that no human being knows when his hour draws
nigh and it often happens that they who are expecting it
every time live the longest and those who have youth
and hope are cut down and wither as the grass.
(as to [Leon?] [?]
I do not think that he should do so, without
the sanction of his medical advisor constitutions are so
different that the system you are under I should not advise
for him and whilst he is taking the bath he should take
proper medicine.
If he hopes every man to prepare for the worst, God
knows, there is no danger for the present, but far be it
from me to place upon you an anxiety for care without reason
or cause.
Be careful of your self keep the body strengthened
and stimulated for that is most necessary.  I think that very
much might be prevented if you take regularly a moderate
quantity, say a lone glass of [?] with a tablespoonful of 
the hop boiled into a liquor, a strong extract of it, not [?]
or adulterated with any thing could take of in the morning without
ill effect.
(of [?])
Yes - not exactly with it, if he prefers either before or after 
the stomach must receive fine, it is good for many people
and I believe it will be beneficial for you (Flt.)  you are aware
I believe it can do you no harm it stimulates the [digestive?]

The C A is here in white  deep black border all round
the dress.  & sleeves.
A friend has lent me this book & as I find my case 
so clearly described I intend with your sanction
to consult him

2810   10,023   I would seek his advice
If I know of any thing that would
relieve it I would most willingly give it
you, but I cannot.

I will as speedily as my health will allow [?] copy
your esteemed work. & I hope eventually publish it

2811   10,024   It will not do to publish it yet
It wants a preface, an introduction and a 
concluding book., and were it to be
published the account of the Vision had
better not be attached to it
     The introduction would do instead
At present while in Your state of health
it would do you harm.  to study it closely
and you have need to do so to make the
alterations required
     You must not attempt to [?] 
your brain with thought when it is so
95

illfitted to bear it - rest now will make it 
stronger hereafter when your complaint 
and I trust that may be before long, is 
greatly relieved if not cured.
     We will wait patiently and in the 
coarse of the ensuing winter we may get 
together the entire materials for a book 
and when what you have now is completed 
you can begin to think about revising it.

I have not yet [fair?] copied the latter portions of your 
work. but when that is done I will revisit and 
any objections which may arise I will at a future 
time when you are inclined to favor me seek the 
explanation

2812   10,025    I shall always have an inclination 
but am unable to do it at any time 
you or I may desire. I am influenced 
by passing events.

I mentioned my regret at the mutiny in India 
& more particularly the  barbarities that had been enacted 
and that I presumed from a former response it 
must occasion much commotion in the Spirit World

2813   10,026   It does indeed,  sadness and sorrow. 
that so many beings each blessed with 
the special Endowment of Divinity 
should pass from life into death & leave

2814   10,028   I understand you

I have now in my hands Mrs Croslands new 
book on Spiritualism  called "Light in the Valley"

2815   10,029   I see it   it is done by the peculiar
Spirits who have made through her
and other Mediums their Communications
by writing

May I place this plate "       "
against the mirror & request your opinion

2816   10,030   I do not know what they mean by
such a likeness it can only be copied by
them from other works or from their own
Ideas.

I placed the plate "
ag't the Mirror

2817   10,031   I see it such a thing must appear
97
Absurd to an unprejudiced mind that
considers it strange and peculiar & varied
as the forms of all Spirits are.— his likeness
cannot be different and Remains unchanged
Cannot be givEn by them because never seen
Cannot be conceived because their being
is not high enough to be in affinity with his

I placed the plate "Christ amongst the Spheres"
agt. the mirror — page 152
2818
10,032
A better conception Certainly only their 
spheres are not the right one — it is strange
that these Spirits should Choose such
a subject but it is not the [?] here. that
they frequently do so. they have a purpose
and that mode of operation leads toward
the attainment. of it [for they] for they at
the very beginning lead the parties they
Communicate with down a false Step

But at the same time they givE no clear
Conception of Either his name or his office

I will tell you why they do this
The greatest sin that man can Commit
and the most exquisite punishment
that he can receive for it arises from
his knowledge of Christ and from his
profaning it and blaspheming him
better that he should be as ignorant
98
2821
10,035
As the veriest brute in Creation. , better
that he should worship an idol or bow
down to a stone or die in the belief of no
God.. _  for when once man knows of a
Christ believing him to be the Son of
GOD. and then acts regardless of that
knowledge and belief, any direct disobed.ce
of the laws enforced by him , and is in
words a Christian but in acts a follower
of the opponent, he does all that he can
do to Sever the union between himself 
and good.—
By first teaching man to know
of Christ, and then perverting that
knowledge by showing him always in
the wrong light —proposing unreasonable
doctrines concerning him. and desiring
Man to lay down his Arms of freewill
and reason and believe in those doctrines
implicitly they work out quietly & slowly
their designs

10,036
The instrument is not punishable for
its work, it is they who being
unbiassed uncontrolled having the
power to decide one way or the other
who are judged

individually for publishing it, she was
desired to do so, and did it with a good
intention, and it is a curious work.  and 
to those who can read it passionless and
unprejudiced  it opens another page in
spiritual history,  and discovers to them
strange and interesting facts, and in
their minds strengthens & still more 
firmly establishes the foundation stone
of their faith and the only basis upon
which a lasting one can be found.

Is Tresev my Seer's GS.  a good & trustful spirit

2824   [10,0]38   Yes.

If any &c.

2825   10,039   Nothing more than that Mr. Lea's
GS. Eltesmo requested me to say that

                             Invoked the C A
7:45 PM.
Not being aware of Capt Bantons present position
I have been loath to call him -- but if you w'd
favor us with a Vision of him I sha be much
obliged

2826   10,040   You might see the likeness of him best
in the Evani Glass

Is Evani still the protector of the "Evani Glass

2827   10,041   Yes
100

Then with your permission I will do so this Ev'g

2828   10,042   You can do that on any other Evening 
than Tuesday.

I will take an opportunity of calling for a Vision on 
Friday if Evani will oblige me

2829   [10,0]43   I will ask him to do so.

May I ask for some information as to the last 5 
years commotion in the Spirit World.

2830   10,044    the Commotion still exists, when it has 
subsided we will speak of it.

At the same time you mentioned there was a Cause 
which operating on my Seer made her Vision 
differ so much in power & distinctness

2831   10,045    The answer to this question would also 
answer the first, for were spiritual 
intercourse thoroughly established such 
interruptions would never take place.

May I observe that in your Metaphysical Work 
you have given a simile from the Peach which 
I should like to read to you & request a further 
explanation.

2832  [10,0]46    Do so

I read the whole of the passage page

2833   10,047    My meaning was this
I should have likened the 3 existances 
to any other production of Nature the 
same. but I scarcely knew how to 
present a simile of their union more 
perfectly than in the peach because 
of its peculiar beauty and scent. & 
of its offensiveness afterwards while in the 
3 states of spirit[s] as in that. the 
same ground work remains
     The material in its perfect 
state presents to the eye nothing but
101
10,047
beauty freshness and a pleasing odour and
so it is the perfection of its kind the
highest state it can arrive at, therefore
pure spirit. When that pure spirit comes
to be used soiled mixed with extraneous
substance it still contains all the properties
of its nature — but the form of its perfection
is gone for ever , but all its good qualities
remain and are tried then the use of it
is known it is doing its work fulfilling
the purpose for which it is [lent] intended
in the second State then it is the Spiritual
and the material joined — then when it
is Eat its purpose Effected. the juice and
the Nourishment of it turned into the flesh
and the blood all the goodness extracted
and doing in a separate part its good
work.   the Rottenness that remains stronger
of the Essence of the fruit but without having
one particle of its virtue we can well
liken unto those who are stronger in
their power than we because in their
being their exists no obedience to the
orders of a superior.
If this is not quite intelligible
will you mention it in parts

I thank you
2834
10,048
It is meant to show that man exists
exactly between the two influences and
that each acts upon him as their centre
the one above and the other beneath his
Nature but in him they meet and by
him they are influenced

Ask the CA [& Wednesdays Theory] of the Spirits gloating over
the [?] of the [?].
102

2835
10,049
You speak as though matter was impenetrable
to spirits - if so how could the arm of the
medium be moved to write as their tongue
to speak.  And there are many instances
even of that - it is not many spirits but
one spirit that compress against the body
and partake of the interior, I did not
mention such a circumstance as generally
happening but it is what may and has
occasionally happened when a man has
lost his sense of good and given himself
up to bad actions or evil designs

I thank you  I will look to [?] statement
and again place the matter before you.

2836
10,050
The stomach could not confine them
it has been the theory of some that they
have lived in the body in the form of
worms or other animal intestine beings
which have been often found whose
entrance could never be accounted for. 

May a also observe that [to] your theory of the growth
of coal - [The] is opposed to all the [?] opinions
of geologists = may I read your statement & a
page from a book on Geology by a Christian minister

2837 do so

I read the C As theory, & page 178 of Dr Hitchcocks
work
have I made myself understood 


2838
10,052
You have
I differ but slightly from that author
and his argument must show that
in the transformation of trees into coal
103

10,052   Active Spirit must be employed in
every part of it must live in it to
change its substance.
     But I do not know whether he 
considers this Spirit to have been only
the working of the Almighty will
from a distance or whether it was really 
and truly inhabited by an Emanation
of his body however slight - 
     And again we agree that the Earth
was prepared as an Habitation for man
and for no other purpose  during the
time it was in the process of formation
such changes may have taken place
but I am certain that  the spirit wch
Effected such a change still dwells where
it stopped and that it cannot be
destroyed and is in unchangeable
existance because unless every thing even
the hardest stones were inhabited by
spirit they would crumble apart and be
as dust.
     Veins of different  material could
not run through the earth & keep
distinct from each other unless there
had been at the beginning & still was
some power to hold them together. &
keep them each in a separate form.

2839   10,053   On account of its minute quantity the
same kind of spirit that animates
the [minute] little creatures of the earth but
See Denton Jewels 
104

but in such a small proportion to the Material 
that it pervades, as only to have power 
enough to hold together and be. loose it 
of its bonds give it freedom in its own world 
its power returns and it can move.

2840   10,054    I do not for a moment mean that such a 
universal existance has divine intelligence 
or is endowed with the attributes of Him 
who bestowed on mankind his special 
gifts.

2841  10,055    They are not in any way connected with 
man.

 2842   10,056    These are, attraction exists in every thing 
and kind works upon kind, separate 
one substance as you will, take part of 
it to the furthermost regions of the earth, 
you do not break the thread that connects 
it with its own body, even if that other 
part is at the bottom of the Sea, and 
one law can be applied to every thing 
in Nature Animal Vegetable & Mineral 
Substances are alike - the same as the 
manipulations of the Mesmerists hand 
on the body of his patient cures an 
inward disease without teaching even 
the part affected.

You kindly promised me a "Concluding" book to 
your Work may I ask when may I be 
favored with it =
105

2843    10,057     I cannot give it you at once 
I do not wish you to copy much until 
you are better you must do but very little 
at a time -

May I ask if you have &c.

2844   10,058   I have not

Can we see Treser this Evening

2845    10,059   did he promise you that he would 
appear this Evening 
I will ask him to appear.

              Invoked Tresev
         He cannot appear tonight 
On which Evening will he appear

10,060   Next Tuesday.
10' past 9. PM.

             ♂︎die 8 Sept. 1857
                     Invoked the C. A.
May I ask if we can see Tresev. this Evening

2846   [10,0]61   He will appear

Of what order or degree is Tresev

2847   [10,0]62   He is a good spirit but not a high one

May I ask how it is that Constantine was 
formerly my Seer's GS. and after apparently 
some changes - Tresev is now her GS.

2848   10,063    I cannot explain it to you 
But this one I believe will not hold 
his office long.
[*106*]

[*2849 10,064*] I understand you 
I acknowledge that it does, I am 
aware that such Spirits may be sent 
but what reliance can be placed upon 
them - or what good can they do - The 
men with whom they communicate are 
the very first to wish to get rid of them 
for if they associate too much with the 
things of earth they may tell into time 
abruptly things that would much 
distant him - that coming in the 
course of events he would be prepared 
to meet - and again we are ever ready 
to associate rather with that which is 
above than beneath us.

[*2850 10,065*] There would be no harm in your 
calling a spirit to give you information 
on any particular thing you might 
wish but I would rather not solicit 
of such a one his appearance to you 
myself. - And in Mr Lea's case I 
think it gives no proof of Lero's rise, 
in the spheres that he is desirous of 
doing so, and I shall be very glad 
when Eltesmo appears to impregnate 
the Seal with his influence. that Mr. 
Lea may be more safe, against the 
intrusion of many who are near enough 
and ready enough to come to him.

I believe also that when the power 
of seeing is fully developed and you 
have arrived at that point of perfection 
in Spiritual Communication when nothing 
further can be gained it should alone
107

be used for the higher purposes of spiritual
instruction --  mortal visions and 
mortal events are the means but someth'g
greater more lasting and beyond are
the end and results.

May I ask if you will favor us with a Vision
this Evening

2851   [10,0]66    I will give you a Vision on another E'g.

Shall we have it next Tuesday

2852   [10,0]67   You Shall

May I use the Evani glass this E'g to see
Capt Benton.

2853   10,068   Yes
Mr Anderson is very desirous of appearing
if you have a short time to spare for him

May I ask if Mahomed Ali will ever fulfill
his promise of giving me the meaning of the
[?] Inscriptions

2854  10,069   I think he will

[May] Will you kindly ask him to do so

2855   10,070   I do not communicate with him
I have seen him with those things in 
his possession  which he copied from
your book.

On what evening w'd he appear if called

2856   10,071   I do not know.
I should be quite willing to tell you
were I able
     I only think he will return at
some future time because I know he
has those plates in his possession
and he could have no reason in keeping
them unless he intended to return to you

On Friday Evening next I expect Mr Dresser will
favor me with a visit may I request you

108

as far as possible to prevent his At Spirit annoying
me again.

2857   10,072   I will
Put all your other Mirrors & Crystals
out of the way on that Evening.
Mr Dresser's At Spirit has caused you
so much annoyance, before -- that it is
advisable to take every precaution ag't
its recurring. --
     Use this Mirror, and tell Mr M
not to bring his -- you had better take
your Japan Crystal away from its place
and put it with all the others you
possess together with the unconsecrated
one that you use at times --  put a
sheet of paper or something between
that and the others so that they do
not touch.  and lock them in a drawer
with this Seal of mine,  you will not
want to use it on that Evening, and let
them so remain until Mr D has left.

May I ask if you have still objections to my
[?] a lodging of F. M.

2858  [10,0]73    I have

Then of course whatever my wish  I w'd not join it

2859  [10,0]74  Why do you wish it

I explained.

2860   10,075   If I had no Reasonable objections I should
desire you to do as you wish, but there
is at the root of those societies so
much that is wrong firmly strengthened
for ages  so much that I entirely

Will you &c.
Now he has shown the stone -- Amber Colored

You promised to enquire what w'd relieve my Seer's
bad health.
[*110*]

[*10,078*] I have enquired but without much success 
but I have discovered that the seed of 
the older [tree] berry is a most excellent 
remedy. for fullness of the chest. 
A decoction of it drank when the 
stomach is empty.

As to the quantity & strength.

[*10,079*] Three ounces of the berries would make 
a pint and that might be divided 
into ten parts. (9 or 10)

Have you any objection to being called.

[*10,080*] I do not mind appearing if I am 
wanted.

On what subject do you best like to give informatn. 

No answer.

Will you favor me with an answer.

[*10,081*] If you desire any thing you think it 
is likely I may be able to give, you 
can call me.

My reason for asking was that some spirits give 
information - concerning their charges health. others as 
[?] - on Astrology - some Metaphysics

[*10,082*] I was not aware that Spirits & mortals 
generally communicated with each other 
on such subjects, what we know is 
generally kept amongst ourselves. 
I am not prepared for such communicatn 
the ways are strange to me. 
Because I am unused to them.

I am always anxious to [?] receive any 
additions to my knowledge of Spiritualism - from 
Friendly Spirits that I believe to be good & helpful 
but I will not press it

[*10,083*] When I say that you are a Stranger
[*111*]

[*10,084*] to me, that I have from my first being 
never communicated by visible means 
with any of your race, you will pardon 
me for appearing unwilling at once to be as 
communicative as others that have known you 
longer. - it is not from unfriendliness or 
any want of respect. - but were you 
spoken to by a stranger of another sphere 
you also would shun them for a while 
and keep yourself reserved.

I returned thanks.

[*10,085*] I thank you.

Tresev left 8 past 9. PM.

10 past 9 PM. C.A Mirror

Called Mr Anderson

He is walking in from the back. he seems to walk 
so heavy (the Spirits glide downwards from the top) 
he looks so dark in the face

[*10,086*] Are you engaged this Evening

Good Evg Mr Anderson. I hope you are well - many 
circumstances have prevented my calling you before

[*10,087*] I hope you are quite well

I explained

[*10,088*] I was just going to ask you how you 
found yourself.

I informed him

[*10,089*] I hope not 
I came this Evening to bid you good bye 
God knows for how long for it seems 
now impossible for the vision of a 
person to appear. who is crossing or who 
is in the other side of the Ocean.

Are you then going to India
112

10,090   I am off Portsmouth now.

I replied and gave him our good wishes for his 
health & advancement

10091   There is no prospect of it not even the honor 
and glory of warfare where we go to now 
but I am glad we are going, glad 
with my heart and soul, and only trust 
that we shall get there - we hear enough 
to show as little mercy to those devils of 
Sepoys as they have shown to their victims 
for the whole army is insatiate against 
them and we look forward to delight 
not as men but as bloodhounds upon 
their prey - our very blood curdles and 
souls sicken as we hear the accounts 
and read the letters that every day 
reaches us -
     It seems strange that Religion 
should be such a hot-bed for bloodshed 
and warfare - but this all comes 
from pork fat. not agreeing with their 
conscientious doctrines

If we intend to hold India - they must of course 
be put down with an Iron hand. but let us 
do it as - believers in Christian doctrines.

10,092    The race must be extinguished before 
they can be put down.

That may be a very "Religious" mode of action & 
certainly an Effectual one - did you ever read 
how our "Christian" troops acted in Spain at 
the sack of Badajoz" -

10,093    They have shown to our people not 
the slightest trace even of humanity 
and if we are at the trouble of going 
all this distance on their account they
113

can expect none from us

You argue like a priest - The Rev'd Mr [?] 
has sent a long letter to the Times urging that we 
shall violate the laws of God unless we take a 
vengeance a thousandfold - now as they have 
destroyed a 1000. we must to satisfy his views 
of a merciful GOD. slay a million # - The guilty 
the Innocent must suffer together

10,094    But how can you pick out the guilty 
and save the innocent

That is the greater reason for us to act up to 
what we profess "Christianity" - & exact justice not 
[revenge] indiscriminate revenge if we take Delhi

10095    [That we] And we shall do so. , and the 
mastery can only be obtained by 
blowing it up - You are not to withstand 
firing into that place because the 
women and children are there 
I should like to get hold of the King 
of Delhi myself.

Doubtless but dont you know    "there is 
doth hedge a King" & if the King is taken 
alive your officers will suddenly find they 
must behave to Kings like men of honor = if 
only the rabble thats to be blown from guns

10096    Oh I think not - he aught escape for 
what the men in high places cared 
but the men in the ranks would aim 
at him before he reached a place of safety 
a stray shot would do for him.

As I shall be so ignorant of your whereabouts 
now I will not call you - but trust to your 
appearing when convenient & agreeable to you

10097    I will. I dont know what this is 
they say makes the difference of an
[*114*] Atmospheric Spirit crossing the water 
do you know. -

I read.

[*10,048*] If I find no difficulty I wd appear to you

Thank you. when Emma & I were at the Crystal 
palace. she made this drawing from memory of 
your friend the Spanish Lady (showing the card)

[*10099*] Not a bad one either 
When you see Mackenzie tell him not 
to call me because if I want to say any 
thing to him I can appear.

I showed him the MS. P de C. was giving me & asked 
if he saw the Seals

[*10,100*] Yes I see them. I wonder what it will be 
when complete - what shall you do with 
it.

I shall much miss your absence, for altho lately 
I have been able to see you so seldom you have 
been our oldest Spirit friend

[*10,101*] You have been as much a Spirit friend 
to me as I have to you.

Yet excepting this Case of the Portrait - I have had no 
proof or your real existence

[*10,102*] I have had no possible proof of your 
existence 
That little Mackenzie has all but 
[?] me out.

But I have given you my Name & address - however 
as I have said before I will not attempt to penetrate 
your [?] - I will most cordially wish you 
success -

[*10,103*] I trust that you may do well during 
my absence - for myself the chance 
is so very slight of ever returning
175
that I eagerly look forward to it even
with hope.
We trust you will, and that we shall "in the
body" have the pleasure of Seeing you and also
your little Son. We used to See in our Earlier
Visions.

10,104 There are delusions in these things
that must have been one of them.
I will go now if I have a Chance
I will appear to you again living or
dead the last perhaps Easier than
the first.
Accept our best wishes &c

10,109         Invoked Eltesmo.
Now the Mirror's covered all over a thick white
Not a mist — Theres pillars come in Each side
& arches at the top. & beyond it appears to
narrow to a hole. like a Tunnell beyond
which it is very light — and pillars all the
way along and a path right up in front
of me. but the bottom of the pillars is
above the Mirror & some steps go up.
     Eltesmo is Coming in front of the

he is just under the first Arch,  the pear
shaped stones are a bluish White very light
blue in the middle   White towards the Edges, & very
bright.
I showed the Seals & requested to know if the
drawing was correct

10,110    It is

I showed the 3 others

10,111    It is

I will write to Mr Lea to come next Friday, as
my seer is too unwell to go to Limehouse
And it is so much easier to Converse by my
Seer.

10,112   You say right it is Easier to Communicate 
through your Seer.  than throug his
for her faculties are blunted
     I would wish you to say to Mr.
Lea for me that I am pained by his
dark and gloomy forebodings — of his
future , and it makes me fear that my
being to him what I am has indirectly
caused him a sorrow and a heaviness
that he knew not of when another was
in my place.
     If I have Spoken to him of death
it has been rather to Remove its sting
than to present it for Ever to his eyes. &
if I have dwelt much upon the hereafter
it has been to place a stepping stone
of faith under his feet. — not to cast a
shadow over this life which to all should
be one of joyousness and hope
     I have not spoken to him
particularly of a premature death the
life of all men is short and uncertain
118
his may be so especially but it may
by his own care and precaution be
extended to the natural period of his
Kind. — Such is in the hands of GOD
and it is a reprising at His all wise &
all merciful government — at the actions
of His Being. to continually brood upon
the Sorrows of death.

I retd thanks & sd I wd call next Tuesday
10,113 I will appear.
As we were unprepared to be Called
this Evening you [will] find us in our

10, 116         The Vision
The humors [reviled?] - now its quite clear , there
audible spots of light flying about like sparks 
a perfect shower. in all directions The [air?] seems 
full of them _  they seem to fill a large space & in
the distance they are so fine it seems like a
mass of fire.
In the middle of the distance theres a
bright red cross. _ it looks solemnous standing
out amongst the bright yellow _ it's a solid cross
about 6 or 8 inches long and one inch thick a 
bright Crimson _ now there are shadows of forms
going backwards and forwards and under
them a large black hole - they are Spirits with wings
but very shadowy they keep round the hole
but do not cross it on the other side of the 
black hole opposite to them there is a clear
black cross lying downwards it looks like
Glass and there such swarms of figures coming
up out of the black hole quite a stream.
They seem to scramble up and lay hold of
this red cross to get up by and as each lays
hold of it it appears to shake backwards & forwards
Each one lays hold & directly it shakes he lets
go and passes on they do not touch the Cross
till they are half up, they are all black as 
though a black veil a mist was over them
and the spirits are standing on the other 
side of the White Cross .
In the first [loss?] there are 4 or 5 just
opposite me they have no wings and are dressed 
in Colors . Some quite black all dark, one is 
in a blue dress one in a brown. fastened round 

[drawing]

a
.
120
in a girdle - the next row behind them are
fairer and got more white about them and
something white about their heads - and in the
next row behind them there's a number of
little curly headed children amongst them. and
behind them there stands two very fair & 
white. their arms bare more statue like and
more spirits behind them with wings & stones
in their hair - white dresses and colored robes
over them. and a cloud round them - above
them there are 3 figures like shadows robes
faces things but only a faint shadow then at
the very top of the Mirror is a round ball of light
and from that comes a ray of light that falls
over the [foot] . black hole at the foot -
     The ray of light is just the size of
the black hole the ray seems redder than 
light on this side theses a kind of wheel
going round. only of light - not something the
Shape of a wheel and the people who come up 
go to the right side of the wheel - the ray does
not reach the people or the black hole.
     Seven omina stands on the other
side of the golden wheel looking through at the
people on this side - and they first instal that
has come up through the black hole he is
looking at and appears speaking [?]
the wheel has seven spokes and at the end of
each is a little cross - seven omina seeing
addressing this person. - now some move to the
first row and appear speaking to these. he
moves his hand to them and points to the person 
the others still keep throwing up this the hole
and all the spirits in Colors seems to answer 
at once as though they were laughing
[*121*]

Now [Som?] turns to the mortal again, now 
he has turned the wheel one spoke further round 
and the person goes in, on this side black 
and come out a thick white mist on the other 
side - when he comes out as a white mist he 
changes again into the shape of a body

Now theres a kind of greyness seems 
to go over them - theres another going through the 
same spoke, the grey mist seems to hang 
like a mist over them, they look down & stand 
as though they were waiting, theres another 
gone through thats 3. and they've all changed 
& got the grey on. - theres another, 4. still 
[Som?] talks to the first row before he turns each 
spoke round - theres another, 5. - and the Spirit 
in the brown robe with a bright face has gone 
out of sight with the 5 all round him -

Now the crowd coming up. thro the 
black hole are opening and theres something 
in white coming up. the middle of the hole. 
it looks like a square board with a heap 
of something on it. and a white cloth 
all over it very large it goes up to the wheel 
and the people keep scrambling up again. 
- It stops this side of the wheel and falls 
down like dust but the shape of it continues 
Every particle has fallen away like dust to 
the bottom - but a mist remains which is going 
thro the wheel and the first row of Spirits opens 
and it goes through them - and at the next row 
it seems to slacken its space now there rises 
like heads above the board[s] like a white cloud 
rising in heads and its now forming into heads 
with hair and curls now the shoulders seem 
rising there are 5 coming up out of it they
122 
they are all rising in prisman shape and 
while drapery—the heads are the most distinct 
and below is only like a cloud, the board 
appears as a cloud now. and all the rows 
fo Spirits have opened to let them through 
when they get up to the last, they are just 
Such figures—the 5 get up round one of 
them and then they all go away 
Seven OM keeps letting the others then’ 
All the while—theres 5 more of them gone away 
with one of the Spirits in Colors—the clean white 
Curves deems as though water was round it 
and the led cross looks like a flame colored 
light all round it—
Now heres another white and closing 
up the hole. larger than the other.—its doing 
just the same as the other except when it 
gets through the wheel it slops close to the 
clean white cross laying down and begins 
to change as soon as it gets over the cross 
and all the rows of Spirits open for them 
its got up to the Shadowy Spirit at the copy 
and one of them is giving up with this first 
row its going—its all gone. 
25 past 9. 
C.A Mirror 
Invoked Seven Omina 
12 past 9. 
Seven omina immediately appeared—I thanked him 
& mentioned as Dr Mackenzie was now present he 
would present his own questions 
123
KRM. I. You have frequently spoken to me of special information
you desired to give me when I came here
which you could not give me through my seer, may I be
favored with it?
10,117 I have wished to hold Closer communion with
You many times .
I have nothing particular at present to
say to you it has been at times when you
have been undecided or in Error that I have
been desirous of addressing You.

KRM. 2. I have always exorcised you, may I ask if I was right
in doing so?
10,118 Continue to do so Every time you do so, and
to Every Spirit that appears until you are
able to see yourself and know each by
his looks. When such is the case a
Sincere invocation is Sufficient to bring
the Spirit you desire and then when he
appears you are able at once to distinguish
them. but when there is the slightest
doubt an exorcism and in Every case
after asking their name request to see
the stone that fastens their Robe and
the letters that are upon them.
[KRM 3]
It is most desirable that you should
be guarded in Every way now that so
You may begin aright for by it much
trouble and Anxiety will be saved hereafter
and after having taken Ever precaution
against Evil — Should such an accident
come to you you can neither be chargeable
or blamed for it

KRM 3 May I ask when my spiritual eyes will be open,
& my sight given to me?
124
10,119 It will be gradually developed after
your birth day.

KRM 4. Will you kindly favor me with some information as
to my spiritual sight and as to how I shall use it.
10,120 Lay down as an unalterable law rules of good
upon these form your Conscience [(?)] and
then use that mediumship only for
such actions such communication and
such information as can be approved of
by that and agrees with the other.
Such a lair of Conscience will tell
You that you may not turn the gift
of a good power to the gaining of wealth.
for that cause is desecrated the Effects
of which can be bought and sold
That as Almighty GOD givEs his
blessing unto all men a free gift without
distinction or choice— So you on the receipt
of such a gift must givE it unto others
as he has givEn it unto you.
Thus the first duty is performed.
Again in giving the benefit of your gift
to others you must so temper it as to
Carry out the plans Your Reason teaches
You to think was the intention of the
donor..— use if only for the purposes
that you believe — They who givE if you
would use it were they in your place
use it with loving kindness + Charity
to men — not with harshness + severity
Do not give it to others without
Mature thought. and careful
Consideration and you may do
125 
harm by a two quick application of 
what would affenand prove a remedy for 
suffering—and again [must] in all 
your intercourse with them be they Spirits 
of the highest order—Maintain calmly 
and resolvedly—reason on its form Throne 
of the Mirror—be not over powered or 
influenced by their assertions other than 
through your intellect and judge them 
by the Certession of Consistency—for 
Consistency is Tenth. 
[Krath] 5 May I ask if you approved of my inducing [you] 
Dr Dixon to make use of a Mirror instead of other modes of 
communication 
10,121 
You did right it is preferable and has a 
more visible Identifying power . 
KM. 6 Have I your permission to invoke my GS to whom 
you succeeded in my Mirror 
10,122 
You have. 
KM. 7 May I ask how Swedenborg persewed his Spiritual 
Visions & whether he really departed from his body at such 
times. 
10,123 
I believe that many of his Theories. More 
from dreams—that the body went 
into a stupor—and then instability 
and after that he saw into the 
Atmosphere—and there beheld his Visions 
& Conversed with Spirits

8 PM   The vision 

10128
Now the Mirror's veiled, it is like the [?]
opal glass. All over the mirror - now its clearing
away at the bottom & the top remains thick --
   at the bottom of the Mirror is a rough [stoned?]
[robe?] and some grass on each side as though it
went thro a field the grass is very brown & withered
and theres some tall trees standing about straight 
trees larger at the bottom than the top and [red?]
leaves except at the top the leave are very brown
& red some of the leaves are round like the
Victoria Regia & turned up the Edge, and theres some  
with long scalloped leaves they are greener & some
trees with no leaves at all the run up to the top
and hang down near the ground with something
at the end theres a great many of these three sorts
& nearly all together
   Theres 7 or 8 little houses -- they have 4
[walls?] and a little round place to go in at and
between the top of the [Mills?] the roof is an
open space making a kind of [window room?]
[*127*]

the roof - theres 12 houses & some more behind 
of which I can see the tops, theres soldiers in them 
they are coming out and a number more coming 
along the road - on the other side opposite the 
houses - horse & foot soldiers - the first lot have dark 
blue caps and a little ball on the front of each 
cap, and some of the soldiers have pieces of red 
hanging down the side of the cap, the foot soldiers 
are in a square [?] a square of soldiers and on 
each side some soldiers singly.

behind the horse soldiers there are some 
more on foot, they have not got the same kind 
of coats on - more of a dress buttoned round them 
and short full skirt not near to the knees. & high 
caps - and at the back of these houses. near the 
trees there are some much larger houses some 
with red roofs, they seem stone colored all these 
soldiers are going towards the houses.

Theres a wall between the Trees and 
the houses it looks like a Town & a great many 
people out round the houses, I think they are 
soldiers & inside & outside the wall all seem 
moving - now theres a good deal of smoke 
they are like an immense moving mass - 
they are fighting & they are coming this way

Theres a man riding about a horseback 
with his hat in his hand on a black horse a 
rather small man with red coat & tall black 
boots he is rather stout & fair - a very curious 
looking man with beard & moustachios very 
light a very square face and low forehead 
I dont think he's an Englishman.

The square of foot soldiers have got up 
to the others thats fighting and they are coming 
backwards and all of them are coming this
The [?] of the mirror still remained white
128

this way, the  square and all, now its stopped
they are all fighting some of them have got white
dresses on - Now the horse soldiers have got up
to them they go to the right of the square of [?]
in the middle. they are tearing about and the smoke
seems coming out -

The Man on horseback has rode round
the front of the horse soldiers and right amongst
the thickest of those thats got white dresses on
those men are not near black. but yet not so
light as the horse soldiers - he rides at such a 
rake. - he is turning round - one hand on the back
of the horse and looking round at them - now
he's stopped his horse under one of the Trees
he has got a horn hanging on to where his sword
is - like a drinking cup very long with a silver
rim round the top. that would hold nearly a
pint he is taking it off the top of the sword
he looks round at those that are fighting with
the horn in his hand - he is quite by himself
he's jumped off his horse & put it on the other
side of the Tree, now he has jumped up again
and galloped away - he is looking back at it
he said something to it before he put it down
I see theres a piece of something [coming out of]
[it] like white papers in the bottom of the cup
round like a penny close against where he
placed the cup theres some water very little
it runs over a large stone and then drops down
over some pebbles & disappears

He is in the middle of them again and
got his hat on - the paper is coming out of
the cup rising up by itself coming up so gently
just as though it was [???ed]. and as that
comes up the cup goes gently over on its side
[*129*]

towards the water - now its on its side, and the water 
runs in the cup and the paper floats on the 
water - Theres a great many men laying on the 
ground where they are fighting - the cups three 
parts full of water and now its standing upright 
now its quite up & the piece of paper has gone 
down the stream out of sight.

The man on horseback's outside again he's 
taking his watch out of the pocket and looking at 
it now theres some one fighting with him close 
up against his horse. he is bending down, now 
his horse has dropped down & he's jumped off 
I cant see him now he's behind the other, it was 
a foot soldier who shot the horse - now I see 
him he's stepped outside again on foot, he 
seems to pant so hard - there he wont let them 
alone but gone back again directly - now he's 
outside again & keeps coming round. he keeps 
close to them, now hes going off towards the 
Water. he doesnt seem to want them to notice 
him. - Sometimes he stops hes got to go 
past the square. thats on foot. the front row is 
mixed with the others - now he is pretty near 
the tree he has taken his cap off. and put his 
hand over his eyes. - he's talking to himself 
now he is stooping down feeling all round 
he keeps his hand over his eyes and feeling 
for the cap which is just before him - now he's 
got it he is still saying something to himself 
now he's drinking some of the water now hes 
stooped down & is feeling about - he's poured 
the rest on the stone the water runs over he's 
shaken the drops out and hangs the cup over 
his sword again - he still keeps his hand 
over his eyes
130

There's a white mist Comes out of the Water
gradually forming into the figure of a spirit 
It is a spirit with black hair long and 
very silky looking and quite straight - a white 
dress on and over that. another white large 
mantle or cloak - He stands on the pebbles and 
the water just covers the feet - now the soldier
has taken his hands away from his Eyes and 
put both his hands behind him be bends his 
head forward looking very intently at the other
and [saying] seeming to speak to him -

The spirit answers him and goes closer to 
him he draws back a little and looks down
upon the ground - one speaks and then the other
Now they both speak at once - the battle has
been going on all the while - but I cannot look 
at both. - they seem almost to quarrel they 
seem to talk so fast.

The man looks at the spirit and then
point to where the others are fighting - the 
Spirit shakes his head. now he has put his 
hand on the man's arm & looks at him so hard 
now he has taken his hand off the soldier's arm
and the soldier has taken his glove off his right
hand and put the hand back upwards
towards the Spirit - the Spirit has put his
hand on the top of it - the man shakes and
turns very pale and the Spirit looks close
into his Eyes the mans holdded [withdrawn] his h[ea]and 
They have taken their hands apart - their 
backs are both this way & their faces towards
where they are fighting - They have got up
close to the others - the man marches along 
as tho' there was no one at the side of him
but he's dreadfully pale. - the other glides
131

along side of him - Now I shall lose them again
No I shant - the Spirit is taller than the rest
and all white he is taller than the man, he
must have risen from the ground now he and the
Man's stopped the Man's turned round & looked
at him, and has actually laid down on the ground
quite deliberately
     The Man's laid down but there's another
seems to have risen up out of him exactly the
same only thinner & shadowy  he's got the
same dress,  the same hair & face & the same
long boots - only not substantial more like a
body cut out of painted glass - the other body's
laying quite still as though dead, the face
quite white.    Now the water spirit has stooped
over the body laying down & pulled the sword
out of its case, and stuck it right into the
body and broke the sword right in two, leaving
part in the body and got the handle in his
hand which he is turning over and examining 
     he appears to have wiped his hand
over a little raised knob in the handle which
has come off and left it smooth, he has put
the handle beside the Man and he and the
Spirit Man are going away together. rising
from the ground and going off and going up
towards the part of the mirror which is still
quite white and as they go up the white goes
down and has covered all the fighting and
the houses & trees.
     Now there's only the two figures going
through the air   they are going through
clouds  they can scarcely be seen they are
as it were in a mist - now its clear blue
above & stars shining  now the light is getting
132

so much stronger it hurts my Eyes - they are
getting a footing on something only the soldier
the others going on without him, and left him
standing he looks very strange standing there
he looks taller than he was and slighter, he has
got a very peculiar countenance, he has blue
Eyes  but they look like some peoples black ones
they are so searching  though only light blue
but such a very wide low forehead. Rather a
wide flat nose, a swarthy fair complexion
beard hair & skin pretty much the same color
     Now he's not walking but gliding gradualy
along as tho he slid and come to a long row
of white arches.  Supported by pillars hes going
through the arches - the arches go round
two sides of a square  the square is white of 
smooth surface and theres an immense number
of spirits and on the other side where there
are no pillars theres a wheel the same as I
saw on ♀︎ die night and a spirit behind it
and 5 or 6 rows of spirits one above another 
the same as I saw then.  Each row differently
dressed it is so very light the soldier folds
his arms & stands there  the furthest away
from the wheel   and the others seem to get
away from him - Theres the Red Cross and the
White Cross with the hole and the people
coming up just as before.  as he stands there
those that pass and repass him seem to avoid
and get away from him - he stands nearest to
me of all & there are great numbers of atmospheric
spirits that are between him & the hole
     Now the Water Spirit has come out of
the Cloud and come towards him - the Water
Spirit has been up to the Wheel - now they are
[drawing]

B
[*133*]

going in amongst the others, they are getting
up towards the wheel - the water spirit speaks
to the spirit on the other side of the wheel and
points to the soldier and the spirit at the wheel
speaks to the first row of spirits by the white
cross and they all answer - he has spoken
to them again and they have answered again
the soldiers spirit has gone round the side
of it. and joined the man - the man changed
as he went through. Now he has on loose brown
robes and something white round his neck
+ round his sleeves - now the mans  brown dress
is changing into blue - and now the wheel +
all the scene is going off sideways. (WB)
and the water spirit + man have come to a
round of steps a round roof supported by pillars
with a little gold cross on the roof the arches
are beautifully carved they are going up the
steps and got under it in the middle the
place looked paved with white marble and
in the middle of that there's something stands
on a pillar - with six sides theres a pillar with
a bead to it and then theres six sides coming
up in a peak and on each of the b sides a 
good thick book and the water spirit seems
to turn them over and walk about them to the
soldier spirit now the water spirits coming
down and leaving the man spirit standing
there. now its going - its gone

                                   C A Mirror
               Invoked the C. A.
10' past 7.        Present Mr N G Dresser & Mr H Lea
Mr Dresser is a member of a Lodge of F. M. and [but]
Mr. Dresser is anxious to obtain your opinions of
that society.  & also the opinion of his G S.

2868   10,129   I am aware that my opinion in that
respect [differs] does not agree with that of
his G S.

May I ask your objection to the society

2869   10,130   I have given you my reasons for desiring
that you should no join the Society

If any &c

2870   10,131   I have not.

18' past 7.                 Invoked Eltesmo

             See.
[?]
135
136
137

5' past 8 Invoked Almondis    

Almondis did not appear but the following came
into the Mirror upon my enquiring why he did not 
appear.

10140
He would be willing to do so in a Crystal
but he does not like a Mirror

Will he then appear in my ES

10142
Yes

If I use my Crystal will Almondis engage that
& promise to prevent MWGD's atmospheric Spirit
from annoying me again

No answer

I repeated the question without answer when the 
Seer said here's the CA coming & said

2871
I am quite aware that it seems uncourteous
to Mr dresser the absence of his Guardian 
Spirit but Almondis is not so high 
or so good as it is desirable that he
should be. -- he cannot stand the test
prepared for him.
   Could he have appeared it would
have proved him to be Equal to his
office. but his desire of doing so by
a lower means and his [st?] this 
way shows him to be of a low Sphere
   I am glad that it has been tried
because it is desirable that he should be
changed

As Mr Dresser can neither see himself nor find a
Seer -- his knowledge of Spiritualism is necessarily
limited -- and in a matter so singular to him
as Guardian Spirits must appear -- he can only 
leave the appointment or change in the hands of 
God

2872
10144
It is better that he should do so
138

NGD. may I attribute to this change in my GS.'s 
condition - the misfortunes that have befallen me 
during the last year or two.

2873 
10,145 
It is during that time he has changed 
I was not aware of it until now, but 
you being as you say unconnected with 
spirits generally and their doctrines you 
can do no other than remain passive 
in this case resting more firmly on the
Almighty alone to do as he thinks best
in all Spiritual matters concerning you
at the same time being determined as far
as man can be to act only as your
reason may teach you to be right, and
so strengthening your own Spirit as to be
enabled to progress alone towards
happiness -- worthy of being looked
upon without a medium between you
and Him.
for if you are so fortified by Christian
principles you cannot be dragged
down by the whole Spirit World combined
and nothing not even the antagonist
of all good can find an entrance to your 
heart.

Assuming that this          of a Guardian Spirit
is connected with my worldly affairs is there
any thing I can do to obviate its effects.

2874
10,146
In the natural course of events such
matters will change.

Will it be proper to pray to God to change this
GS. and appoint one of more benevolent character

2875
10,147
Pray to Him to do as it seemeth to Him
best -- and especially mention that is 
you are under any Evil influence such
[*139*]

may be [?] and that you may be 
guided in a new way.

Whilst Mr Dresser & I were talking upon the subject 
there appeared.

[*2876 10,148*] Whether you be a Spiritualist or not 
there can be nothing in this that the 
most scrupulous conscience can reject
     If you know the true laws of the 
Spirit World and have received them in 
a natural way. You may understand 
more fully its meaning and enter 
further into its spirit - but if you are 
desirous of doing neither, and have 
done nothing towards it you cannot 
object to it -

Mr Dresser has a Sister in Law in India 
from the present disordered state of that country 
he is very anxious to learn if she is safe & well

[*2877 10,147*] Such a question is naturally of interest 
to any one - I shall enquire.

We shall be obliged her name is Albina Greenbrough. 
When shall I receive your answer

[*2878 10,150*] Next Tuesday.

WGD. May I ask if the Rosicrucians ever existed 
as a sect or society

[*2879 10,151*] Yes

I have just been reading that they only had existence 
in the brain of a lutheran Clergyman.

[*2880 10,152*] It has existed for ages and will until 
time is no more because its laws are 
the laws of nature - and they are the 
same from the beginning to the end

Was there any connexion between the Free Masons
& the F.R.C. at any former time.

[*2881 10,153*] Never any connexion between them
[*140*]

one may have arisen from the other 
the two [companion] societies [bear] no 
comparison.

I presume the F.A.C. is the highest society

[*2882*] They are indeed

In the other society there are references made to 
something that has been lost. can you tell me 
what that is 

[*2883 10,155*] The knowledge of that is still kept 
by the Rosicrucians a secret possessed 
by them now.

Does F Masonry exist now in the state that it 
did originally

[*2884 10,156*] It has degenerated. The Rosicrucians 
are intimately connected with spiritualism 
The Spiritualism of nature - not the 
Supernatural or Magic. - Free Masons 
are not.

Do the Brahmins of India know any thing of 
Free Masonry.

[*2885 10,157*] They have their societies, but they are 
not of the same nature.

A very high Mason told me that he could enter 
a temple of Brahmah - when all other Europeans 
would have been excluded.

[*2886 10,158*] Supposing that to be true it does not 
show that their doctrines & his might 
agree.

But it would almost seem from that that they 
have the same ritual.

[*2887 10,159*] Every man could not do it, even if he 
was of the highest order.

Should I gain any sufficient benefit by 
taking higher degrees in Masonry.

[*2888 10,160*] I do not wish to press my Opinions
141

upon you because they cannot be of 
importance from our slight knowledge
of each other there can be none or little
confidence - I have objections to Free Masonry
of any degree.

Do any means exit of joining a R. C. Society

2889   10,161   There's not one in England at present
but we look forward anxiously to the
time when there will be. the pathway
is opening for it. there are minds
now in being that desire something
greater and higher to work with than
the objects around them. that are
desirous only of being above their kind
that they may benefit the race to which they
belong - and of knowing Spiritualism
more than their fellows only so far as
may be consistent with the Divine Laws
that         them the Mystery of Life.

Mr Randolph an American Medium made
some pretensions to a knowledge of RC doctrines
Can you tell me if that was true

2890   10,162   The knowledge he has gained Comes
from spiritual sources, the truth of
it can be ascertained from the quality
of those giving it.

            ♂︎die 23  Sept 1857         C. A. Mirror
                       Invoked the CA
The C A in white with black border.
May I ask an explanation of the vision shown on♂︎die
in this Mirror

[*2891 10,163*] It is an event that has lately taken an 
earthly scene in the East Indian War 
and the Spiritual Scene one of the conseq'ces 
of it.
     It was a native soldier  such has 
really taken place.  A Brahmin who has 
long held Comm'n  with Spirits was desirous 
of dieing easily instead of being killed by 
the enemy, and as he knew that such 
would be his fate  he desired that the 
spirit should make his body have the 
appearance of the rest.
     By a formula such as he used 
death could be procured.

May I ask your view of the future condition of a 
person who thro sudden reverse of fortune commits 
suicide in full possession of his senses

[*2892 10,164*] Such a one is not punished their progress 
is slow very slow to towards happiness 
because they have to lose entirely every 
feeling and every motive which causes 
their death in one world before there is a 
possibility of enjoying the life in the other

It is an antient belief that suicides remained as 
long in the "darkness of Hades" as they would have 
lived on Earth if they had not committed suicide 
is that so

[*2893 10,165*] No not in all cases - That act combined 
former sin would keep a person confined 
there for that time but not the act alone.
[*143*]

Will you kindly inform me how it can possibly 
occur that spirits who are "good & truthful" once can 
become "lower" & lose their Estate. as Lero. Almonder 
& variosu others I have known - Mortals surrounded 
by the temptations of the flesh may easily fall, but 
how spiritual intelligences do so is to me inconceivable

[*2894 10,166*] It [was] is more difficult for them to remain 
good than it is for man. until they reach 
the 4th sphere they are surrounded by 
Temptations - and the yielding to one alters 
the nature of their whole being - for Spirit 
being but a body of mind when that body 
yearns (?) to what is beneath it it attaches 
itself to it - because to desire, is to be - 
different from man if he desired most 
fervently to be in a distant place and 
yet know to be there would do him harm 
he could set down & say I will not go 
and however much his feelings might suffer 
his body would be immovable - but 
when a spirit says I want to be there - 
he is gone -

Man made up of two natures 
one having control over the other and 
each having power keeps his equilibrium 
spirit with its one nature [wavers?] not 
but rises or falls with conflict without 
contention - It is good, or it is not.

Whilst this change is going 
on in another spirit we individually 
do not know of it - I have not thought 
much of Almondio because when the 
atmospheric spirit of Mr Dresser appeared 
so often to you [?] he did not use 
his influence to prevent it, but when
[*144*]

on friday Evening he refused to appear in 
the Mirror because it was too much guarded 
my opinion was confirmed

I am glad that it was thus 
decided because it leaves no doubt of 
his degradation - yet sorry that it shd. 
have so happened to Mr Dresser.

Mr D has lost 2 or 3 children in the last 2 years 
but not I presume from any influence of Almondio

[*2895 10,167*] it could not cause the death of the children 
of course not. but Guardian Spirits have 
influence in some degree over their charge 
I do not know how it may be exercised 
by those who were in his state

As Mr Dresser has not been able to cross the 
Threshold of Spiritualism - he must necessarily feel 
unwilling to take any steps to remove his GS.

[*2896 101168*] If he has not sufficient interest in 
Spiritualism as to take active steps 
himself towards removing Almondio 
and substituting another in his place 
he can do nothing but remain as he is 
determining to be as upright as man may 
be and so be worthy of the notice of 
one, who can direct without a Medium

I have a MS. which formerly belonged to Dr Libly 
& for which he stated he refused 300 Guineas 
It contains amongst other things a book of 
"The secret figures of the Rosicrucians" could you 
name a Spirit who would be willing to appear 
and explain their meaning

[*2897 10,169*] Let me look at them first and I will 
tell you.

Can you give me any infn. as to the society

[*2898 10,170*] There [are] is no branch of the Society
[*145*]

in England, there are several in Europe 
one in Russia, one in Spain, and a few 
members I believe in Belgium.

Dr [Leground?] [Baction?] - a German [alchemist?] who 
after travelling round the world died very poor in 
White Chapel some 40 years since - processed to have 
been admitted into the F.R.C. and I have his 
Autograph Copy with the seal of Count Chajal attached

[*2899*] I am aware of it

May I read it to you

[*2900*] Yes.

I read it & asked if I had made myself understood

[*2901 10,174*] You have but the man who wrote that 
was not really a member, he knew a little 
about it but there are mistakes in it that 
show clearly he never could have passed 
their examination - doubtless he had the 
ambition of doing so - knew of their assembly 
and spoke with them upon it - but right 
as he is in speaking of them as a body 
of men who profane not the sign of the 
Cross under whose shadow they work 
their wonders. he makes an entirely false 
step by beginning with the taking of an 
oath.

They very first address of their President 
to him about to be initiated explains the 
Nature of an oath. and their objections 
to it.

And as the whole of their knowledge 
is not communicated by mouth but learnt 
by the student gradually they tell him 
that as he progresses a power more 
binding than an oath shall keep him 
separate from other men. and his
[*146*]

knowledge secretly confined [to] within himself 
and if he is unable to answer rightly 
the questions they propose to him he 
cannot be received at all.

You are aware the Rosicrucians 
communicate with spirits

Yes and I am slowly progressing with the RC. MS 
given to me by the Spanish Monk who was 
burned in 1694. -

[*2902 10,175*] But they never under any circumstances 
practised Magic

Will you define the difference between Spirit raising 
& Magic.

[*2903 10,176*] Magic is divination by any means 
except the asking by divine favor.

When you make invocations & formulas 
for any purpose of exercising power 
- seeing marvellous things - making 
appearance to others. doing ought 
for unnatural means - you use Magic 

But when you do nothing save 
by the power of GOD, or by the law of 
nature - you are not magic but you 
work with Spiritualism

Will Eram favor me with a Vision of Capt. Barton 
this Evening.

[*2904 10,177*] I do not know if he will this Evening 
I asked him to do so but you were 
unable to inspect.

If Eram cannot show [us] tonight the vision will 
he pleas to inform us.

[*2905*] He will

If any &c.

[*2906*] I have not this Evening

CA left
[*147*]

9h.20 PM Eram Glass

Invoked Eram to show a Vision of 
Capt R F Barton

[*10,100*] he cannot.

When may I hope for one

[*10.101*] Friday

The letters came in the Eram Glass which is quite 
dark. in large white letters.

25' past 9.

[?]29 Sept 1857. CAM

Invoked the CA

8.15 PM. White on black borders &c.

Mr Lea has been told that when he cannot invoke 
he ought to mention the circumstance to the spirit 
of the mirror is that necessary.

[*10,182 2907*] It is as well to do so to others but [not] 
it is quite unnecessary in the case of a 
Guardian Spirit

I will now with your permission show you the MS. 
of Rosicrucian figures for your explanation 
I showed the CA Plate

[*10,183 2908*] The 6 sided one is a seal which they 
use but it is not finished - the others are 
spurious

May I ask the meaning of the seal & characters. 
to me they appear to represent [?] [?] & [?] the 3 
principles of the Philosophic Work

[*2909 10184*] It is so but there are two bows at the 
side containing Emblems of what was 
supposed to be the combining properties
148
May I ask what these figures Sig'y. at the bottom

2910
10185  I do not know

2911
10.186  This as well as the others excepting the one
I have Spoken of are Copied from another work
and are not really symbols of the Rosi Cross

2912
10.187  Two of these belong to them — The two centre
ones are the symbols of their mode of
sympathetic [cause?].

2913
10.188  No it is but an assumption   they have not
those several Branches of their Knowledge
blended together.

2914
10,189
It is not right but it is evident the party
[Copying] making those plates had Connect'n.
with the Society when they were dated
for at that time the transmutation of
Metals was not known to be a fallacy

2915
10.190  That is Correct
The Mystery is the dealing with Spirits
that drawing is very badly done, and you
could scarcely imagine it to be Copy of the
original where the two Powers of good &
Evil are represented as Yellow & white
flame.

Which represents the good

2916
10,191  The white

2917
10 192  But the other is most like the Original

2918
10,193  I am not
149

2919 
10,194  It does not belong to them.

I thank you  the [Mp?] I have showed you belonged to
Dr Ebenezer Sibley who said he had refused 300 Guineas 
for it.  I need not say how much beyond its value

2920  
10,195 If the 4 plates were taken from it  it w'd
be worthless.

As both my Seer & I are very unwell this Evening I
will not trespass upon your any further this Evening
as I found my head becoming confused.

2921
10,196  It is not [right?] that you should overtax the
mind.  if you have no other questions I 
will leave
And if you desire a Vision   I will show
it you but at the same time, you are
aware that a Vision is a greater tax upon
Spiritual sight than a single vision
   I only mention this not because I
am unwilling to give it, but because
you said you would not keep me longer
on acc of your Seers health.

Next Tuesday is the day appointed by [Ellesmo?] to
give Mr Lea the promised work on Spiritualism -  if 
I call you will you kindly appear.

2922
[10]197  I will but you will see me next Tuesday

If we are at [?] house will you then appear in the E Mirror

2923
10198  Yes
If any

2924
10,199   I have nothing more this Evening
Except that if you like a Vision I will
show it and also should circumstances
prevent your using Mr Leas Mirror at
[?],  [Eltesmo?] has my sanction
to give his discourse in this

[*2925 10,200*] I have appeared quickly that you might 
have the more time to communicate with 
Eltesmo. I will not stay long this Evg 
Next Tuesday I can say to you what 
I should otherwise have done this Evg.

If any

[*2926 10,201*] I have nothing to say. Eltesmo will appr

[*10,203*] Eltesmo delivered a very beautiful address 
to Mr Lea. - On Christian doctrine very 
closely approximating to the tenor of the 
CA's Metaphysical Work.

C.A Mirror
8 PM
Invoked the C.A.
The CA appeared in white with black border.
To day is the Anniversary of my birth and it is with
great pleasure I have to Call you this Evening being
our usual Spirit night — that I may thank you
for all past favors. &c
2928
10,204 I must tell over again, my oft repeated
wish for your benefit & advancement
in happiness both spiritual & temporal
That on the one hand you may
live many years to be loved & respected
as a man and on the other that there
may be a preparation (in) the place of
Safety and rest well fitted with every
blessing of Grace to receivE the immortal
occupant . And that the returne of
the to day., of Every succeeding Year
causes me to think of the long course
of uninterrupted Communion we have held
and shows to me that an intercourse
grounded on a mental basis and
calling into Being Only the faculties
of the mind exists longer and keeps
it strength Entire and its interest,
unsubdued when spiritual Communion
only upheld by Material demonstration
and manifestation to the senses is
Consumed by its own power and falls
with a premature grave.
May our union Continue
152

As it has been becoming as it progresses
through time of a higher nature,
causing us with one effort to look with
a steady gaze upon the things above us
and so learn as to contemplate them
in their true simplicity - Yet infinite grandeur
we may establish such faith in the
goodness + mercy of divine Providence
as to make us both better and holier
than we are with more knowledge +
with more charity

I retd. thanks.
I was in last Tuesday Evg much gratified with
the discourse Eltesmo favored us with, the more
so as it in a great measure coincided with the
doctrine you have obliged me with so often.

2929
10.205
There cannot be much difference of
opinion between any of us, because 
the truth of the doctrines is a fact
that we all know, not a thing of
doubt - that may be - that is very
reasonable to be believed in, but that
the certainty is only of Faith. for we
have proof before us of the truth of
our teachings, and we cannot deny it.

On the Evg (     ) Mr Dresser was here you
very kindly promised to enquire of his sister in
law Mrs. Albina Greenough was alive & well as
her being in India at this period naturally gives
rise to much solitude

2930
10,206
I did enquire and I find she is alive
for she has not been received with the
many that have come into the spheres
from any of the places where so many
have died I have not seen her neither
The [Malulov?] Legacy - see also Vol. 13. p 50. 57,
No. 10429  to  10433
and [illegible] from a newspaper Aug 9/64 Aug 11/64
and Dec 7/64
153
have they — but she is not dead 

(1/2 past 9 13 Oct)

I mentioned the particulars of the portion of a murdered
person's body being found on Waterloo Bridge pier
which had caused so much excitement to [b??ned]
that it appeared to us easy for the CA to learn 
from the at S. of the Murded person his name &c

I was made aware of this circumstance 
by the spirits of the Atmosphere, it has 
created as much or more commotion there
2931    than in the neighborhood were it happened
I know no more than you do except
what I have heard from them, the
corpse is amongst them — the destroyers 
of its life will be discovered
   It is a most painful most sorrowful
thing to think that such a deed should
be committed where civilization & religion
[is] has its centre, and that such & the
like of them should increase instead of
diminish as that progresses.

Surely there must be some great
fault in the laws both of Government &
Religion, that such things can be.

If you wish to discover more of this
Individual case — The Spirit of the Man
himself will be most willing to appear.

You must feel sure that such scenes
of revolting crime and soul destroying sin
drive us from their presence and that
we are entirely banished from the Being
& presence of those who take part in them

That we flee away and hid our heads
[*154*]

rather than witness what we cannot 
prevent. full well knowing that if they 
have darkness to triumph over the living 
as to make them as Evil as themselves 
He [is] who is more powerful than they 
shall overrule their plans. destroy 
their machinations and bring to light 
their hidden and secret Mystery.

And even then we hope His 
Mercy will be greater than His Justice 
for the penalty of his greatest punishment 
in immortality is too great for even the 
blackest crime mortality can commit.

Not being able to see myself. - I have no right 
or wish to put my Seer in her present state of 
health. to the pain of seeing - the A.S. of a mortal 
who appears to have died under such painful 
circumstances - I was in hopes he could have 
the replies to our questions - without seeing the 
deceased person.

[*2932 10,208*] The answers would not come from 
him, unless you know his G.S. they 
could not be relied on, some say that 
he has an Evil Attendant. others that 
he had forfeited the offices of a Good Spirit 
by his own actions, and was without one 
at all.

As I do not know in what state. the deceased wd. 
appear I cannot allow my Seer to see him at 
a risk = but you are aware that [Cornuet?] the Frenchn 
who in Brittany killed in a duel appeared to us 
uncalled in our Crystal

[*2933 10,209*] The Man I have no doubt would 
present a peculiar appearance for I 
believe I have before told you that
[*155*]
persons leaving the earth suddenly under
shocking circumstances with their senses
about them retain the same feelings
and the same character in every respect
in the atmosphere until they are purified
by means that are applied around them

       If this man be innocent of any
great offenses then will that purification
the more readily take place from his
sudden end caused by another. And
then in a very short time he will assume
the appearance of those who rest peacefully

but if his name was known that would be a great
clue to the [?]

[*2934 10,210*] Let it be until next Tuesday and I
will ascertain if he is in apt state
to appear and wiling -- and if between
this and then the body is not identified
you can call him

I thank you

May I ask if at some convenient time you could
show us a vision of the progress of the human
soul from death through the spheres.

[*2935 10,211*] I can do so.

Can we some evening have a vision of the passing
a degree in a Freemason's Lodge

[*2936 10,212*] You could see such a vision as that in 
the Evani Glass after it happened but
not at the time it was happening 

Could we also have a vision of a making of a
T.R.C. -- with the language in English instead
of Hebrew as our former visions

[*2937 10,213*] There is no objection to it.

[*156*]

Dr Mackenzie has been informed that Mr Anderson 
will most probably be killed in India. - do you 
consider that will be the case.

[*2938 10,214*] I do not know for a certainty - I do not 
think it likely for 2 or 3 reasons

I do not like to call him as he is now at Sea. 
but perhaps you will kindly inform me when he is 
willing to appear

[*2939 10,215*] I will - I think by the time he gets 
there the rebellion will be nearly subdued

As to my Journey to [?]

[*2940 10,216*] It will be well for you to see him but do 
not have any thing to do. with those 
with whom he is surrounded.

If any &c

[*2941 10,217*] I have nothing more to say.

20' past 9 PM.

[?]die 20 October 1857 CAM

8 PM Invoked the C.A.

As to the "Waterloo Mystery" & if the CA had made any 
Enquiries

[*2942 10,218*] I have enquired about it in the atmosphere 
the Spirit belonging to the body on Earth is 
now there in its worst state, they say that 
its appearance is very repulsive at present, 
that after next Friday it will be more at rest 
and will then begin to [advance] assume 
the form of a person having died naturally

I do not know whether it was a 
man or a woman altho' I said he on 
last Tuesday Evening, the distinction is 
in the body not in the spirit and having 
left that both will be alike
[*157*]

Can we have when convenient to you a vision of the 
passage of the human spirit from life thro death 
to the spheres

[*2943*] You can any evening you like

As I am not prepared this evening with any questions 
may I request a vision at your pleasure that will 
interest and instruct us

[*2944 10220*] I will then show you the one of the passage 
upwards of the human spirit this evening 
and if you cannot finish with it you 
must see the conclusion next Tuesday.

You must first know that when you see 
the spirit enter "the place" you do not look 
upon all the objects [?] as they 
surround him only circumstances that are 
connected with himself are symbolized

I returned thanks

If any &c

[*2945 10221*] I have not

The Vision

Now the mirror's veiled theres something 
coming in the middle, a tall man in armor 
steel boots up to the knees a steel case for the body 
like a jacket with stripes across of steel steel 
gloves up to the elbow and a helmet, and the 
point turned up I can see the face the throat 
is in armour, the middle of the hands are leather 
he is a tall man - his hands are crossed & a 
spear in one hand resting on the ground the 
spear peaked with a blade on each side

Now theres some reading underneath on a little piece
of paper.   it is.

10,223
" " Man perfect - secure in the [posses] strength of

"  The Spirit of GoD [confined?] in the sinful yet

very pretty, he's gone in - now the front door's
opened, theres rushes laid quite straight and
done in and about at the sides  with red like a
cord. - as the door opened the front of the house
has come this way  so that I see inside.

   The middle of the room has a square rush
matting with pink round the border  and before
the fire a beautiful leopard skin  not squared
or trimmed - theres a high stone chimney piece and
fireplace, the fire is on the ground  and a lamp
comes down from the ceiling,  the ceiling is wood
wooden beams across, oak color, & where the rafters
end they rest on curious carved heads -- the walls
are white  at the side of the fireplace  theres an
oval recess   and a stool on the ground near it  and
a cross against the wall in the recess, its a wooden
cross with some silver nails about it.  outside
the recess theres two candlesticks  one on each side
theres something burning in them but not candles
it looks like a bunch of cotton, lit at the top. --
Theres a little skin & [eat] outside  the seat at the foot of
the cross  a very beautiful skin,  I dont think its a
stool., ah a little low table.  theres something standing
on it,  its a silver goblet with a figures [?] on
the outside  and a silver plate  the plate's got a
great many deep scratches or cuts on it -- /q'y IHS/
Theres some high backed chairs -- rush bottoms &
some stools with cushions on them.  and a long
table in the middle,  and theres a stand with
a book open upon it  the book has wooden binding
[illustration of a book on a tall stand]
and very black print  and theres some
pictures on canvass round the wall, but no
frames -- with figures as large as life but
the buildings in them are very small in



[*160*]

proportion to the size of the people 
In one picture theres men fighting in chain 
armour over their faces and bodies and 
theres a lot of buildings at the side of them 
which dont come up to their necks. 
the men are beautifuly done, theres the 
head of a horse against them -

In the other picture theres a little boy 
with wings quite pink all over and a 
large trumpet in his mouth. he's so fat 
and has such a great head and little 
wings and his cheeks blown out so & the 
soles of his feet turned up and [?] 
hair curly all over. and underneath 
him a lot of people all huddled up 
together some holding up their arms 
some tumbling down & some laying down 
on their faces they are painted beautifuly 
such bright colors & their faces so perfect 
and distinct and behind them looks 
like the end of a Church and Church window 
and round it a Churchyard and people 
all in white coming up out of their graves 
long figures like smoke. - and beyond 
the boy theres very faintly done a white [?] 
with a canopy and angels with wings but 
I can scarcely see them. - 

The other picture is sideways & I can't see 
what is on it -

The soldier is here he has taken off 
his armor & he is sitting down on one of 
the stools - with his armor on - a [?] at the 
side of him he looks at his thumb wch 
he keeps on holding up. & looking at it
161
And then he puts his right hand on his left
side now he's going to get up he seems as if
he could hardly walk he puts his hand on the
back of a Chair and Stops he straightens himself
up and looks at the door Now he has movEd the
Chair against the Table and sits down on it just
under the lamp theres some paper Ink bottle
and pens on the table hes pulled them towards
him — he writes so slow and Curious & so large
he's written one page its large paper and he writes
large about seven lines on a page the letters are as
big as printing he sits facing me and I cant
Read it bottom upwards hes got on buff clothes
with stockings up to the knees and a round
buff jacket his breeches are very full and light
at the knee . and a strap up the sides Jacket open
in front and a shirt in a band and one button at the
Thrat and then all full like a full fronted night
Gown. but very nice and white hes part his hand
into a pocket in his jacket & brought out a bag
theres gold in the bag — Some gold and some
Stones , Some diamond Ornaments & Some rough
stones he's counting them & put them on the paper
the gold in little heaps & the Stones at the Side
Now hes packing them up very Careful & folding
the Ends . Now hes put his hands in his pocket
again & brought out a great piece of White wax
and a Seal — theres a hand grasping a stick & 
a little piece round with a motto underneath
     he is Standing up by the lamp and holding
     the parcel under the lamp & holding
     the wax at the Side & letting it drop on it
     he's made a Seal & put his seal on , now hes
     making one at the middle & one at the 
     other End
162

Now hes directing it he's laid it down
on the Table and laid his head down upon it. face
downwards - now he's lifted his head up again
put his hand across his forehead and got up out
of the chair, and walking very slow. It seems painful
for him to walk to the place where the Cross is.
Now he kneels on the shin at the foot of the table
and puts his arms out right across the table +
looks upwards more as though he was speaking
than praying - he looks excited - now he's reacted
put her across. and put his hand on the silver
nails on the cross and with the other hand he
has taken up the silver Goblet. and drank
out of it. Now he's put down the Cup, and let
go the Cross, he sinks down gradually all of a
heap. his head falls down. his face looks
white - 
Now there's a piece of Paper come with reading on
it.

8 PM Invoked the C.A.

May I ask if you have obtained any information 
relating to the remains found on Waterloo Bridge

[*2946 10,226*] I have not sought any information since 
last Tuesday - but he would appear to you 
and his appearance would not be very 
unpleasant.

If I could see these Spiritual Visions I wd most willingly 
call him, but I do not feel justified in asking my 
Seer to do so. as it might prejudice her health. 
Cannot I obtain the infn I wish without his appearing

[*2947 10227*] You can from the Spirits that are around 
him and know of him.

I thank you. for the reason mentd. I must decline 
Still I imagined I might gain the reqd informatn 
in this mirror & consequently under your influence 
besides the Spirits around him may be evil and 
become troublesome to me.

[*2948 10,228*] Unless I have authority I cannot mix 
myself up with the affairs of another 
Sphere - it would do no good and I have 
no desire for it.

The Spirits that are near to him are 
not bad Spirits, and supposing they were 
to give you information. I should not like 
you to mix yourself up with the authorities 
in London who are seeking for the Murderer 
you could not tell them or if you did 
they would not believe by what means you 
received it.

I wd write anonymously & giving them the clue leave 
them to act upon it

[*2949 10,229*] All I can say is that you have my 
permission either to see the man or the

May I ask for the extension of my Spiritual Knowledge.
Why—in the Course of our [Com?n]. on the Subject of the
Indian War — You did not inform me that [?] was
[fa??en]—I ask this question as one very likely to be
placed before me by — non believers in Spiritualism.
2950
I cannot well explain to you the limits
of my Knowledge—
-
10,230
I do not roam over the earth and
Actually visit the Seat of [??tion] of any
particular Circumstance—neither do I dwell
in the Atmosphere and see them recorded
I know that about the time You speak,
of great slaughter, had taken place this
the fighting of the peoples and I mourned
for it — but I did not know on whose
side was the Victory or that the City had
fallen, or who were [?] + who had
Escaped . I only knew so far of it as [?]was
Connected with me Spiritually.
I make no pretension to be intimately
Acquainted with the things of earth. my
Nature will not admit of it , I havE
no object, no desire, no will to be amongst
them my Attention is turned towards &
my thoughts centered on other objects in
another Sphere.
While the Conflict & the warfare is
going on I wish to be at res. and only
so far as is my duty am I [?]
with it or interfere =
If I desire Knowledge to Effect a
purpose. — a [?] purpose— I must
[g???] it from others. I must seek from
what I believe to be the best Authority
Spirit - Ranks
             Orders
             Societies
             Bands.
165

Any information I want on any particular
subject.

I thank you.  I hope you are not hurt at my having
proposed the question.

2951   10,231   I am not.
It is one that naturally arises to the mind
of many who believe that spirits have
unlimited power - but amongst all
our ranks, and orders, and societies, and
bands. it is necessary that a strict
law., a limitation should be kept for each
for where our knowledge indiscriminate 
our power of penetration unlimited
confusion and uproar would prevail
our natures would be changed and we
should not be as we are -

On Saturday last I saw Dr Chambers for the first
time & obtained his advice.

2952   10,232   I trust you will find benefit from his
peculiar mode of treatment - but I placed
so much dependance upon Dr Elliotson
that since he failed I believe medical
skill will be unavailing.

Can we be favored with the vision this Evening

2953   10,233   You cannot see the continuation of the
Vision this Evening - if Friday is convenient 
you can do so then.

My seer's health prevents my using my mirror
so often as I could wish -  & I have even written to
Dr Mackenzie to postpone his visit as he had wished
to communicate with Seven-O-Mina.

2954   10,234    If you wished him to appear Sevenomina
would do so. and it would be convenient
for me that you should see the vision on
that evening but it can be postponed the
166
delay of a short time is of no consequence
to either of us
Can we see it next Tuesday
My  reason for wishing to show it on Friday
next is I do not like an interruption making
plan any oftener than can be avoided
2955 On Tuesday as it is like before you begin
looking at it. i thought that on Friday 
10235 you could begin earlier and conclude it
but if that is not convenient You can 
say all that you have to say to me. this
Evening instead of next Tuesday and
then begin with that first — although
I like to appear on Tuesdays.

We will then see it on Friday —  is it necessary
for [you] me to call you first

2956 It will be sufficient for you to ask for
10,236 the Visions

I have just received from the binder the 3rd Volume
of your [?] physical Philosophy I need not say
how pleased I shall be to receive your point
as I hope to publish it I am in America. 

A favorable time for publishing has not
yet arrived
2957  I did not give it for the intention of it
being published at [first] least now. I gave
it to you simply as an exposition of my
[?spied] and as a Beacon for your faith.

May I remark that in a former response I [??e] for
3 years since you promised that I should [??ise]
a poem in the mirror — Now as I have not
the slightest power of versification I indeed do not
like poetry in general — it would interest me &
my friends much to peruse a poem named by
these means. 
167
2958
10,238
such a thing could be it must come from
the Spirit of a deceased mortal who was
a poet on Earth., I am aware that there
has been verses full of meaning givEn
through the Mediumship of writing or
Speaking and I also know of much
unmeaning Senseless rubbish givEn to men
themselves Educated & Practical unworthy
of the lowest place from which it could
Emanate.
TherE read 3 volumes of Mr Harris the Spirit mediums
poetry much of which is indeed deeply interesting
and I have also read Garth Wilkinsons poEms by
intuition Which mostly appears to me absurd
doggerell_ I do not know Mr Harris — by Mr Wilkinson
is a Gentleman Eminent for his Attainments the
Author of a life of Swedenborg + translator of Several
of his Works.
2959
10,239
It all comes from deceased Mortals
Poetry is itself an Poetry itself is but an Attribute of Fancy—
This Response came So fast I got confused & requested
it to be repeated.
2950
10,240
It all comes from deceased mortals
Poetry itself is but an Attribute of Fancy
of imagination of the ideal, and that
fancy cannot be exerted Where the real
Can be grasped . so that [practical?]
is the Consequence of an imaginative mind
being Confined in the limitation of the body
When the Spirit bursts its imprisonment
and dwells in the visionary and has
for its world a brighter place and more
beautiful & perfect Connections than the
most vivid thought can ConceivE or act
[???hay] — All that the spirit givEs
168
is in connection with what he has been not with
what he is — his poetry then belongs to the past
is but recollections of his imagination[s] he
does not make it then and givE it to you
but he conjures up bygone fancies & similies
and vague Shadows and givEs them to you as
they then existed only in his mind .
Then I presume the Poems in Mr Harris's volumes are
not then really descriptions of Spirit Lands. but merely
—
2961
10,241
As a conception , an earthly conception of
them — Call the Spirit of Byron and he
would speak with the same Eloquence on
his favorite subjects —LovE Romance —
Shakespeare would be still Theatrical
Milton Sublime — but not with his present
Knowledge
May I ask of Byron would appear + favor me
with a poem.
2962
10,242
Yes he is more likely to appear than the
one I last mentioned Milton .
I am certain that he would do so because
he is not very far on in the Spheres.
He was a Man of worldliness & pride &
knowing Christianity he did not follow its
precepts he was uncharitable + his writing
was never so Eloquent as when turned
bitterly against another man. — he wrote
beautifully but not well.
But of the incomparable Milton
it may be justly said he had a foretaste
of Heaven upon Earth. for being excluded
from all Earthly objects his lofty & Soaring
Mind penetrated with its reason the
Spheres of the blest.

reverence to the divinity, and shows out in 
all its darkness the Sin of the destroyer 
he is gone to the home he dreamed of 
the gates of his paradise are open to receive 
firm and his attendant Angels rejoice in 
he presence—No mortal Ever had the Spiritual 
body of greater Similarity to those of the

Then I said that the writer of that book

To infer under the influence of exterior Spirit

very worldly and seeking for profit that he 
could not be receive in the faith he pretends 
to adhere to, that it is not to uphold that

he publishes work but to make a

of the Vision 
fim, 162 
10,257 
Now theres the Same house come, all the Seer to roamed the house are quite clear, but there 
is a vapor Surrounding the house as tho’ it came out of it—She cat is still asleep in the window 
there is a figure very faint in outline coming out 
at the top. of the house the bottom past where the 
feet should be is a thick black cloud but the 
upper part the shoulders has a white dress & mantle 
With wings of a greenish feathery look, a large 
figure a Mean looking face. Sport black hair
171
dark Eyes , something round the waist , one end
of it is a serpents head the mouth open & showing
its teeth. and what would be the tail of the
Serpent is a sharp steel point like a dagger. and
some distance up the tail is a piece of Steel across
like a handle , the head looks as though it was
going to swallow the dagger. and the point of the
dagger and the middle of the [p] mouth just comes
against a stone with two letters  flame colored letters
in an amber Stone  the black mantle is gathered
up over the arms.  and up to the serpent Comes the
Cloud — theres  A.D. on the Stone.
     Beyond the house where it is clear there's a
round green plot of glass. with trees round there
sides and Cottages amongst the Trees. in the
Middle theres a May pole and people dancing
Round it ,   then comes boys and girls . and Some
that look like Sweeps with their faces blacked
and one of them has Something he keeps putting
to his mouth.  theres a great number of people
All round looking at them,  the women have
Short petticoats and white caps and leathern things
on their legs as tho their shoes & stockings were all
in one Some have got drinking vessels and one
drinking out of them  there are Chairs set out &
some persons setting down a good many have
flowers stuck about them., and some of the
girls have flowers in their hair. and Some have
peaked Caps. on. , theres little stalls with white
cloths. and things to sell and theres a horse &
cart with the back let down and a little ladder
at the back and two men talking ones a Clown
an the other rested in black , the clown is
tumbling & playing off pranks — he is drinking
something out of a bottle, theres lots of people
172
who are Standing round looking at him ; and
hearing all he's got to say — its not a  Cart its a 
long waggon and a table and Chair , theres velvet
& fringe on the waggon faded but mighty fine
theres two miserably drawn pictures inside the
front of the Cart, ones a picture of a very old
woman bent double with a stick, and the others
a very young woman with her hair sticking up
all over and laughing — and the Clown imitates
the pictures first the old woman and then dances
about like the young one.
     Now theres a girl come dressed in very
bright colors something like a patchwork dress
with buff colored leggings and a little white
paper hat. with pink ribbons & flowers inside
and out — a remarkably pretty healthy looking
face  she seems so merry — she's been dancing
round the pole and now she's stopped to look
at the Clown.  and every now and then she 
laughs so heartily at his tricks — at her side 
theres a very countryfied looking boy, she
makes game of the boy and pushes him up
towards the Clown. the boy stares so — now she's
given the boy a little piece of Silver money &
sent him up to the Cart, the boy's got a piece
of Something black put on a piece of white
paper like jam — he's gone to the girl again

     The Spirit still keeps Coming up out of
the house and at its side theres like a very
thin[g] curling smoke  or thick mist all in a
little space not bigger  than a finger it goes up
Spirally altho straight ,  it keeps at the side
of the A D.  the A D rises straght up with this
at its side — now that's gradually taking a form
173
It is turning into the man that died & not in a [m??r.]
but int eh clothes he died in — something like a long waist[?].
or jacket without a waistcoat under it. and buff
breeches & leggings — Just abovE the lops of the Tues
houses & people dancing there s a line — looks almost
like a sheet of glass dividing the miror in two the
top part is much cleaer altho theres Clouds above
its more like two different atmospheres.
the atmosphere underneath appears so
thick to what that is abovE. the two ats. do not at all
mix — the Soldier & the Spirit have got up nearly to
the line — now they have quite the man goes through
it the part of him taht is through is clearer than
that [abovE.] beneath now he is quite thro he is
all ovEr Clearer — he looks very sorrowful the Spirit
has not gone through he keeps underneath the lure
he is passing along horizontally floating along
with his back towards the line — hes going
Straight to all the people on the green and keeps
hovering about over then leads now hes becoming
upright and is coming down to the ground he
keeps about a mans height from the ground and
as he goes amongst them he seems to avoid them
and keeps as far away from them as he can
the people do not see him now hes going towards
the girl with the boy — She's talking to the Clown
She laughs and the boy laughs , the [S] is close to
the girls back now , he movEs Away and then goes
Close to her again — and when the [?] got close to
her the girl turned her head over her shoulder. ^
then turned towards the boy and laughed but very
feignedly — Now she has looked round again — she
does not laugh now. the boy laughs at her and looks
as tho he had asked why. She turned round —
Now the AD had [t????ed] her she is
174
turned very pale and I can see her shudder as
though cold she started and then trembled
now the [AD] has [?] bent hushed down
folded up the Mantle over his face. and gone up
quite fast hes gone nearly out of sight — hes quite
gone.   Now the boy speaks to tehgirl and they
are going towards the dancing the boy looks about
10 years old a little chap with a great black beaver
hat on she's gone up to some persons against the
Maypole. She is speaking to them — the boy appears
highly delighted , the other one is going to dance
with the boy and the girl is walking Slowly away
from all the rest and gone behind the Trees She's
opened the door of one of the little houses & walked
in Now its all going down —
( here only the appear portion Remained & taht part
became too powerful for my Seers Sight until she
had put her Smoked glasses on )
In the light a line hick looks Something
like a Sheet of glass, but which I cannot describe
now makes a plain for numbers of things to rest
little Animals, horses + Carts they seem to move
[???cha??ally] — theres trees houses people horses
Cows dogs rabbits cats — for miles and miles it
looks full. Churches public houses with their Signs
out & Shops but all different Shades — from White
to dark like a India ink drawing no colors
the people seem to walk a few steps & then stop
short and then do so again — nothing there
looks natural. — theres trees all straight without
leaves—till it comes to the top. the animals have
long necks and long bodies and very thin
and such little [?] of people, . dwarfs along
side the others . theres no way Young Children [?]
Infants —
175
theres a great quantity of the little ones going away
and the few left are getting larger — Its a sheet
You go into the sheet under a gateway , an arch
across the road it has a coat of Arms on it; the
Gate opens. and theres a street beyond, paved
and theres       in the road & flagstone pavemet
and there's those houses that the bed rooms comes out
beyond the bottom part. with woodwork , and the front
taht comes out has supports like pulling of wood
And the pavement is underneath eh bed room
window , and theres other houses. that do not
project so much , then theres one further on quite
Straight an a signboard [?] a [?] house.
with [[?]] long windows , but a [???ble] little door & a
piece fo wood slanting all over the top . it has
4 or 5 steps to it — all colorless on the opposite
side of the road theres a square Court yard goEs
in paved with White Stones. the houses do not
look like real houses but little houses cut out
like model paste board houses , Smooth & Clear,
Inside the paved Court yard theres
Some grave stones sticking up , the building
has a large round topped door with a great deal
of of snow and large hinges and a great latch — it is
a church or Chapel , a large door With such high
Narrow Windows — one has the Virgin Mary in the
glass with Child and a nimbus round her head
the other diwndow has two or 3 figures, now the
doors open theres a great many people standing
in front they are waiting or some one to come
out, they look in & then Come back and then
do so again — ut yet not naturally they movE
alike , their legs all movE together when one movEs
the other movEs — it looks like the end of a
large Church , I dare say theres nearly a

176 
hundred figures outside 
Theres a carriage with 4 horses Stopped right 
at the opening a little Coachman Sits up in front 
and two footmen Stands behind—Theres the soldier
Standing on the passment between the carriage 
and the Grave Stones hes looking in outside he 
Looks different from them they look like images 
but he looks like a little person 
Now theres Some one Coming out of the 
door theres two a little in front and one behind 
the two first are nearly black there cloths are so black 
its like a great cloak with a hood their heads are 
Shared a lot of beads round their necks, and a Cross 
theres something round their wrists and a bag in 
front ones Carrying a basin very much ornamented
on a Horned and the other’s carrying something, I never 
Saw like it on a Cushion and the one the middle 
behind looks Splendidly dressed only not in Colors 
a long robe that Sweeps the ground behind & a 
beautiful border [stich?] on the head a band round 
the forehead. theres a wonderful deal of work 
about his clothes—they look set with jewels and be has 
a cross in front as he comes out he dips his 
hand into the basin & throws it over the people
into their Eyes and all— hes a big man & very
proud looking — hes got out to where the soldier
stands and goes to pass him but the man
goes between and Shoves himself through just
as the fine one was going to get into the Carriage
the Soldier strided between and was going in
but the other stopped him they appear disputing
theres a great many behind them, hes offering
the man something out of the basin he looks
as though he wanted to touch the man with it
but the man wont be touched — then he has
77

sprinkled him tho' with the water out of the
basin - Now the Mans picked up a piece of
dirt and thrown at him - now he's gone off and
disappeared - the other is getting into the carriage
theres a great many behind him, some are giving
money to the people who stands outside
Somes got bags and give something larger like
little loaves out of the bags when they go out
they leave the procession and disperse going
different ways

There is a slight difficulty, but if it is
not convenient for you to finish it on

there is in no part of the New. a sentance
coming from one of a higher Authority
that speaks against it , indeed it tells of
many instances in which a meeting took
place between the two beings

by a ministering Spirit, his death was
wept for and his Selpulchre [[h???]] watched

2979
10259
Taking no heed of the blasphemies of
those having Church power. and entirely
setting aside their opinions, and reasoning
only from Christs life and words man
must believe
1st That there are those good angels
because they came at the time & with

taken from himself a Special office he

to follow and leaving it to their free will
to do so or not as they chose.
The appearance & Communion of Angels
commonly in the world to enforce such
doctrine would take away the merit of
those who from their own Choice & desire
lived in obedience to it.

But it seems to me surprizing that the Magl.
Practice of the Union & [Thr?] should have become
so utterly lost., the line of Jewish Priests have not
lost their other Ceremonials - & the use of it & method
of working one wd. suppose, so have been generally
known amongst the priests. & presented and uncontestable 
support of its divine Mission

2981 The Union & [Thr?] and the Crystal
10,261  Can be used for very Common purposes.
Yet it still to me seems strange that altho Crystal
work has been known so many Centuries & so much
practised -(& even during the last 30 years - amongst
my friends I know no one who has succeeded
well with it -) that no kind & good Spirits have
appeared to place Man in the path of Truth
Tho I have indeed cause to rejoice at my own
success.

Few have had your perseverance - None
have more Earnestly sought after it
2982  None less tamed it to their own advantage
10,262  in gaining money or other benefits from
it of the kind.

Altho I have been a seeker into the Occult [????ed]
33 years. & it is      since Mr Elliott gave me my
first Crystal & I have had the little Crystal 20 years
& my [In??om]. 11. - I might have given up the practise
in dispair or disgust if you had not kindly offered
to be my Spirit - instead of slander may I ask
181
how I came to be so famed.
2983
10,263
From your perseverance & long continued
Study of Spiritual matters I saw with
regret that having obtained success thru
a means of Communion You were rapidly
falling into Error through those with whom
You spoke, and that they were from
then [?i?ness] doing much harm with a
truth seeking Spirit —
I also knew that they were not absolutely Evil and they did not drivE
me away . I did not like to see a matter
heated so Seriously on the one side and
so lightly & frivolously on the other , and
I came to here I was wanted and not
asked for.
May I ask the Signification [?] of my former
Guardian Hunder Appearing in Blue with a
black patch [[?]] mark over one Eye. & as one [o]Old and
haggard.
2984
10,264
In accordance with the law that all
Spirit[s] must seem to be what it is, that
no disguise of the quality within may be
Effected. from the [exte??] garb
He had in time gone by been Mortal
And died heavily loaded with care
he had no Effected from his Aspirations
for the high any change in his nature.
After death. he was occupied with
the things around him , they seemed
to fill his mind and he did not enquire
into and test faithfully on those abovE
him — And so his dress did not
Approach the Colors of the light—and one
of his Eyes was colored up symbolical
[*182*]

of his dim perception of the Truth & 
his blind adherence to the feelings &
actions of the Mortal.

The Oval Crystal of which Hunder was Guardian was
given to me by a Mr Store in 1838 and Hunder infd.
me that in consequence of my working that Crystal he
became my GS. was that so

Yes he was attached to the crystal when
2985  you first received it and from your using
it he became attached to you-

I believe the Japan crystal had not
10,265  been used for divination until you took
it in hand, and was only kept valued
for the exceeding beauty of the Stone.

I know that as far back as
1738 Hunder was attached to the Small
Crystal but the party in whose possession
it was, was often in Need of his Services
and I think it probable that he kept
Hunder from advancement from the
worldly motives for which he used it
and in which he sought Hunders co-operation
readily given, assistance , instead of
heightening the man to the Spirits existence
he lowered the Spirit to the mans.

When Capt Burton was leaving England for his Expeditn.
to Mecca & Medina = I discharged Hunder at his legt.
from the GShip of that Crystal & dedicated it to Sotarus
I presented it to Lient. Burton. do you know if he
succeeded in using it.

He is still the guardian of it but
2986  has never given any Successful Visions
10,266  from the want of a proper Seer.
I also made him a Black Mirror had he any
Success with that
183

2987
10,267
Some Evil things appeared in it
I know now that such a mirror is
not good to be made - I thought once
that if such a mirror was made and
devoted to a good spirit - no harm wd.
come. but I know now they have not
sufficient control over the material of
which it is made.
Black to Evil Spirits is as blood
to the Bloodhound.

Then I did harm in making black Mirrors
for Earl Stanhope. [Dr Rohbumer?]. Mr Dresser. Mr Mosley
[Mr Ormerod?] + Dr Mackenzie.

2988
10,268
Dr Mackenzie's is an exception because
having a power of seeing himself he
can discharge it whenever any thing
may in the least create a doubt. in his
mind of its goodness.
I advised the black one for the
use of him to develop his faculties but
in the other cases where Capt Barton
has used slight invocations and that
for any appearance he might desire
or that liked to come of its own accord
has presented to be looked into of different
kinds natures + characters without
knowing much of them, then Evil has
good opportunity of showing itself.

does Ada - Constantine + Michael still remain
attached to my diffr crystals now I so rarely
request visions to be shown.

2989
10,269
They are willing to show them when
requested - but they know the reason of
your not calling them.

If any &c.

2996

I have no reason for appearing this Evening
except to satisfy you.

I did not know whether to request the vision to appear
or invoke you first, as I have done

10277  2997
You were right,
5' past 8 The CA left.

10278
The Vision Continued
The Mirrors clear, now its veiled here is the same
place come again, & the same same glass like
surface which seems to cover one immense plain
2
They are not the same buildings , its a larger space
not so many buildings but more people., theres a great
many people together in 3 or 4 places , it looks
further down the same Street as I can see the End
of the building with the Church window and at the
end of the Street theres an open place, with trees.
it is all colorless like india ink , the crowd which
looks like thousands of persons occupies only a few
inches some move about and some are on horseback.
they are round some buildings, they appear fighting
there looks like an old tower above them all
in the midst — its too small for me to See what they
are doing
Theres a Crowd here close together and
Something like the fireworks keep going up , they
are in a different direction from the people that are
fighting — those fighting seem in the dark or
shade , but these are quite light — Theres ano.r
larger number of people and in the middle theres
a little man Standing up in the middle in a pulpit
— then theres a smaller Crowd sitting down at
Tables, they are nearer to me, some are women
Sitting down , it seems a large dinner, theres one
large table across the top. and 3 or 4 comes straight
down from it. Its very light where these are, all
these crowds seem in a Circle — very nearly a Whole 
Circle — they are Coming this way now they've Stopped
The Soldier is there he is moving along
Quite alone , he does not seem like the rest, he is
going towards the place where they are eating, he
takes no notice of any one. ad they do not appear
to see him , he's gone up close to one of the Tables
and two of those sitting down get up and move
Away on Each side.    he does not sit down but
he keeps close to the Table theres something
3
on the Table like a plate, just before him — the
Table is Covered with things, and theres a goblet
on the side of the plate chased with [hand??] on Each
Side he has turned the plate upside down, he
has broken the tablet, & now he has broken the plate
in a great many pieces and thrown the pieces
away—Now hes turned round [& Coming] away
thou on the other side of the table do not Seem to See
him or even look at him — Now he's going to the
people where he preacher is —[[?]]the preacher has a
book open on the desk., he throws his arms about
and Seems So excited, he's much abovE the peoples
heads , the soldier has gone right thro' them hes gone
up into the pulpit and stands aside of the preacher
who does not seem to see him , they are about the
Same height, yet look So differently — the preacher
opens his mouth and thumps the book and the
Soldier puts his mouth close to the ear of the preacher
theres theres some little reading come between them
as though it was what the soldier said—hes poinitng
upwards & said
"You know that you blaspheme God"
The preacher stops & shakes but the soldier comes down he
looks so strange gliding about like a ghost , the people
dont Seem to See him when 3 or 4 persons Come along he
turns Sideways — he is going towards where they are
fighting — now where they are fighting covers such a
large space of ground that the furthermost are only
like specks — the Soldier's amongst them, he folds
his arms and altho in the thickest of the fight they
do not touch or See him, he is still dressed in doublet
Breeches & Great boots. , he's picked a Sword up off the
ground, there's a great many dead men + horses upon
the ground & rubbish like heaps of [?] Baskets and
[?]. broken guns. he stands close against that
4

with the sword in his hand he has put one
hand on the point of the blade + one on the handle
now hes put the middle across his knee + broke it.
+ thrown the pieces down on the heap + coming away
Now he's going to the fireworks, he is with
them in the front row looking at the things going
up - oh there seems to be cages all round these
fireworks and animals in them, its a circle and
the fireworks come on out of the middle with a few
people in it and the people who are looking on
appear to be standing upon a mound, and underneath
them on this side are cages of Wild Animals, the Soldier
is on the front row of the people. - he seems to smile
theres a little reading come under him -

2998
10279
"If you are merry rejoice but be not cruel
for wheres theres life theres feeling."

Theres a rail in front keeps them from falling over
where the wild beasts are. - theres more reading

2999
10280
"The trickeries of Art are harmless, but trifle
not with nature."

he seems to look in all their faces as he goes in +
out amongst them. now he is coming away

I said it was all in a circle and theres a
little white band about half the width of my nail
goes all round these things, its only a white mist
on the band is
"The Events of the Earth"

10281
the man goes up to where those words are + he feels
with his hand all along over the words + even long
past them. he is coming this way - he is a great
way from either of the crowds, but inside the band
but outside the band theres quite different
things but I cannot look at both, the Soldier 
himself is getting more shadowy, sometimes he 
seems to change, and then to be [coarser ?]. [?] 
again and then lighter and goes on quicker.

Now he's come to a house. with the likeness 
of his own house, but the [?] gone and the flowers, 
but the house is exact he's going into it he's in the 
room again - I see inside now.  It's exactly the
same and there's two men sitting at the table
One's dressed all in black,  like black {glass}, shiny
and the other dressed in clothes light, dark
[?] both men, they have coats on but not like
coats more like jackets [??] little tails, the
2nd one has lace over his hands, they have some
money on the table[s]. The one in black has writing
materials before him, he leaves off writing and
takes in some of the pieces of money, and puts
them down one on the top of the other, so [?}
counted and pushed them steadily across of the
other, he is doing the same to another lot, the
other man has put his hand over and pulled
them towards him - The soldier is close behind
him and he has put his hand over the other ones
shoulder on to the table and put his hand
sideways between the two lots of money. They
do not seem to see him - [?] the man has took
one lot up and pushed the other lot towards
the man in black. And the other in his jacket 
he seemed to [?] as tho he intended to put 
both lots into his jacket.
 Now the soldier is going all around the 
room looking at every thing.  Now he's come
out of the house he looks down on the ground
very sad and walks toward the [??]
where the {/} are - he's stepped over the land 











no. 1 began on the beak.
6

he looks back with his face over his shoulder
and theres a little reading under him.

3000
10282
"The last hour with the Associations of
life is past, and now to seek memories
death"

Theres a curious thing outside the band
not near enough for me to see plainly, he is going
towards it with his back this way. they are
beyond the band. the circle now is coming this
way as I can only see half. - theres like two
square blocks of stone. outside the band., + on the
top is like a stone ball and on Each ball a bird
with its feet on the ball large birds covered with
feathers the feathers all over the bird keep
ruffling up from the tail to the top of the head
keep turning up the wrong way and then go back
again, they do not appear real birds and under
each feather there's a number a figure, Every feather
has a figure under it. some I see on the back as
20-30 - and on the head 5-6 &c the feathers are
large they appear crimped and they keep turning
up regularly. they appear something like scales
the feathers are all one shape and overlay each
other like scales, they stand on each side of a 
passage, and the soldier is going towards them
their beaks are turned towards Each other inwards
and their tails spread out like fans -
The numbers go regular as far as the back
of the neck which is numbered up to 30. and
then begins one again and goes on to 30. which is the
middle of the back and then begins 1 again up to another
30 comes to the bottom of the back and theres 1 to
30 straight across the Tail + 1 to 30 on the heart
theres no feather on the legs, and one to 30 on
each wing - and a number on each eye - 100 on each
eye _
The passage which goes down on each side
has a cover on the top supported by two pillars
it seems all stone. pillar and all. it looks
quite like a loom inside, the backs a wall and
halfway up a white stone shelf, theres a good
many spirits, some with wings looking so
anxiously at the figures as the feathers [?] up
some looking at one part and some at another
the soldier is looking at the number on the
tent of one of them
On the shelf theres seven books signed in 
the back. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7 and a little behind
above the figures.
10283
THE
LAW
1
The soldier is looking so intently at the
birds tail and one particular feather keeps on
turning over that has 3 under it now he is
going towards the books.
The shelf the books rest on is double
one half under the other with a hinge and he has
brought it our and made it double the width
he has taken down vol 1 they are big books
(folios) he is turning over the leaves and the
printing is in several lines together and theres a 
small space and [so?] down the book but some
paragraphs are much longer than the others
Now he has turned another page over on the
top of one of the paragraphs This is No 3. He takes
nearly all down the page, he stops there and puts

hand out he's turned [?o??nd] a little — If I
could see as well as at first I could lead it.
Requested — the vision to be Cont'd another Evening

10284  I shall be able to give you the concluding
part of the book. of which you have already
received the first.

May I ask when it will be convenient for us to be 
favored with a Continuation of the Vision.
3002  Next Friday if it will be convenient for you to
10285  look, if not it must be Tuesday,
I wish if possible to go to Ms. I. on Friday = & take one
of my crystals. Which had I better take.

3003  The Ispem Crystal is the smallest consecreted
one you have. and you had better take that

it. — and being uncertain of her power of 
Sight, it is not advisable to call Spirits of
a high order who would have power by their
appearance of dispelling all fear or painful
remembrance in darkness or else when

the person inspecting are harassed & disquieted

had I better request a Vision of the Spirit of the Crystal
or Solicit Ada to Show the Vision.

3005   You had better ask Ada to Show the desired
10288   Vision.

As I do not use either of my Crystals now once in three
months do they lose their power or do the Spirits
neglect their Charge.
 
3006  They do no desert them and will always
10289   Appear with the same power, if they are able
when called, and if not able at that time
they will name another

Will you kindly request Ada to Show a Vision in the 
Japan Crystal when Called

I will do so. but at the same time Ada
3006   or any other Spirits power cannot make her
10290    See unless the faculty is in herself as well
as in them.

Can you tell me when it will be Convenient for me
to receive the promised poem from the Spirit of Byron

3008   I cannot name at once at time for his
10291    appearance.

Then I have your leave to repeat the question at
another time

3009   You have, and I will mention it at the 
10292    Earliest opportunity.

The "Waterloo Tragedy" has not yet been discovered
I should be pleased if any At Spirit would tell me
the name of the deceased

3010  he would not be at all unpleasant now to 
10293   be seen any more than any other person.

I explained that if I could see myself I should be
most desirous of doing so, but I had no right
to urge my Seer to do so.

3011  I cannot see that there can be any
10294
10

objection when you have an assurance
from his indistinct appearance he could not 
be distinguished from a being who had died 
under different circumstances.
     I was as careful that he should not 
appear when I knew that he was unfit 
to do so, as I am now willing to show it 
from the removal of that obstacle.

Whilst I was asking my seer if she had any object'n 
to see the deceased, there came.

3002   10295     I have no reason to urge it -- It would be 
neither to his interest or to the public for the 
person who did it is beyond human reach.
dead to the world as he is --
     The longer you wait the better he will 
be able to communicate, but it would not be 
until his 2nd appearance that he could do 
so freely -- no deceased person can.
     First they understand you only by 
gestures and signs, next a deeper spiritual 
faculty is awakened  and they answer you
with the mind.

I will then defer it.

3003     10296     I can say again that the appearance 
has at the present time, nothing to make it 
repulsive but that every day makes its 
comprehension more distinct of your 
questions & observations.

I will then defer it until the vision is completed 
May I ask if the vision we are receiving is a 
representation of an Event that has actually taken 
place or only symbolical of what takes place 
hereafter.

3004    10297       An actual representation of what has 
taken place and also symbolical of what
[*11*]

does take place every day in the progress of
others who are like him true to their faith

May I ask your view of the best mode of dealing with 
the Hindoo Mohammedan population of India
when the actual revolt is quelled - whether we should
Endeavor to Christianize them by Missionaries dispersed
amongst them & consequently occupying (judging from
the present Efficacy of the miss'y labors) an indefinite space
of time - or as some ultra pious people propose
use the strong arm of the conqueror & force the wild
doctrines of Christianity upon them at the point of the
Bayonet -

3005
10,298
Their religion should be left untouched
An uncivilized people such as they who
have revolted if living under a civilized 
government must be ruled with a strong
hand. but only so far as the interest of the
Nations are concerned.
     Rule them as Man may rule Man
the weak in subservience to the strong
but not as GOD may rule Man, humbling 
them body and soul before a self elected
divinity -
     So far as their mind & their spirit
is concerned let them be of their own
opinion and follow their own course for
if they have a conscience their own religion
the religion of their fathers will touch 
it and raise them towards good, but 
if they have no conscience the forced
doctrines of the hated Church and Sect
would make them far worse than they would
be even had they no religion of their own
and turn the man into an Evil Spirit, in flesh,

Among them men of kindness & humanity

their wants and teaching them.  they are

that remains of his Earthly existance and

upon the assurance that he gives
of his everlasting assistance but not speak
of it openly — not spout to unwilling
listeners and force it down their throats
as it were when their blood is boiling with
rage at what they deem the interference
of devils — and when I say - this would
be best I not only give my own opinion
but express the opinion of every one of us
who witness the fearful struggle, and
who know every one that it was furthest
of all from the desire of him who died
upon the Cross. that the foot of it should
always be died with blood.

I was returning thanks when Emma said here is
more writing coming.

3006
10299
I was about making a short observation
but if you have not time I will withdraw
it.

I beg to be favored with it

3007
10300
Men who enforce Christianity with all
[*13*]

their might, no matter by what means
upon unbelievers should consider themselves
for a moment placed in their opponents
position
I see nothing contemptible in the 
adherence by them to a law which their
religion prescribes for them. Even of the
carrying out of it be perfectly ridiculous if
considered in any other light.
Now the Brahmins consider the pig
an unholy animal and their religion will
not allow them to partake of it. because their
book strong to them as the bible. of Europe
tells of the Spirits that are in them.  of
their possession - and strictly forbids the using
of their bodies for any purpose under penalty
of eternal punishment - And if this is
believed in by the faithful, the enlightened
Men of good understanding and by them

do that which is justifiable by their Law.
when they commit the greatest atrocities
in putting down their oppressors -
And as a follower of Christ in his way has
believed himself to be a martyr and given
himself up to death in the conflict to

and he wd defend his faith with the same
exertions and the attack on their proscated

3009    10302     Yes I will show you part of the Vision this 
Evening. I am glad that you have called me
and wish you to do so as often on Tuesday
Evenings as you possibly can if it is only 
for a moment or two

I explained

3010   10303   I thought you might be scrupulous of Calling
me if you had not an opportunity of holding
a lengthened Communication --

That is so. When unable to have the usual sitting I was
afraid it w'd look disrespectful to call you

If any &c

3012   10305   I have nothing particular to say, and I will 
not stay longer so that you may have the 
Vision longer

May we have the last part of the Vision repeated that 
my Seer may if allowable read the volume the Soldiers
appeared reading

3013   10306     The reading depends upon the Strength of

suffering  the slightest evil or mischief upon
any Spirit with whom they may at any time
associate or be connected with that Spirit --
being of their own grade or any of the others
different to them - or if it [is] so happen one
embodied in the flesh living upon earth
but he must never when conversing with a 
Single being cause him disquietude by 
adverting thoughtlessly to any common
subject   he must only   Seek another with a 
fixed purpose of obtaining necessary information
and when the desired question is answered
If the discourse is confirmed he to whom you 
go must be the questioner -- no extraneous subject
must be treated upon by you until first
advanced by him lest you cause painful emotions 
or animosity from conflicting opinions about a
Subject on which you do not both think
alike.  therefore when one Spirit seeks another
with an object, and that object is accomplished 
by a favor from the one sought-- if a further
conversation is carried on the one sought is to
by the questioner and the one who has received the 
favor is bound to confine himself to the subject
upon which he is questioned"

That is all in that paragraph  the next is No 4 - Now
the soldier has shut the book up - he is standing as
though thinking  theres another one come now.  Its a
spirit with wings and taken down the 4 Volume from
the end.  hes opening and reading it the paragraph he's
reading begins with capital letters

3015   10308   "ARCHANGELS are so far entrusted with
the Holy Spirits power as to produce in a certain
degree -----

Now the Soldier's coming away - this necessitated my Seer's
leaving off reading the remainder of the paragraph  in
the book  to watch the soldier's motions -- now the 
temple's going -- and the outside & the birds - all gone
the soldier is coming to the left of the Mirror -- the
temple went out on the right.  he's stooped down
and picked up a large round green leaf  like a 
Victoria Regia - off the ground - its very thin & filmy
but there are no trees about   he's sat down  the place
looks all sand a level plain -- hes laid the leaf down
at his side and pressed it down flat with the palm
of his hand and took up some of the sand and
sprinkled it over the leaf  now hes taken up the leaf
and shaken it about and then thrown the sand
off and the leaf appears now quite transparent -- he's
laid it down again & hes writing with his forefinger
upon it  and where his finger's been over theres a white
raised mark come  he is going over it in straight
lines -- now he's done  its not writing but six lines of
curious little figures  as thought done with chalk, white
on green.  this one in the first row.
17 

     Now the soldier is getting up and taken the leaf 
hes going away with it —  Theres a little temple come 
very faint in the distance its like a Chinese temple 
of many colors.    the roofs inlaid with different colors 
with much blue about it,   there’s some one standing 
in the door way with a tight fitting  scarlet dress 
& long & full blue robes over it.  and a plain gold 
band round his head — his complexion very dark 
and hair very black.  he shows his teeth which are 
very white indeed — the soldier is still in the same 
form of doublet and breeches but colorless & quite shadowy 
hes given the leaf to the one in the scarlet dress, who 
is looking at it   when he gave it to the othe he 
Stepped back a few steps and the other one has 
Stooped down,  and taken up a handful of sand 
& sprinkled it over the leaf  and  shaken it off again 
and pressed the leaf between his hands and now 
theres nothing on the leaf  its just as it was at first 
Now hes put it on one hand and is writing with 
his finger — all sorts of figures — a great many   now 
hes done.— these are in the first line 

10309  [see line of figures opposite]

Now he has given the soldier the leaf who is going 
away with it — the other one has put his hand on 
the soldiers shoulder & stopped him & hes turned 
back. the one in scarlet is standing on the 
Threshold, the soldier a little below  they appear 
talking — now hes coming away, his arms are 
folded and his head bent down.

My seers health prevented our sitting longer last Tuesday 
Will you favor us with a Cont'n of the Vision this Evening 

3016    10310    Yes. 

As my Seer could not continue to read the paragraph
relating to the Archangels in one of the Vol's of the Law & at
the same time watch the Spirit of the Soldier may I 
ask if you could favor us with it at another time 

3017    10311    You could see that any time when they are 
opening it 

As I am afraid my Seer will not be well enough to 
go to Lime house,  I presume I have still your permis'n 
to receive the [prom] book on Spiritualism from Eltesmo
in this mirror 

3018    10312    You have

you would be able to keep your kind 
promise of assisting M Lea in receiving from
Eltesmo a proof of his Guardianship & Care.
 
Shall you kindly inform Eltesmo [?] will [?] 
[?] to meet his wishes

3019    10313      I will do so 

If any &c

I shall be happy to hear what you have to say & also 
to do as you wish 

3021    10315    I am quite extraneous from the matter 
myself — but he not having the priviledge of 
of appearing himself  is unable to convey to 
you his wishes 
     he desired me to say that through you 
he should be much gratified to communicate 
with his charge as he is unable otherwise
19

to communicate with him with any amount
of freedom.

Will you please also - to inform [Elte] Sevenomina that
I will take an Early Friday for the purpose

10318                   The Vision Continued

     Now I can see the soldier he is going away
with his back towards me and beyond him as
far as I can see theres a thick white wall
about half the height of the mirror  solid looking
as thou cut out of Opal.  theres openings in the
wall at equal distances from the ground about
half way up with a figure on each side of each
[Illustration]  aperture,  they are spirits with wings but
dark hair and dark eyes and very large. The
soldier has taken the leaf out of the front
of his dress  he is getting near them hes
given it to one of them and gone through
one of the openings -
     Now the wall is coming this way, its gone,
the soldier is now in a very clear place shining
with light all over   at the further End theres a 
cave with long points hanging down like Crystals
of glass  and the outside is yellow and rough
all the pavement is like clear glass and theres
a pedestal with a bird chained by the leg, bird
& all is like crystal  and at the back  theres a 
row of buildings of the same with a road way
leading to them quite smooth & clear but at the
20
sides its yellow and rough- at the further end
of the cavern theres some lights - the soldier is
changing so much he's getting quite clear and
from the shape of his clothes, he is getting almost
shapeless and losing his features, the lights in
the Cavern flicker up and down in many flames
one on each side- he man is going in there,
many other figures about like himself you cannot
tell that they are people beyond these lights in
the Cave theres a very large running stream and the
other side of the water at the back of the cave there
an image or picture beautifully colored, the water
runs along at the foot of it. It's a single figure 
nailed to the cross. its beautifully  done the
back of it is like clear glass. the cross is of brown
wood. color and drapery hanging from the left
shoulder down to the knees of a purple color. and on 
the head a gold crown with stones in it, but the
two great lights keep flaming up and down so much
as to under it indistinct it projects from the wall
but yet does not seem like a carving, the figure
has black eyes and black hairm the form upon
the cross does not look spiritual - the eyes are very
peculiar and the mouth open the face bent
downwards but the eyes turned upwards. Theres
a scroll on the wall over the head with figures
on thus.
10319 [drawn figure]
All this time the man seems striving to [?] off
the pavement he rises a little and keeps up and
then descends again and his shadow flickers about
21
upon the water he is lifting up his Arms as
though hoping to fly over the water. — NO he is
trying to make his shadow touch the Crucifix
now he has done it he is abovE he ground a little
way which makes his shadow longer and it has
touched the Crucifix now he is going just ovEr his
Shadow without touching the water but his Shadow
seems to remain there altho he is gone over
Now he is on the other side and has
knelt down — I cannot make out the shadow that
was on the water for now it has risen up & formed
an arch like a bridge behind him — now theres a 
Spirit come into the CAvE. I did not see when from
he stands this side the Water — a beautiful
Spirit with white gauze dress the lowEr part a
Cloud or Mist — plain band round the head & light
hair. fine and silky Gold Color but not at all
Curly down to the waist. A most delicate looking
face — a light blue mantle the dress like gauze
the mantle delicate Silk a most Spiritual figure
the hands almost transparent , the mantle hangs
loose and fastened in the front with a large ([?])
Stone like a brooch. the wing are like white feathery
down.
The Soldier is coming back ovEr the
bridge he has lost his shape now. — only like a
little Cloud — now he is Coming out of the
Cave. along with this Spirit close at the
Side of him they touch. they are going along
together — the Cave is going out at the right
side of the Mirror & they are going to the left
the spirit in the blue. mantle touches the man
with one hand and the other is pointed out
Straight — now I see the other side of the
wall I saw before they are going towards
22

it and now besides the door like openings theres 
a round opening which they are going towards 
theres a black [figure] frame round the opening 
and a transparent substance fills the space and 
projects forward like a ball in the wall set in 
a black frame, and just in the middle of the 
surface theres a little groove, its turning round 
towards me I can see thoroughly it magnifies very 
much and theres such a beautiful place the 
other side a long distance off like a landscape 
& homes - people walking about and shops and 
shop fronts. - pavements - trees little houses 4 [?] 
the spirit & man are going towards it now the 
spirit has put the man in front of him & [?] 
his own eyes but first he turned his head way 
he has put his hand on the top of the soldiers 
head & points with his arm to what I can see 
thro the hole.

The man has turned round from the 
hole towards the spirit and shook (his head) 
the upper part of his form - and they are coming 
away together . - (now I cannot see so plain) 
the wall is turning outwards and going away 
& they are going upwards now theres a division 
going across clear glass like but purple tinged 
above their heads like a ceiling on the top of it 
there are beautiful gates whole gates with a 
purple tinge ([above their heads like a ceiling]) 
[at] on the top of the gates - they are very much 
ornamented - they are going towards them 
but to get at the gates they have to come very 
far this way and then go up - now they 
have come upside next the gate and turned 
both round - and the spirit has put its arm 
right round the man - from [?] though [?]
23

it and with the other hand points down to the hole
he looked thro' just now -- & then he points to the
cave where the image was -- now hes turned  the
man round  round and pointed to the inside
of the gate -- the man form[s] bends nearly  the 
middle of the body over the spirits arm  which
seems entirely to support it =

8h 5 PM             Invoked the C A.
The C A is here
I have called you this Evening prior to requesting the
Continuation of the Vision -- in conformity with you wishes

3024   10320    I do wish it
I will continue the Vision for a short time
this Evening

As a new year is now opening upon us -- I look forw'd
with much pleasure to receiving as a New Years gift
the concluding book on Met. Philosophy  - which I
hope to receive

3025   10321   You Shall

If my seers health prevents my calling on Tuesday
& Wednesday being the night for Eltesmo to favor
Mr Lea with a cont'n of his work  I will with your
permission call you then.

3026   10322   I will appear first, but I would rather
that you called me also on the Tuesday if
only for a few moments

On one Tuesday /   /  when my Seers voice failed
her I called the Spanish Monk to produce his MS
for my Seer to Copy  I hope that did not displease
you
24

3027   10323   Not at all
I have a different reason from that for
wishing to appear regularly about this time

If any &c

3028   10324   I have not

May I then receive the vision

3029   10325   I will show it - "The Man having renounced
the memory of the past is about to take
upon himself the clothing of the future Soul.

The C A left 17' past 8 PM.

The Vision Concluded

10326   Now theres the gates come and theres the
Spirit and the man just as when I left off
The one bending over the Arm of the other.
Now a little doorway in one of the gates has
opened, the gates are of open work  a great deal
higher than their heads -- high in the middle
& lower at the sides
     Now the gates have come this way  it is
very bright indeed through them  theres an
immense number of figures in the distance  very
faint but quite a crowd of them  the man
& the Angel are going towards them  theres a
semi=circle of [?] pillars & a great number of the
spirits are standing in a half circle near them
& the middle is also filled with spirits  these
now are going towards them  the place is exceed'ly
light  the front is open but theres a roof
on the top of the pillars - tho you can see thro it
     The roof is just as tho' composed of feathers of
an extremely light blue, tinged at the edges

25

     either with gold or a very golden light shining
beautifully, the Spirits are all in white dresses
but their robes and borders are slightly colored
they all have something on their heads  Some
are a good deal taller than others -- some have
round things in their hands about the size of plates
& apparently feathery -- which they are now laying
down in a heap making a curious shaped pile
of them  theres 50  I should think of them  they
are placed round in a heap  with a hole left in the
Middle -- Now the man & the Angel have got up to
them.  And the spirits next the building have come
out and have closed quite round them keeping
them in the middle  theres a great number now
& they have hidden the two others from me --
     Now I can see the figure of the man
he is on the top of the pile  at least half on &
half out of the hole which was left, now he's changing
his face is coming again  and his hair  he is
rising up gradually out of it, and as he rises
he gets more perfect -- his head and hair are now
quite perfect & his shoulders are getting plain &
so is the band at the at the neck  where the gathers are
theres shadowy wings -- they are getting plainer
the tops bright -- pink wings -- Now he has risen
up as far as the waist and a band has come
round the waist, a pink band, now the skirt
of the dress is forming  that is now quite perfect
close to the band & round the hips & then it gets
shadowy and the folds are lost  the last part
which has risen out of the heap  is only like a
cloud, large & covering the whole of the lines  part
entirely -- now the figure is quite out.
     Each of the Spirits have taken up one of
the round things again as they put them down
26
they carry them in their front on the dress but under
the robe—so you can only see the middle & not the Edge,
Now they have separated n two rows making an
Avenue for the Man & Angel to pass through. they
go upwards [?] and at the top of them at the [?]
theres something so excessivE bright that I
Cannot distinguish what it is , theres a great
number of Spirits all with wings more than a
 hundred I should think in the two long [?]
they differ in their features & faces, they are all
handsome, yet not alike, — The man has very
much the same face he had when alive — only
greatly changed clearer & spiritual.
The two are going up towards the
bright place they appear as though Joined
together the cloud that is under them is only
one that is they are perfect to a little below
the waist & then they are not distinguishable
apart , they place they are going towards looks
now like a square of very bright luminus Gold
and in the Middle of it a star of purple stones
they twinkle [light] like Stars they are seven
characters in one row made with Ametysts
now the two are getting near it , Now they are
Close to it. — they were [?] side by side
but now they've turned nearly face to face, their
shoulders however still touching — they havE
Stopped Still a minute — And all the Spirits
have bowed thEir heads — now the square piece
of Gold has opened down the Middle and they
have gone through. — its closed again — the light
inside [?] opened was most intense.—The Spirits
outside have raised their heads again and
its all going— its clear—
"The vision is finished"
9 PM.

We were Sitting Conversing about the Vision closing
so unexpectedly — When Emma said — the Mirror is
Clouding again & the CA has Come back.
9.5.'
I returned thanks for the Vision — when the CA said
3030
10327
The passing of a Man, I mean an intelligent
being from the body to its highest and
most heavenly Spiritual existence, and
the incidents that invariably take place
in that passage through death and
unlimited space has been shown as
well as it can be depicted to a material
Eye. — Poor, weak, as such scenes are
when brought down to meet such a sight
an idea can then scarcely be formed
of what they are in their gorgeous
Reality— their perfection as Spirituality
is lost when they have the semblance
of material however fine and delicate
and yet such scenes cannot be pictured
to mans mind at all. unless they are
Clothed slightly with his own attributes
so that if I failed in representing them
beautiful as they are the image is
as complete as our different positions
will allow.—
3031
10328
I have appeared again to desire
that you will Review it with Care, and
that if you find in it, any remarkalbe
parts. I will most willingly answer
you upon them in explanation , there may
be some that you havE not understood
such I can make plain

                       Invoked the C A
7' past 8 PM.
I have not had time to make any comments upon the
Vision you have favored me with -- tomorrow is the time appt'd
for Eltesmo's appearance -- will it be necessary for me
to call you before I invoke Eltesmo

3132   10329   Yes call me
I am not so anxious to appear because I have
any thing of importance to communicate as
because I know that my presence [an Evil]
alone dispels an Evil.
     As Eltesmo will have I have no doubt a
lengthened Communication to make tomorrow
Evening you had better begin as early as 
you conveniently can, and not stay until
8 oClock.

have we your permission to see the Spirit of the person
whose remains were found on Waterloo Bridge

3033   10330   You have.

Is Capt. Anderson alive & well.

3034   10331   he is alive but wounded  I have been informed
by his G S.

I believe Capt R G Benton is still in Africa  may
we have a Vision of him in the Evani Glass on Tuesday
next.

3035   10332   I do not know whether he could appear
I will enquire

If he appears in the Evani Glass  shall we be able
to converse with him -- or will it be only a Vision

3036  10,333   Only a Vision  a picture introduced
by Spirits

The there would be no difficulty I presume in
Evanis showing that vision

3037   10334   I do not know that he w'd have any objection
to show it

29

When Capt Benton was in Arabia I had a Vision wch 
from his [?] Work, appears to have been a correct one 
and I sh'd like to have another

3038 
10335 I will let Evani know what you desire and 
he will shew it you

Will Evani appear if called just in [t]his Glass.

3039 
10336 Evani himself had better appear in this 
the Evani glass is intended only for Visions 
and the likenesses of people - here he could 
answer your questions

Would you kindly ask him to appear on Tuesday

3040 
10337 I will

If my seers cold is not worse I will appoint 
Friday week for Seven o mina Comm'n to Dr Mackenzie

3041 
10338 I will tell him, he will be much pleased 
I think Mr Lea is improved under the 
Guardianship of Eltesmo.

I have been informed there is a Gentleman at Nott'm 
who has the faculty of seeing spirits without the 
aid of a Mirror or Crystal. are you aware of it

3042 
10339   No not even of his existence, although 
such a state could be obtained by any 
fully developed medium

On Saturday Evening last (   ) about 9 PM. my 
seer who having a bad cold had gone early to bed, was 
laying awake - saw an aged woman apparently about 
60. short gray hair little grey eyes  thin  - a black 
cap on   a black dress & black silk [?] with 
border & fringe come from the fire place across the 
bed where she was laying - leaving an impression 
of weight & go out at the door - may I ask if 
that was a Spirit - or merely an illusion of the Senses

3043
[103]40  Such things are not Hallucinations

Would you then permit her to appear in this
30 
Mirror that we might caution her not to appear 
in that manner again as tho my Seer has excellent 
Nerves, She of course does not wish to develope that 
faculty of Seeing Spirits — except when invoked

3044 
10341    I am unacquainted with that woman 
personally — I do not know by what names 
you could call her, although if such was 
Ascertained She could be compelled to appear 
Even against her will. 

Could you then prevent their appearing thus to her 

3045 
10342    I cannot control you Seers vision — Seeing in 
the mirror as She does more Clearly and 
advancing imperceptibly  perhaps to you to 
a more perfect State of mediumship  Such 
appearances as that cannot surprise one 

I explained my wishes and requested a Seal ag't it

3046 
10343    My power I would willingly exert but 
how could I impregnate a Seal that would 
be of value when I am not her G S. 
     I know of the forms of Seals but they 
are useless. unless impregnated with the 
Strength of the Spirit who may be in 
connection with the panty wearing them 

If you will give me the form.    I would get one 
made of Silver of any other material you may 
deem best and request Tresev to impregnate 
it. 

3047 
10344    When I appear again then I will give you 
Such a Seal to copy 
     But it must be made to meet a 
peculiar case, for while you desire to get 
rid of the visible out ward appearance you 
do not wish to destroy the whole of the power 
of Spirit Seeing — the line must be finely 
drawn that distinguishes the two  one from
31
the other.
I will think upon it
I explained that my Seer used her faculty of Spirit
Seeing solely to meet my wishes , & that she had her
Wish to see spirits under any other Circumstances
3048
10345
I quite understand it , but in general
when a seal is made agt. the influence of
Spirits and to prevent their appearance, all
such is meant. — And much [con??d] as
the faculty of spirit sight may be it is
not in every way desirable — or more would
be possessed of it.—
I do not mean a Communication with a
higher order of Spirits , but with sight of
the supernatural.
I wish I had the faculty.—
3049
10346
where that faculty is not inherent, all
the Spirits of the universe Could not create
it.
They may call it into active life, feed
it strengthen its growth. make it perfect
but where the Seed is not what can be
worked upon.
But however much you may desire the
Power of Seeing You will believe me when I
Assure you most earnestly that it is far
better you should not. —
You could not do it. If you entered into it
it would entirely engross your attention
ruin you worldily. for if these things are
profitable they are no good.—
And then you would not be satisfied with
What you are you are now, but unmindful
of your Nerves or Strength. Seek farther
for visions of a different Character And
I had let the fire out. I took the lamp away with me because the
room  quite dark  but the Mirror appeared as luminous
& the C A as vivid as before
32

Men may go on seeing without mixing 
otherwise with bad or evil influences, until 
the balance of the mind is lost. for there 
are sights, regions that a Spiritual Eye may 
penetrate, that reason cannot look upon 
unmoved -

It has always been my endeavor 
my firm purpose to avoid and oppose 
the appearance of every thing that would 
lead to aught save interest, gratification 
and well being in this world as well as 
future happiness

Will you allow me to leave the room for 2 minutes.

3050 
10347 Yes.

On what Evening may we receive your Concluding 
Work may I suggest Tuesday-week

3051 
10348 It is a completion of the old Work 
and the one I shall now give you completes 
that subject

When you have spoken to me of publishing 
it some future day, of having an idea of it, 
I objected to it because it was incomplete. 
it needs a concluding p art and if published 
a spiritual preface instead of the Vision.

I must mention again that when I 
gave it to you it was without the slightest 
intention of its ever being put in the form 
of a printed book. - only given by me to you 
as a mark of my individual esteem, being 
the only thing you could receive from one who 
can only present things to the sight.

The Vision at the beginning is not necessarily 
connected with them and instead of that 
I will give you a preface to follow your 
own introduction =
MURDER, AND MUTILATION OF THE BODY
AMONG the many murders, the records of which have lately darkened our
pages, this, from its accessories, stands out in ghastly prominence.  On
Friday morning last were discovered on one of the buttresses of
Waterloo-bridge the mangled and mutilated remains of the body of a 
gentleman who had evidently been murdered, and whose body had afterwards
been hacked into a thing of shreds and patches. This hewing of
the body of the victim after death calls to mind the similar doings of 
Greenacre and Good – both of whom after murdering their victims cut up 
their bodies – the former distributing the portions in different parts of the
metropolis, and the latter burning the remains.
The particulars of this most barbarous deed will be best gathered from 
the evidence given at the inquest which was held on Monday, at the
board-room of the Strand Union, by the Coroner for Westminster and a
jury of sixteen inhabitants.
The jury having viewed the remains at the police-station
James Barber, a youth seventeen years of age, was first examined.  He
said : I live at No. 2, Lumley-court, Strand, and work for Messrs. Smith
and Son, coal-merchants.  I was going up the river in a boat from Greenwich,
on Friday morning last, between five and six o'clock in the morning,
and I saw the carpet-bag (the bag was produced) lying on the third
buttress of Waterloo-bridge.  It was lying down on the side.  I was two
arches away from it when I saw it first.  We pulled alongside, and Frank
Kilsby, who was with me, took hold of a string that was attached to the
bag and handed it to me.  We pulled the bag into the boat, and then we
rowed as hard as we could to Lambeth, where Frank's brother lived.  We
did not open the bag on the way.  When we got to Lambeth we took the
bag into a barge, and John Kilsby, who was on the barge, opened it.  It
was locked, I think.  We forced it open.  It contained a lot of bones and
clothes.  There was one bone sticking out above the rest.  We then put
the bones back again into the bag and rowed back to the Adelphi, and
gave the bag into the hands of the police.  It was just high water when
we found the bag, which lay on the buttress, about six inches above the
level of the water.  I do not think the bag was wet.  I did not touch the 
clothes, but I saw they were very wet, though not dripping.
Police Sergeant William Buck, 5 F, said : About eight o'clock on Friday
morning two lads came to the station, accompanied by Police-constable
Venes, and stated that they had found a carpet-bag on one of the abutments 
of Waterloo-bridge.  They added that they had taken it up to Lambeth
and showed it to their brother, who told them to row back to the
Adelphi and give the things to the police.  The clothes consisted of a
brown over-coat, a black frock-coat, a black cloth waistcoat, dark mixture
trouser, a calico shirt, a merino inner vest, pair of drawers, and one
sock.  I found blood on the shirt, and inner shirt, and coat.  On further
examination I found seven cuts through the inner shirt and the region of
the heart, and also cuts on the inner coat.  I examined the clothes very
carefully, but could find no marks or writing upon them by which they
could be identified.  I then sent for the surgeon to the constabulary.
Mr. R.B. Paynter, 33, Brydges-street, surgeon to the F division police,
said :  On Friday morning, the 9th of Oct., about nine o'clock, I was called
to the station, and shown the carpet-bag now produced, which contained
a quantity of bones.  The bones shown to the jury are the same.  The 
clothes produced were lying by the side.  I then took the bones out of the
bag, and proceeded to examine them.  Having put the bones together, to
discover whether all of them belonged to one individual, I found they did
so belong, and that there was a complete skeleton, with these exceptions :
the parts wanting were the head, the whole of the cervical and seven of
the dorsal bones; several portions of the ribs, likewise the bones of the
hands and feet, the third portion of the left fibula, and the left clavicle.
The bones that I found were almost all sawn into one or more portions.
All the bones and parts of bones had portions of muscle attached to
them, the parts cut off having been detached in a rough, haggled manner
– that is, not taken off by a scientific person, or with a sharp knife.  Four
portions of skin only remained on the bones – a piece of considerable size
being at the back of the right wrist, covered with dark hair, showing that the
deceased had been a vigorous adult.  The flesh adhering to the bones was
neither fresh nor in a state of decomposition generally, there being incipient 
decomposition only apparent in the left acetabulum, and the corresponding
thighbone.  The capsular ligament of the right hip-joint was
cut open ; and, on rotating the head of the thighbone, I perceived a strong 
smell of decomposition, and several blue marks produced thereby.  The
remainder of the muscles and bones appeared to be undecomposed ; and, on
seeking to discover the cause of this, I found in several parts a saline gritty
matter, looking like salt.  To this I attribute the preservation of the remains.
The remains look as if they had been submitted to salt.  The
surface was reddish brown, and presented a brighter red when cut into,
just like salt meat.  I should have said the whole of the heart, lungs,
stomach, and viscera are missing.  In regard to the pieces of ribs which I
examined, I found a large portion of probably the second, third, 
and fourth ribs of the left side, with a piece of the sternum attached,
and having flesh adhering.  In this piece (probably between
the third and fourth ribs) was a cut of rather a smaller size than
the holes in the shirt and under-waistcoat, which portion of ribs, when


placed in the natural position, had the stab or hole exactly corresponding
in position and direction as in the clothes.  The long axis of the cut was
up and down, and the wound appeared rather smaller than the ma k in
the clothes, which would be accounted for by the fact that the flesh would
close a little after the knife had entered it.  In the portion of the flesh
round the stab a good deal of blood was extravasated into the tissues,
showing that the stabs were given when the deceased was alive.  The
blood was not merely round the surface of the wound, but was extensively
infiltrated round the wound.  The ribs below the portion in which
the stab to which I have referred was found were missing.  The bones
where the extremities joined were sawn, but great roughness was used
in separating parts of the bones.  The sawing, however, was very perfect,
showing that a very small sharp saw had been used.  The neck bones are 
all gone, and fourteen of the bones of the back are missing.  The cartilage 
has been cut through to disconnect them.  In examining the bones
I found they were of such large dimensions as to make me think, together
with the hair on the skin, that it was a male ; but on examining
the pelvis there was something inconsistent with the usual formation of a 
male pelvis.  I can entertain no reasonable doubt whatever that they were the
bones of a male.  I have measured the bones with my own, and I think
the deceased was a taller man than myself – say five feet eight inches.  I
also discovered some hair on the flesh – some belonged to the head, and
other portions to the whiskers, and the colour of both is dark.  I also
discovered some longer hairs, four of which, from the length and fineness, 
may be female hairs, but I do not think they belonged to the 
body fo the deceased person.  The short hairs are of the same colour as
those on the portions of skin which is attached to the bones.  I have no
doubt that the attempt to cut the body to pieces was not commenced
until after the rigidity of death had set in.  On fitting together
portions of the right leg I found the knee-joint and hip-joint
so strongly flexed that the leg must have lain with the thighbone 
at right angles.  The right arm was also strongly flexed, as if
pointing to the front of the body.  I do not think the decomposition in the
hip-joint could have set in under a week.  Why that portion should
have smelt strongly, and the other parts not, I cannot say, for all appeared
to have been immersed in brine.  I am certain, from the appearances of
the blood in the tissues, that the punctures in the chest must have been
given during life.  I should not be surprised, from the appearance of the
remains, if they had been boiled, as the ligaments showed a tightness
always observable in cases where flesh is boiled.  I cannot say whether
salt would have made the ligaments tight.  I have no hesitation
in saying the remains have not been used for anatomical purposes.
No person who had any anatomical knowledge would have gone
to work in such a roundabout fashion.  Moreover, the body could
only have been valuable for the bones, muscles, nerves, and arteries ;
and it is clear that the remains found never used for scientific
purposes.  The manner in which the flesh has been separated shows that ;
and the bones have been destroyed for anatomical purposes by the
manner in which they have been cut up.
Henry Errington, toll-collector at Waterloo-bridge, examined :  I was
on duty last Thursday night at half-past eleven o'clock, and remember
seeing a female coming up from the Strand to pass over the bridge.  She
placed a halfpenny on the iron plate, as persons generally do, and
attempted to drag the bag through.  She twisted it against the turnstile
and made it go round, and I said, "Why don't you ask somebody to lift
the bag up for you?  I have lost a halfpenny by the bag giving the stile a
turn."  I then took the bag up and laid it on the plate.  It had leather
handles and bottom, and a large flower on the side.  The bag produced is,
I have no doubt, the same bag which I lifted over the stile.  It weighed
from 20lb. to 30lb.  The female said something to me about why I did
not tell her the proper way to get through.  She had a black silk bonnet
and mantle, and her hair appeared to be matted down and powdered,
something like a footman's.  I remarked this particularly at the time.
I cannot say whether I should know her again, but if she were produced
in the same dress I might.  She spoke in a very gruff voice, which sounded
rather masculine.  She was about five feet three or four, short, and rather
stout.  She did not seem heated or distressed by the weight of the bag.
I thought she was going to catch the train from the Waterloo station,
which leaves at a quarter to twelve o'clock every night.
This being all the evidence tendered,
The Coroner, addressing the jury, said he did not propose to trouble
them with any further evidence that day.  The matter was at present in
the hands of the police for investigation, and the jury could not do better
than leave it with them.  He should, therefore, propose to adjourn the
inquiry for a fortnight, and at the expiration of that time the police
might be in possession of further evidence to throw light upon the case.
The jury then entered into the necessary recognisances to appear at the
adjourned inquest, and the inquiry was postponed until next Monday
week, at three o'clock.
The stabs through the clothes in the region of the heart are made longitudinally ;
and it would appear from other stabs in the shoulder and collar
of the coat that the deceased must have had a severe struggle with his

me. I hope I shall still be favored by you with one

10349 It is the only proof I can give you now of my 
attachment to you.

As my Seer will have a long sitting tomorrow Evening 
I will conclude - how am I to call the Spirit

appear. - then ask if it is the individual

assailants, and that he was struck indiscriminately before the wounds
were made in the left side, any one of which would appear to be sufficient
to account for death.
The clothes which are hung upon a line in one of the corridors of the
Bow-street station, have been examined by several persons who had lost
friends for whose safety they were anxious.  They consist of a light
outside coat, made of brown or pepper-and-salt coloured cloth, with black
silk buttons; a single-breasted frock-coat of fine black cloth, with a
label attached to the second button-hole below the collar--a somewhat
unusual appendage to a walking-coat; a black cloth waistcoat, more worn
than any other portion of the garments; a pair of grey coarse woollen
trousers, cut in French fashion; a longcloth shirt with linen front and
wristbands; a pair of thick merino drawers, with one metal button in
front; and a pair of coarse cotton socks made of thread and very much
worn at the upper part of the sole.  The socks, it is hoped, will prove an
important agent in the detection of the murderers. They are of peculiar 
make and material, being hand-knitted, and composed of coarse thread,
ribbed.
The clothes have been pronounced by competent authorities to be of
foreign make--either French or Belgian, and made to order, from the
fact of their being of a style and workmanship superior to those of ready-made
or slop articles.
Two human heads found in Sussex-gardens were brought to the Bow-street
police-station on Monday evening and submitted to a medical examination.  
The result went to show that they have no connection whatever
with the remains found at Waterloo-bridge, and that they were 
probably buried in the place in which they were found by some persons
who had used them for anatomical purposes, as they bear the marks of
having been operated upon by a surgeon.  One of the heads is that of a 
man, and is quite hard and withered; the other is that of a female, with
red hair appended.
As an instance of the completeness and rapidity with which the metropolitan 
police can be set in motion it may be stated that, immediately on
the discovery of the bones, information, giving  description of the bag and
its contents, was sent to every division; and that in less than three hours
the printed "informations" of the police were in the hands of the whole 
metropolitan force.
Government has offered a reward of £200 for the discovery of the supposed 
murderer, and £100 for the discovery of the person who placed the
carpet-bag in the position where it was found; with a free pardon to any
accomplice not being the actual murder.

that I am pleased that I have an
opportunity of meeting him I will not
stay to detain you.

33' Invoked Ellesmo
Ellesmo appeared as usual
My friend Mr Lea is now here agreeable to your
appointment -- and we shall be most happy to
receive your promised Communication -- as I have
obtained the CA's permission to receive it in this Mirror
10358 I thank you
The short works that I give him
are to serve instead of a multitude
35

questions & answers that might [?] on 
religious subjects, I thought it best to give 
them in this way because he could have 
them in a compact form and refer to them 
at any time and weigh their contents at his 
leisure.

My Seer is still very unwell & speaks with difficulty 
we shall be obliged by your work coming slowly 

10359 I am desirous of doing so 
I am scarcely acquainted with the niceties 
of this mode of Communication but when 
you mention to me it is coming too fast 
I will stop it for a time.

I thank you.

Eltesmo held the book in his hand which appeared 
only as a few sheets of paper

It has got a large title with a plain white 
fly leaf the title in large letters - with something 
like a verse under the title - thus

10360 "The Practical Laws of Life 
" and the rewards which obedience to them 
" ensures to the Soul

"Whosoever therefore breaks of the least 
"commandments. or teaches men to do he shall 
"be the least in the Kingdom of Heaven - 
"But whosoever do and teach them the 
"same shall be great in the Kingdom of 
"Heaven. Matthew 5 Chapter & 19 Verse.

"Being sincerely convinced through faith 
"of the Divinity of Christ - &c."
36

As my Seer was suffering from sore throat I explained 
that we would receive the rest at another sitting 
prior to his next appointment of the 6th April.

10361 A [?] work will be given then.

There is not a very great deal remaining 
but still if you cannot receive it this Evening 
Mr Lea can finish it at his house. or hear if 
that is not convenient on another Evening 
soon. - there is not sufficient to occupy 
a whole Evening - I think 3/4 of an hour 
would conclude it.

Will next Friday week suit your convenience

10362 I would rather do so before that time

Will you favor me with it, and I will send a copy 
to Mr Lea.

10363 being his Guardian Spirit my address is 
necessarily directed to him personally altho 
I am quite willing to give you my opinion 
or experience on any thing I would rather 
furnish this directly to him

Will you give it to him then in your own mirror 
his wife Mrs. Lea being [speculatrix?]

10364 She would not be able to do so

Will you then please to appear on Friday next

10365 Either on Friday or the two following days 
I would willingly appear

We will then say Friday with your kind consent 
We were discussing on the matter when Eltesmo said

10366 I can hear you speak

Mr Lea returned thanks and hoped our being 
unable to finish would not ocasion the loss of 
any portion.

10367 It will not 
It will be most convenient to me to begin 
at the usual time 1/2 past 7 or 8

10368 I thank you very much for allowing 
me the opportunity of communicating this 
[?] with my charge.

Invoked Eltesmo

Eltesmo appeared directly with the book which at 
my request slowly opened & my Seer completed it 
at 8 PM.

May I observe that on being unfortunately prevented 
by my Seer's health. from obtaining your first work 
may I ask if we can have it at a future time

10369 I cannot being a work on any other day

May I ask then if the book is a "Spiritual Entity" 
existing in the Spirit World. or is it only the 
temporary Embodiment of your mind & consequently lost 

10370 It is not lost to me

May I ask the title of the first work we thus missed

10371 The Book of Spiritual Intelligence

What title shall we give to the book we received 
of you before this

10372 I had no title for it - It was but the thoughts 
drawn from my knowledge, while this 
last I had given you is in substance 
the Commandments of Christ for Christian 
living

You kindly promised Mr Lea a seal for the Vacant 
Corner of his Mirror will you favor us with it now

10373 Yes

26' past 8 my Seer received the Seal.

Mr. T. & Mrs. L. had a long Conference in which she

wished Mr G to see. her nephew personally that
he ought be Satisfied—& not by worrying himself
about her disposal of her property  keep her from
progressing on to happiness — which Mr G promised
to do.

THE WATERLOO BRIDGE MYSTERY

TO THE EDITOR OF "THE DAILY TELEGRAPH."
SIR—While passing time has almost caused the 
Waterloo Bridge mystery to be forgotten, even on the 
immediate scene of its occurrence, information has gradually
been collected at a place distant from it by thousands of
miles. Through that extraordinary freemasonry existing
among criminals who from time to time recruit our convict
class—men bound together by the war of society against
them, and leagued in fidelity to each other by an acquaintance
with or participation in each other's crimes—there
can be no doubt there were those at the time in London
who, if not privy to that murder in its inception, very
soon after the commission of the crime knew the particulars
of it, and could, if they would, have solved the
mystery.
   Without further preface, I will quote an extract from 
a letter received by B—, a gentleman well known in
this city, from his brother, at present in Tasmania, and
holding there a highly-respectable social position, and her
Majesty's Commission of the Peace, referring to a Mr. 
R—, the subject of the tragedy which it is believed has
been enacted. He writes:
   "I feel convinced that his (R—'s,' was the body
found in the carpet-bag under Waterloo Bridge. From
what I have heard from a  person lately come out, it
appears R— was lodging with a Jew named W—,
a returned convict, close to Waterloo Bridge at the
time that he had about £1,400 worth of Tasmanian
debentures, which for some time he had been 
endeavouring to sell; that he sold them to a 
respectable Jew named N—; that he received the money,
and the same day went home to his lodgings, and
is supposed to have had his money with him, from which
house he has never been seen or heard of ; and when Mr.
S—, a friend of his, went to his lodgings a few days
after, he could get no tidings whatever of R—, and the
wretch W— had fled no one knew where. I have no
doubt he knew R— had the money, then murdered
him, cut him up, put portions of the body, (the head never
was found) into the carpet bag, and threw it into the 
river. Not a paper, not a vestige of anything belonging
to him has since turned up, and I have no more doubt
that that was his fate than that I am writing this. We
have ascertained that the man W— is dead . . . . .
Mrs. R— is still very unsettled. I told her of my suspicions,
but still she hopes on. She says she would know
the carpet bag he took with him. No doubt the police
have got it. Would it be possible to obtain it, and any
other articles connected with it, and have them sent out
here for her to see them?"
   A very few words in further explanation will be sufficient.
B—, above referred to, the recipient of the communication
from Tasmania, and at present in Dublin, was
himself a resident of Tasmania some years ago, and while
there met R—, and knew him intimately ; he was then
a person of some property, and holding a respectable 
position in life. R— came to Ireland some time previous to
the Waterloo Bridge event, and soon after called on
B—, who at the time happened to be from home, and
did not see him, nor afterwards during his stay in Dublin
did they chance to meet ; but R—'s arrival in Dublin
from Tasmania at that time, however, is confirmed from his
having called on others here as well as B—. From Dublin
R— proceeded to Belfast, where he had business to 
transact ; thence he proceeded to London, where he was
also known to have arrived safely, and was called on there
by a Mr. S— (to whom, it appears, he was also in some
way known), a few days after the finding of the carpet- bag
with the remains at Waterloo Bridge, with the result
stated in the Tasmania letter.

R— was somewhat eccentric, and, though possessed 
of considerable means, his habits were frugal
and saving, if not penurious. It is by no means impossible
he may have known the convict W— when
that man was the denizen of a penal settlement ; 
perhaps he looked upon him as a "reformed criminal,"
and as more to be encouraged and relied upon than one
who has all along led an honest life. R— was known to
very few in London. I am not aware, indeed, that he 
was known to anyone there, except Mr. S—, who called 
upon him. His stay there was to be brief. In that
crowded hive it may have seemed immaterial to him where
he stopped for the time, provided his expenses were small.
In any case, it has been ascertained by those in Tasmania
who knew him that he lodged with this returned convict
close to Waterloo Bridge at the time referred to, and has
never since been heard of—he, together with the proceeds
of his sale of Tasmanian debenture, having alike
disappeared—neither have the mutilated fragments of the
human body found in the carpet-bag been ever since
accounted for in any way the least satisfactory or credible.
That it was the means adopted by some anatomist to get
rid of human remains upon which he had been 
practising—the suggestion accepted at the time when the
police failed to make any discovery—was not only 
exceedingly improbable, being so different from what is
customarily done in such cases, but was altogether 
inconsistent with the mangled—and not anatomised—appearance
which the remains presented.
   Had the information now possessed been at hand—had
Mr. S— known the description of person with whom
R— had gone to lodge, his disappearance at that
particular time might have suggested some inquiry ; but an
idea that such was his fate could not for a moment have 
entered S—'s mind, otherwise he would have acted upon
it. R— coming over to this country, not to remain, but
merely to transact some business and return, and moving
from Dublin to Belfast, and from Belfast to London, the
natural inference, on not finding him at his lodgings, was,
that he had finished his business in London, and gone
elsewhere ; that he had perhaps returned to Tasmania.
Even his known eccentricity was calculated 
to make his disappearance less remarkable.
   Have the London police information whether a 
returned convict (a Jew, named W—) was, immediately
preceding the event, residing close to Waterloo Bridge?
Do they know at what time he left that locality, and are
they able to trace his subsequent career? Possibly it may
not fall within their province to look after such characters.
Having graduated in a penal settlement, they may,
on their return, be regarded as fully entitled to exemplify
their matured experience upon society, unchecked by
any unwelcome supervision. Did the London detective
staff, at the time of the occurrence, discover that a 
gentleman had been lodging with that convict and that he
suddenly and unaccountably disappeared? Did they 
discover that that gentleman had previously sold Tasmanian
debentures to a large amount to another Jew, and been
paid for them ? Could they ascertain in what moneys
those were paid for, and through what channels they or 
any of them subsequently passed? Difficulties apparently
greater than any that such an inquiry presents have been
surmounted where skill has accompanied a desire to arrive
at the truth. I am prepared to give the names of all the
parties represented by initials in this communication, to
any person competent or having authority to investigate
the matter further. —I am, Sir, yours &c.,
GEORGE IRWIN.

THE WATERLOO BRIDGE MYSTERY

TO THE EDITOR OF "THE DAILY TELEGRAPH."
SIR—The letter of your correspondent, signed George
Irwin, will be read with astonishment by those who were
horrified some few years back by the atrocious murder
which will for ever be known by the above title. There
cannot be any doubt but that a fearful murder was committed,
although the police tried their utmost to fix it upon the
shoulders of medical students who had endeavoured to
practise upon the credulous a joke which in itself would
have been too disgusting and revolting a character
for medical students to attempt. I very much regret this
report was put forward, as I feel convinced it was the
means of stopping many inquiries which might have been
made. I do not take upon myself to assert that the
police had the slightest faith in their own report ; in fact,
I know well they were convinced to the contrary by
several anatomical opinions, based upon such scientific
principles as left the matter beyond a doubt. I 
remember perfectly all the minutiae connected with the
fearful contents of the carpet-bag. I fully explained to
the police authorities present the perfect impossibility of
the wounds having been inflicted after death, the 
infiltration of the tissues, and the cuts upon the garments
being saturated with arterial blood, which could have
emanated only from wounds made upon a living subject.
The more immediate cause of my thus trespassing upon
your time is to corroborate, to some extent, the letter of
George Irwin. It may be remembered perhaps by those
to whom I made the remark, that the stockings of the
murdered man were foreign, and, like those worn in the
colonies, they were of a very coarse texture, knitted by
hand—these, as also the other articles of wearing apparel,
belonging more probably to an emigrant than a student. 
I had also incontestable proofs that the deceased was a
very dark man. I look forward with anxiety, and trust
that the police will not lose sight of the facts now made
public by your correspondent George Irwin. —I am, Sir,
yours, &c.,
A. H. H.

THE WATERLOO BRIDGE MYSTERY.
[*1 Dec'r / 64*]

   Seven years have elapsed since a startling
announcement was made that a horrible murder had been
committed in London, and that an attempt had been made
to conceal it under circumstances of an unusual
character. It was said that some boys who were out in a 
boat on the Thames had found on one of the abutments
on the western side of Waterloo Bridge a bag which
contained the bones of a human being with a suit of
clothes which, when examined, led to the conclusion
that a man moving in a respectable sphere of life had
been barbarously murdered, his body roughly hewn to
pieces by unprofessional hands, and the bag containing
the bones let down over the parapet of the
bridge with the intention that they should
sink in the river and be no more heard of. The
bag instead of going into the water rested upon the
abutments and was so found by the boys, who handed it
over to the police. Various rumours were in circulation
at the time in reference to persons who had been seen
on the bridge, and who were suspected of having
dropped the bag, but nothing conclusive was ascertained,
and the matter at length subsided, although
the most diligent inquiries had been made by the police.
Last August, the subject was revived by a letter which
was published in some of the papers from Mr. Irwin, of
Dublin, who gave the initial letters of the names of
four persons who, as he imagined, were implicated in
the matter, three of them being suspected of making
away with the fourth, who had mysteriously
disappeared under circumstances which he very fully and
somewhat plausibly detailed. Application was made to

the authorities at Scotland Yard that the bag in which
the bones had been deposited and the clothing might be
sent to Victoria, Australia, in order that the wife of the
missing man might see them, with a view, if possible,
to their identification as the property of her husband.
That request, however, could not be complied with in
the face of stringent police regulations. It was also
considered that the description would be sufficient to
serve most purposes, and that if the articles were
identified the detective officers might be instructed to
bring over any person whose evidence they might
suppose would tend to further more detailed inquiries.
To make the matter perfectly clear, it may
be mentioned that Mr. Irwin, in his letter, expressed
his conviction that the supposed victim was a man
named R——, who had gone out from England to
Australia some time prior to the occurrence, and had
amassed a large sum of money. He left his wife and
child in Australia and came back to England, bringing
with him securities of the value of 1,400£., for which he
received the money. At that time he was living in
the house of one W——, in a street leading out of the
Strand, not far from Waterloo Bridge. R—— remained
there a short time, and all at once he disappeared,
and this was about the date of the finding of the
bag of bones and clothes. Mr. Irwin's letter also
referred to parties with the initials S—— and N—— as
having had something to do with the monetary transactions
of R——. The circumstantial character of Mr.
Irwin's allegations necessitated in the minds of the
authorities in the direction pointed out, and the matter
was entrusted for investigation to one of the most
experienced officers of the detective force. The officer
ascertained in the first place that just antecedent to
the time of the discovery a man, named Woolfe,
lived at 15, Arundel street, Strand, which was
then a private hotel ; and about that time a 
person of the name of Ratcliffe came there
to see him. Ratcliffe remained at the hotel as a 
resident for a few days, and while there Woolfe took
the house No. 30 in the same street. During this period
of their acquaintanceship Ratcliffe told Woolfe that he
had some Tasmanian debenture bonds upon which he
was to receive the interest in the City, and that he
wished to turn the bonds into money. It appears that
Woolfe himself did not want to buy them, but he
introduced Ratcliffe to a man of the name of Sinnett, who
was understood to be a dealer in securities and bills, but
he did not require them, and he in his turn introduced
Ratcliffe to one Nathan, who purchased the bonds, 
paying the amount in Bank of England notes to Ratcliffe,
who almost immediately afterwards disappeared,
no one knowing what had become of him. Three months
later, however, as the detective officer has since 
ascertained, Ratcliffe opened an account with the Commercial
Banking Company, at Liverpool, and deposited a
considerable sum of money, doubtless the produce of the
sale of the bonds ; and after a short interval he withdrew
his balance, for the purpose, as he stated, of going
to America. From that day to the present nothing
further is known of him. The identity of the man
Ratcliffe, who lived with Woolfe, in Arunderl-street,
and who was imagined by Mr. Irwin to be
the victim of the Waterloo Bridge tragedy, with 
the man Ratcliffe, who three months afterwards
was at Liverpool, was proved by a comparison of the
signature on the Tasmania bonds with that on the
books of the Commercial Banking Company. It has
also been ascertained that Woolfe, having left England
for Australia, died in that colony about three years
since. The result of this investigation entirely puts an
end to the grave suspicions which Mr. Irwin's letter
not unnaturally raised, and leaves still undiscovered
the perpetrators of a crime which, at the time, created
a profound sensation in the public mind.

When did I die   I cant remember the
date but it was a fortnight before any
thing was [found] heard by the public
that I came over in the boat from
Calais this voyage had been no
better than my former was . I had
been sent over to Belgium by a
Gentleman who frequents a very notorious
house in St James' Street. to fetch

been in London some months before
I was provided with clothes Suff't.

And money enough to make my
Entrance Easy to the places I was
obliged to follow her in — She was of
very good station—
    I won't trouble you with
what I did or the means I resorted to
but I succeeded & came over on the
boat from Calais and landed at [dover?]
Early on the Evening of the day that
was my last I went Straight up
to London got into a Cab and rode to
St James's St.   I then had with me
the bag that was found _ a black
bag that was taken away from Engl'd.
with me belonging to myself and
there was some luggage of hers
I took her into the house where
the Gentleman was writing for her
and he paid me the Sum that
was agreed upon — the room was
not very light he had on a cloak
and I had a coat with very large
Sleeves , and whilst he was giving
me the money I extracted his watch
and made off with it to Sloane St.
    I had not been gone long before
he discovered it and a man belong'g.
to the house followed me , he must
have done so. — I found some one
dodging me and instead of turning
down the [?]. I passed it and came
back again and then Seeing no
one about I entered the house and
went , after seeing the woman Mrs. Davis,
into the workshop under ground

two bags in my hand _ David Isaacs
and two girls and Another man
were there ._ Morris — Iam Morris

I don't know what business they had
there at the time . the furnace was

    Mrs. Davis followed me down. &
her first words were has he paid you
I threw the watch down on the table

no, he hadn't ready money Enough

called immediately for me, it was

back by the man threatening to
expose the whole affair , if I was
54

10433
taken into Custody and saying it wd.
be much better that he sh'd say no
more about it but let me keep it
but still I was afraid that in his rage
he might take steps to recover it , so I
offered the man 10[?] if he would bring
me the answer to the note back again
as quickly possible — I had not
yet had time to take off my coat
I said that
and she drew from it of course that
I had the money besides the watch
when I went into the Kitchen or rather
the workshop for it served all
purposes   she accused me loudly of
having the money and wanting to
keep it from them   I denied it &
high words followed — however they
cooled down surprisingly, they
seemed very smooth to me' and
it passed off in a few minutes, in
the heat of my passion I had
said I had the money & more too
in the bag and that seemed to calm
them , they had an old canvass

tarred hung upon one side of the
furnace when I first went into the
room. when I went back again
this Canvass was on the floor with
the Edge turned up ag't the furnace
I stood upon it close to the fire
and the woman asked me if I wd.
not take something — I said yes
and the woman gave me something

my mouth full.  my face towards
the copper and my back to David
Isaacs when I felt a stab in my
shoulder, my first effort was to scream
that I could not fully on account
of the food in my mouth and when
I attempted the man lifted me up
by the back of the neck.  and turned
me face downwards into the boiling
water and so I was partially smothered
but I did not die until the third
stab entered my ribs, those minutes
I suffered [?].
    I fell upon the canvass that
was placed there on purpose and
then they began their work of
cutting up.  for a fortnight I was
picked and hacked about, they did
not know how to get rid of me
-- but there is no occasion for me
to say how they cut me up  what 
passed then seems to me now but
a remembered dream, whilst I was
laying partly dissected in a tub
of salt in that room the men
destroyed as much as possible  the
coining utensils and every thing that
could lead to their apprehension for
that offense.  and then David and
the woman being prepared [?]
flight and all traces of the deed 
being destroyed my flesh burnt in
the furnace and the bones packed
in my bag, the house being put

Quite in order David and the woman

parcel with the hands feet and head
in and she the heavier but less
fearful   perhaps of the bones  they
went by different ways to Waterloo

parcel  and the bag. The string she
lowered the body with was some I

went to Waterloo Station and left for

went over to Guernsey and soon after
landing the woman destroyed herself

had nothing to do in nay way with
my death altho he was partly the
Cause unknowingly , but he was not
implicated and the woman I brought
over with me , who was the only one
that could have identified me at
the time was discarded by him
Shortly afterwards , took to the streets
for a living and a short time since
died in the London Hospital.

LA Mirror 
♀die Jan 22 1858 
Presents MacKenzie 
As my Seer was unwell I placed the Mirror on the 
Tue Serem [?] near the fue [?] & I looked the L.A.—but the 
Mirror not replying [?] or any response being made—upon 
which I placed it as usual ago the Wall & 
10434 
I looked the L.A. 
May I ask if the position of the Mirror Prevented my 
having the req responses. 
10435 
It was new to me, when we are associated 
intimately with one custom we cannot 
discontinue it without an Effort. 
I thank you.—as Dr Mackenzie has formed one with a 
Vision this Evening to meet Seven Omnia—I will with 
your permission call him—but I called you first that 
the Evg might be under your influence 
10436 
You received that communication last 
Tuesday. 
I did it was most Canons next Tuesday I will make 
Some Remain Vis upon it. 
10437 
You can easily underplayed now why 
he does not using be in his present 
State with the Spirits of a high Caste 
If any de 
10438 
I have not. 
She Ca left. 
8 PM.  
I woked Seven Omina 
som is here as usual. 
this is the ever you kindly appointed to meet a LM 
he is now here—my I ask if you have any 
Communication to make to him 
10439 
I will answer his Questions. 
P.M. Asked if som had any Special Comm” to make 
58 
10440 
I was desirous of Seeing you, if having 
an interview that are bond of mirror 
might as much as possible be 
Strengthened and made fast 
Kill will you Kindly. Rs impregnate Seal. 
10441 
I will 
away of right then came down & touched the Seal 
GS oid Said 
10442 
It is done. 
If there is no positive end arrived at 
by over conversation. itself still from the 
meeting of one ideas & the interchange 
of thought. we are cemented by a tie 
that the unknown., unseen. and to 
you threatening Circumstances cannot 
Sever. 
KM. Is my talisman still useful 
10443 
Yes Continue to wear it 
PM., asked Som. as to his faculty of Seeing & when 
it would become developed. 
10444 
To what state of Seership you may 
Ultimately attain depends on agt 
measure upon yourself, it is being 
developed. the changes & uncertainties 
Are occasioned by your own Circumstances 
I mean being unable to pursue it 
Steadily is adhere to one course 
firmly or have you mind fixed upon 
the Subject you are desirous to grasp 
or that events put you in a tramatious [?] 
State of feeling when the greatest calm 
is necessary. for its progression— 
—If you can overcome these feelings 
you must. and having Set apart 
a time fore your investigation free 

59

Yourself entirely from all business
matters and give your exclusive attentn.
to your stdy. do it methodically
at the stated intervals and do it
earnestly and then being in a fit
state the senses unimpaired you will
succeed but not else.

KM. as to advice on worldly movements.

10445
I cannot advise for the best.

KM. as to his future wife S.O.M.'s co-charge til
she also possesed the sight

10446  
She has not.

KM. as to the book on astrology

10447
I can give it when I have sufficient
time without interuption to do so.

KM. You proposed that I should lecture on Spirit."
Is it not time to collect materials.

10448
I think it advisable that you shd.
collect the materials for it You must
read the works lately published
on it - so as to be able to refute
their doctrines for they are all either
Evil or absurd -
You must substitute a true
theory for their false one. all the
works lately published are alike
there is not that I know of amongst
them one that can stand the test
of light

KM. my friend the Revd Mr W said he did not
believe in the doctrine of Atonement by vicarial
Sacrifice - will you explain that doctrine to me.

10449
First on what grounds does he 
disbelieve

KM he did not tell me
[notation] KM. So much difficultly exists in reference to the 
doctrine of the atonement Will you kindly
explain it in such a way as to satisfy the
intellect of man.
[notation] 60
10450
It seems scarcely possible to me that
a man can believe in the death of
Christ having intellect, refusing to
believe in the death of Christ having 
merit with GOD. Sufficient to procure
the boon for which he died , I wanted 
to know if he believed in the divinity
of Christ.

KM. That I believe he does.— Swedenborgs view of it—
10451
Because if you believe him to be
divine come by miraculous means
for a special purpose. with the Spirit
of GOD. made men by its conjunction
with flesh. You cannot believe that
His words would be ought but
inspired but being inspired by the
being from whom he came. every
word that came from his mouth
must be perfect truth., and if all
his words are perfect truth. what is
the meaning of that part often repeated
that he dies to save man ?

KM. Referred to the [?] Angels Remarks on
Sacrifice
10452
I do not think it a Sacrifice in the
Common Acceptation of the team —
his whole life was a sacrifice to man
And his death was a greater one
for he went through Sufferings
feeling them so acutely that the
body [Shrank] Sank under them
with a resolution and firmness that
was never shaken — because he
deemed it to be his duty necessary for
the furtherance of his Cause. He
61
Sacrificed himself for the sake of the world
but the flesh and blood of his body was
not for a moment contemplated by him as
being acceptable to GOD.
KM. the soul after death seems to be incorporated
with the G.S. do we retain individuality after
death or how do we in Eternal life attain
happiness.
10453
the individuality of the person as he
Appears upon the Earth and is known to
others is gradually lost as he changes
his feelings , desires , faith & aspirations
and his form becomes clothed with the
sentiments of his Spiritual invisible
body but as he loses his material
appearance he gradually Assumes a shape
by which he is recognized and which
remains to him invaluable for Ever
and it is not until after he has
progressed to a certan state that the
GS. is united to him., he accompanies
him upward if necessary is inseparable
from him , he doe snot become one with
him until he final close of all
Spiritual progression when the bar of
Judgment has been passed and one set
of beings the late mortal as I
as the spirit from Eternity is as capable
as he of Enjoying the [?] happiness
provided.
KM. If any remark as to the final Close fo Spiritual
progression
10454
My Serious thoughts arrived at after
much reflection gathered from the
concurrent Circumstances that are and
62
and have taken place Around are cannot
be given in a few lines I have Sought
deeply and inquired much. and the [?]
of it is the Conviction that the events that
fill up that space of imeasurable 
distances unlimited length is such that
the imagination even of Angels cannot
picture it unaided by Evidence drawn
from external objects and if they cannot
do this who livE and movE in the same
Space and are [?] taking now of pure
Spiritual existence how much less shall
the mind of man fathom its [?]
chained as he is in the prison house
of the flesh.
KM. AS to the personal history of S.oM.
10455
No Answer.
KM. We mortals find it difficult to understand how
you Spirits can be disembodied inteligencies
living and yet without organization, can you
explain this too us for while you say that the
brilliant visions that you Sometimes show have
no positive existence for Sight, You still speak
of the Scenery of the Spheres , I know my
Question is obscene but I know not how better
to express it.
10456
Cannot you imagine the embodiment
of intelligence without matter when you
close the Senses of the body to all.
external impressions and wander withouht
to the Ends of the Earth to the bottom
of an imaginary Receptacle for sin or
Sign upwards to the footsteps of the 
throne in Communion with your maker
Are not your ideas as clear , Your

as [acute?] as though you had no [form?]
or can you tell [tiarelling?] thus far

And as it is with that mind that

from being ought but the embodiment
of ideas
Are there any persons who have no [GSs?].
because one might think So by SOM's remarks
"One cannot for a moment feel that any other
beings however near to him in purity and
goodness or however far in darkness and Sin
Can be absolutely necessary to keep up an
Action that he has begun" SOM's remarks in
reference to a passage on [?]
There are beings who have So low
as to be attended by Evil Spirits, when
Such is the Case the good one flees
When the man makes his Choice
between the two presented to him in
the two [?] of life - the
Cannot have any further influence and
it is of no use fighting individually
with the Spirit that besets him of Evil
but as every Child is born without Sin
So every Child [naturally?] is endowed
with a guardian Spirit, but when his
own responsibility is felt by him and he
Chooses knowingly a wicked life and
falls into the Snares of his Enemy
64
the only Enemies that man has he
makes himself Answerable in the Sight
of GOD. for the loss of he fine influence
that might havE been his for life —
What a fearful hateful doctrine that
is which some men Among you hold
of Children being born to perdition unless
Saved by Some special intercession—
As though one life was not as dear to
the Creator as another , as though He
did not do his share towards promoting
the Eternal happiness of Each so long
as he was not repulsed by their bodily
Resistance
KM. for the natural world does free will occupy
the primary rank And is it sufficiently powerful
to over come all that spirits desire and advise
And is there not in the spirit world a similar
free will able to control by its superior force
the will of man. — as is Shown in this world
by Mesmerism and cognate phenomena.
10458
You make a Muddle there the free will
of Man carries him through everything
[????fluenced] — Mesmerism and all other
States in which he loses his Consciousness
he gives himself up to the influence of
others and so destroys his free will by
a voluntary Act. which therefore no longer
exists. but so long as he retains it
by his Strength of mind and [?] of
purpose All the spirits of the [?]
cannot rob him of it. for it is the special
gift of a GOD. Kept inviolate from all
intrusion and from that he is able if
65

he determines to surmount every obstacle
that sin places in his path. but whilst
he has the strength. to conquer he has
the power to be subdued if his will
flags in his duty.

KM When a Vision takes place in a [C] or [M] before
it is charged is any Spirit invoked in it in
what light are we to regard that vision as to
truthfulness and does such [C] or [M] always
afford to those who can see a vision of a portion
of the Spiritual World or Atmosphere on Earth.

10459
You have put two questions in one I
can answer them separately
No reliance can be placed upon those
visions which appear spontaneously, but
at the same time they may lead to good
results for the interest of the party inspectg.
may be involved in disclosure, that
could not otherwise come about. so that
they must be taken guardedly and
with care and exorcism. after being exorcised
the narrative or vision may be attended
to or looked at - and treated according[ly]
to your judgment
The Second question I can 
Scarcely answer so well. for from its
appearance you will most probably be
able to tell in what place the Scene
takes place whether the Earth the
Atmosphere or a higher place or whether
the party appearing may be living
dead or Spirit

KM. If any advice &c. and as to guarding his Mirror
from Evil Influences.

10460
It is almost superflous for me to say

66

that I guard you and that because
my desire for this interview tests it
better than words and that I shall be
able to continue this guardianship
satisfactorily is a prayer and a wish
that finds the first place in my mind

I returned thanks for Dr M. I myself. &c

10461
I thank you

C. A Mirror
[symbol for Mars] 2 Feb. 1858  Invoked the CA.
5' to 8 PM
My Seer was too unwell to inspect on last Tuesday
Evg. I hope it will not prevent our Recg the Commn.
promised for that Evening

10462
It will not

May we receive the explanation of the Vision this
Evening

10463
I am not prepared with it this Evening

Shall we be able to receive Either that or Your concluding
book next Tuesday Evning

10464
I will give Either the one or the other

I explained at length as to Mrs. Legge. ( ) and
asked if it were possible that the Mind of the
living nephew could prevent or rather retard here
Spiritual progress.

10465
Such is the case when the deceased party
has allowed one desire for money and
over anxiety respecting it in all their
dealings to fill up their Earthly lives
and take the place that should be
Assigned to different purposes in their
Minds, they die with these all
engrossing thoughts Still within them
67
And it appears to them when materiality
is far below in a State of being , and if
another person having had connection
with them in the world associates his
thoughts and desires to them unites
himself to them by congeniality of tastes
and with them having a mutual
desire for the possession of wealth. the
Connection is there Continued and so the
one alive influences the dead. And the
one dead can influence the living
     Many cases have taken place in
which deceased parties have frightened
the heir from the possession of property
which they  had they lived would have
inherited,  because in idea  they grasp it
in imagination  they are personally present
in possession   and to him who is the
sole obstacle between them and their
imaginary object   they present themselves
by their fixed and intense desire .-- will -
we should call it in Man for it is
the same property which he then has
as an attribute of his Nature.

Is there any way in which her spirituall progress
Could be accelerated by relieving her from the [?] of
his thoughts

10466   Her condition depends more upon herself
then upon him — if she carried her
mind[s] to things above her  she would
be free of his Memory — he would not be
able to molest her, but while she too
turns her attention to things of the
Earth. her Spirit adheres to his and
his to her.
68

some years since before I knew her by sight she
often appeared uncalled in my crystal  may
I ask the reason of her & others appearing in my
crystal uncalled

10467    Such appearances as those are occasioned
by very slight circumstances occurring
at the time  It may be that she was
near your atmospheric spirit or that
the thought of her might have been
in someones mind present or Mr. T. may
have been near her and then near you
     A secret influence is at work even
in such slight things as that  that
neither meets the eye nor the comprehension
of a man.  

I remarked as to some discrepancies in the Spirits stat't
as to his [?] [?] [?] St "[?]" -- the woman diing
in London Hospital  so soon  after her introduction to
the party &c.

104608   I do not know his statement  I do not
wish to know it -- It was the spirit of
the party who appeared   I know because
spirits that have been near to him
have informed me of it.  he is a foreigner
you are aware  and his communication
was made plain by the spirit of the
Mirror
     That spirit knows that Communicat'n
throughout from translating it therefore
you could speak to him about it

I wd [?] the  opportunity -- Can I do so this
Evening.

10469   Yes

My Seers health has delayed us much in carrying
out P de C.  The Spanish Monks wishes in reference
69
reference to his MF. I hope it does not distress
him.
10470
[?] be glad When you havE finished
it.
You were kind Enough to promise my Seer a
[?] to prevEnt her Seeing spirits [whe] except
when Engaged with My Mirror
10471
I cannot this Evening I am not prepared
with it there is not one existing that can
exactly met the purpose for which it
is required.
I explained the Sect of Thuggee. and then
Sacrifices to [Bh??ance] havE you Ever heard
of that. sect.
10472
I know of all the Sacrifices that are
made to these images of a GOD.
And I havE also heard fo the Especial
band of Robbers taht you havE mentd.
for I believe taht their Religion was but
a Cloak the better to hide then [?]
villainy and they were but one amongst
the many gangs taht exist all over
the Earth.
But in Hundustan they are numbered by thousands
10473
And in the Uncivilized parts of America
there are bodies of men who carry on
the [S??ine] trade. — In China What sacrifice
Are made for the Sake of Robbing a Victim
but the murdered Come to us Sinless
And unanswerable for their [Sins] offenses
the Murderers heavily laden with their
own and the murdered ones Sins.
I explained the difference between Thuggee & the
hostilities between the various holies of North American
Indians
70

10474    They commit the murder for the sake of
the robbery not for the sake of the sacrifice
to their goddess   And those I have spoken
of in the uncultivated parts of America
are of different tribes  one tribe having
Enmity towards another and so
murdering its people by vow.  for these
men though uneducated have reason
And according to that a devotional feeling
towards a particular object.  and if their
language cannot be understood it is
systematic and one of the same tribe
understands  the speech and they can
plot and advise and adhere to each others
instructions  as well as civilized beings
And they Estimate human life cheaply
the blood of the enemy is sweet to
them   and what he possesses  even if it
be but the produce of his labor in collecting
food fruits  animals  of the forest  or
ought else it [is sufficiently]  it is
sufficiently valuable to be coveted by 
others.  who are desirous of obtaining it
without using the means.

If any &c

10475   I have nothing this Evening
The C A left  5' to 9.

9 PM.          Called Mr Anderson
Mr Anderson is here

10476   I can appear this Evening but I think
it will be the last before I get home

Are you then about returning to England

10477   Not yet  I anticipate doing so before
71

the Summer comes  but if I can appear
I will

I hope you have got well of your wound

10478    It has not quite disappeared yet

I presume the mutiny is now in a fair way of being
suppressed  except in Oude

10479    They are centred there now  so that it leaves
us for the present idle  but then if they
are routed from one part they take up a position
in another  they will be some time chasing
them about there.
     I want to go more into the interior of
India before I return if I can possibly do
it  I am anxious to see some of the 
places

I have often wished to see [?] Elephanta - & still
more to witness some of the magical feats of the
Natives

10480     I have heard about it from some residents
here.  I know that the names of their
GODs and Goddesses are used in a kind of
incantation  whether it is efficient or not
is a question -- whether they do it as a
kind of preamble to make it seem more
mysterious or whether they really believe
in appealing to them.  I dont know  but
if they do appeal to them I should think
it was useless  for those horrid ugly stone
& wood statues cannot have power of
interfering

Certainly the idols have no power Except as theyre present
Spirits of Evil -- when a Catholic holds his Crucifix
up & prays - he doesn't suppose the image can
assist him --

10481     how do they get hold of the names they
[Cluster?] their idols with
Your question's about the names of all their idols have 
a determinate meaning the same as scripture proper 
names.

10482 
I imagined these names must exist in 
a book which has been through their 
generations as our bible in ours

Of course what else are their Sacred Sanscrit & [?]
works the Vedas

10485
But there must be one book amongst 
them that must be known even to 
the commonest because they all worship 
the image named by one with the same 
devotion and if such a name arose 
from any magical MS or any thing 
else that was only in possession of a few 
the mass would not worship it.
   I am very desirous to know from
what those names originated because I
want to know of the Spirits they are
intended to represent.

I have just finished reading Captain Meadows 
Taylor Confessions of a Thug

10484
I have read it -- but it is suppressed 
Now altho I should not like to [?]
in many parts. -- but a great many 
would cease to carry it in for fear of
discovery since active measures have
been taken, but I think generally the
Indians are a poor harmless lot,
if they are not interfered with but
they are jealous spiteful and resentful
of injury

Have you heard if Capt. A.J. Burton has joined
the Indian Army



73

10485
I don't think he has, if so its very lately
I suppose. The East India Company will
cease to exist before long and India be
governed by her majesties troops.

I mentioned the princess's Marriage & departure
You have not heard that I presume

10486
No I knew it was to be about this time 
before I left but I have not heard any thing
since, I suppose the Germans have made
a pretty good job of it this time

[M?] have been very moderate 40,000 down &
8000 a year for life. Now I have told you a piece
of news. Cant you tell me some.

10487
Theres nothing to tell you that will be
in the papers there's been nothing doing
since [c?] was relieved

do you mean In Colins defeat of the [?]

10488
Yes

What is your opinion of Col. [Windham?]

10489
I dont think him a fit man for his
position a difficult one it is true.

Are you at [C?] now with Sir Colin

10490
I am not with Sir Colin I am some miles
from him.

What is the name of the place that you are at

I am near [C?] and so Colin
Campbell's Army is going towards [?]
The camp outside [C?] theres no name
to the place weve got huts

May I ask what day of the Month it is with
you now 

10492
29th Jany. thats what it is with you is 
it not

No its the 2nd Feby. with us the princess was 
married on the 25th Jany & gone home to day. 
74

10493    Have you heard anything fresh lately

I get on but slowly with the Spanish Friars MS. 
I have had a very interesting conversation from
Eltesmo  have you had anything in your
Crystal lately

10494    I have had visions of two or 3 people
lately that are dead, I have not called
my friends  from England or Spain, I
hesitate in doing so because I feel
sure it inconveniences them.  I dont
Know in what way but every one agrees
that it does so -- indeed I am satisfied
of it  for I know a case or two where
parties strenuously exerted their will to
cause parties to cross water   they partially
lost their senses and went into a state
of trance for some time,  and sleep walking
I believe to be in some cases occasioned
by it -- and perhaps other illnesses that
we do not know the Cause of

Ive another piece of news for you to tell your
friends in India

10495   I do assure you I shant tell them.  If
they think I obtain it from any one Else.

The Great Leviathan was safely launched on
Sunday.

10496   I should have thought she would have
been finished by this time.

It seems strange to me that you cannot tell me
any India News.  the death of any officer &c

10497   No officer has died, nothing has taken
place of any note.

Are the natives in possession of Cawnpore at this date

10498   No

I mentioned your wishes to Dr. M.  not to be called by

75

him & he says you came into his M uncalled

10499   He has called me, its not likely I sh'd
be continually appearing without.
he is not particular  what he says.  I
dont like him at all  I found out two
or three things lately and I think it
doesn't do very well to trust him.

What are your duties now.

10300   dancing attendance upon an old
Jackass that dont know his own mind
I hope however to be soon out of it --
If I do get back and dont have something
handsome  I'll sell my commission
however I must leave now and if
I have an opportunity of appearing again
I will do so

I thank you,

110501   Good night
10 PM.
                               ♂︎die  9 Feb.  1858     C. A. M.
                                      Invoked the C A.
5' to 8 PM.
In white dress, no border, Purple Robe &c.  a roll of paper
in his hands
May I ask if we can receive this Evening  the 
Explanation of the Vision  or the Continuation of y'r
Metaphysical work.

10502   I wish to give you first the preface of
the work  any thing in it that you may
wish to alter  or if there is any part that
ought to be left out.  or any addition to be
made I rely upon you for doing it
76
I should not like the book to have a Chance
of publication unless a few words of explanat'n
preceded the Contents.

Now the CA's unfolding it.

10503   You will probably not be able to finish
it this Evening as the latter part of the
book follows on the same sheets — When
You have done  it is sufficient for you
to desire it to leave.

We will copy as much as possible & I hope
we may resume it next Tuesday.

10504   Yes you can
If you have no Questions to put I will
leave.   but there is one remark first —
     You had lately here Seven O Mina to
meet his charge  and he gave him
very good advice on religion  something
has transformed since  I don't know what
which seems to threaten a separation
[SOM] has informed me that Dr M acts
so exactly at variance with his own
desires and expressed opinions that they
are not fit companions  having scarcely
any unity of feeling between them.
SOM is disabled from performing his
duty.

I explained.

10505   I do not wish him to know that I have
interfered — if you could see SOM a
few minutes  he would speak about
it and you can send him that. —
but Mr M. does not not act fairly with the
Spirits — he is always trying some subterfuge
they do not mind being openly questioned
on any Subject. Their answers tested by
77
all that can be urged for or against it
They like to be exercised because by it
they know their goodness is Strengthened
but when that has been done certainly
a degree of Confidence may be place in
them  and their Answers to questions
received straightforwardly and then
chopped  and it is not necessary that
the subject on which they are conversing
should be carried further.

I explained I would see SOM.  but my seers
health rendered me unwilling to open any
further seances between SOM and his Charge.

10506   It is a great pity that two men like
Mr M. and Mr Lea  after being so
desirous of receiving  the benefit of a
higher GS.  And each meeting with
one so perfectly unobjectionable to every
idea that can be formed of goodness
and truth.  not only in their words
but in their actions should when their
services are gained be treated by the
one so Lightly and by the other so
slyly —

Will SOM appear before or after the book

10507   he will appear when called.

9h 20' PM             Invoked Seven-O-Mina
I explained at length. & ment'd Dr M's Communication

10509     It was not me that appeared
I tried to impress upon him when he was here
and have always done so,  the necessity of
his giving his serious attention to these
subjects  if he studies them at all. - of course
I am not desirous  that he should devote
a great length of time to my appearance
or that he should give up his pursuit of
any one occupation  that he might be
otherwise engaged in - his interviews with
me need make no difference to that. There
is no need of its infringing either upon
his business or his rational amusements
is Even his Study of other Subjects --
     But whilst he is with me and I am
trying to make one , our opinions & inclinations
I on my part doing all to give him the
benefit of my acquired knowledge he must
receive it with sincerity and so far prepare
himself for the meeting as not to take
part in it with his intellect impaired by
drink.
     I scarcely like to mention it to him
feeling a reluctance to raise in a persons
breast feelings of pain anger or regret.
may be there are Circumstances that
extenuate it.  Still being so more than
once - I could not pass it over without
remark. --  And after having a little
strong liquor he is more affected than
many men. would be with a much
larger quantity  but still when in this
state at all You will agree with me
79
that it is the greatest disrespect he can
pay to the spirit he has called and
I regret to say that at such times Mr M
behaves foolishly. -- and has artfully
maneuvered to try to cause me to say
something in regard to himself and others
and then brought the same thing round
again so dressed up with other questions
and opinions to make me contradict what
I had at first asserted —
     I think all you need tell him, is
that I am more than Ever desirous that
he should while occupied with his mirror
give it his calmest and closest attention
that on the day he intends to use it ; the
day at stated periods set aside for it he
should take no more than a sufficient
quantity of intoxicating liquors and more
than this  he should be earnest in his
supplications to the Almighty  to keep him
in a fit state to Receive the Communications
that may be given him by spiritual
means. — but if he does not attend to
this strictly  Evil will befal him —
      That will be sufficient .

Will you favor me again with any stated day  & hour
on which he should Endeavor to develop his power
of seeing

10570     He must keep to a particular time, that
is what I desired him to do , a day
that suited him would suit me or two
Evenings a week.,

I explained

10571     Nothing can justify his being in that state
80

if the interviews are limited & the days
apart

I will communicate your wishes

10572    I thank you
1/4 to 10 PM  SOM left.

                   ♂︎die 16 Feb. 1858.  C A Mirror
                           Invoked the C. A.
8 PM
I referred to the previous observations of SOM relating
to Dr. Mackenzie   I explained

10513   I think it would be best for him to give up
the use of the Mirror until he has in some
measure overcome his embarrassments.
     Unless he can give his calm attention 
and his sole attention at the same time
things are certain to go wrong, he loses
the control of himself and also over his M
it would be best  much best both for
himself and Seven O Mina, otherwise a rupture
will take place
     His G S. will still do all he can 
for him without personally appearing
do not you have any thing to do with it
his affairs I mean.

Do you mean &c

10514     Yes  I would much rather that you would
not recommend him to one, if it was
possible for him to get one by other
means  for whatsoever business he may
enter into  he never will give a proper amount
of attention to it,  his head is always full
of different subjects  & he cannot control them
all.  
81

Mr M. has at the same time enclosed me a letter 
from the Rev'd      Wood to him on the doctrine of the 
atonement. Shall I place it ag't the mirror

10515    I should prefer it being read  I do not 
wish it to come in contact with the M.

I read the letter. & asked if I had made myself 
intelligible.

10516    I have understood
I should like to see  Mr Wood
I can sympathize with his expressed object'ns
but I cannot tell from what they arise
I should like to converse with him upon 
it.  on a Tuesday Evening --

I will appoint one at an early opportunity

10517   Do So.
20' past 8 PM    The C A left and the book came. 

10518    "To him in whose hands this may chance
to rest &c -- to the end of the preface.

Now the C A's come back

10519   Will you if you have time now or on
another Evening read it to me again

I will do so next Tuesday Ev'g

10520   I thank you

Now the C A & the books gone

                   ♂︎die  23 Feb.  1857.     C. A. M.
                          Invoked the C A
Mr.     Jones of Peckham  a Gentleman who has lately
taken much interest in Spiritualism & somnambulism
Especially its visible manifestations called upon me on
Wednesday Ev'g last (17th) not having seen any thing
of div'n by C or M he is desirous of investigating
it.

10521    It would be better at present that he sh'd
remain a stranger to it

I showed him my Ms & C and he expressed a
wish to have one like my box mirror with the requisite
formula.

10522    It is not well for the two modes of
communication to be [?],  if he could
see or be persuaded of the fallacy of
his own spiritual dealings I should be
pleased to see him.

On Tuesday next  a very old friend of mine who
was formerly much attached to this subject is
desirous of having an evening.  & to have the benefit
of your opinion upon some questions

10523   I will appear

With your permission I will now read your preface
as my seer is inspecting   She can inform me
of any remarks you wish to offer. -- shall I do so
 
10524    Yes, it was for that purpose I desired it

I read the preface and asked if I had been
understood.

10525   I perfectly understand it  there is
nothing I wish altered  unless you
have an objection to any part or a
suggestion for some addition

I have no objections to it -- [Do?] I have your permission to
alter the construction of some of the sentences to 
83

make it read smoother

10526   
You have.

Can you favor me with the commencement of the
4th book this evening.

10527    
I am not prepared with the concluding
work this evening.
I had thought there were some alterations
to be made that would have taken the
usual time.

Can we receive it on Tuesday Week.

10528    
You can.
I would not call next Tuesday Evening
Spirits in any mirror save this

I thank you I will not my friend formerly
used the Crystal - but not being a seer himself
& the visions proving very desultory sometimes
successful at other times failures he abandoned
the study.
         
10529          
For a man who has sought this kind
of knowledge and so signally failed in
his endeavors to obtain it as to disgust 
him with its futilities must have
attendant upon him a Guardian Spirit
unwilling to help him in a truthful
search.
   Enquire who that Spirit is and for
his worldly benefit as well as his hereafter
be assured by his presence of his goodness.
   If it is explained to your friend he 
would desire that a change should
take place for his benefit and it would
be best before he leaves England that
he should be attended by one better
able to guard him in the danger
attending such a journey


84
I am afraid my meaning has been misunderstood
my friend was not disgusted with it, but gave it
up solely from not having the power himself of
Seeing & not being aware that it was a special
gift — he was completely working in the dark

10530    But in his first possessing a Crystal
and its being inspected by one person
who had but a slight vision , if he
had had a guardian Spirit desirous that
such an intercourse should have taken
place it would have been sufficient to
Charge it once — he would then have
had pointed out the means of progress

I explained at length my own [experience?] of the
difficulty I labored under procuring visions

10531     but if any person  be possessed of a
Guardian Spirit        the advancem't
of the Cause and such a means of
Communion be opened between them
Every trifling  vision shown to whatever
person however for between is gradually
developing it , it does not matter how
frivolous , how seemingly far from the
Spirits motive  he is doing all that
he can thro' the means in his power
of advancing his charge towards his own
opinions , he may not be seen himself
his ex       may be unrecognized, his
appearance unknown  & yet he works
towards his End —
     But if a man has belonging
to him a GS. who is careless of his
benefit or a spirit attached to him who
is Evil they do not make the means open
useful for promoting his good
Mr. James Elliott of Garden [?] [?]
gave me the first Crystal I have  10, July 1834.
it was a sphere similar to the one described in
Aubrys Miscellanies  p 129. -
                   [Illustration]

And in                     1838 Mr. Tho.s Hare / of Pothare /
gave me the Oral Crystal.  ded'd to Hunder.  from
whose Custody by his consent I discharged it &
gave it to L. P. J. Burton.  The [?].

I first commenced the Study of the Crystal in Aug.t
1824.  copying a number of old MSs upon
circle work which my kind old friend Mr.
[?] Denley lent to me.

In 184       on the decease of my friend Mr.
James [?] Stevens I became possessed of
my beautiful Japan Crystal.  & in 185
the late Earl Stanhope game me my E. S.
Crystal.

85
they neglect it and going on at random
the student either gives it up or falls
into the Company of spirits who lead him
to destruction.

let me observe that not only in my former Experiments
from 1834 to 1842 were the results unsatisfactory
to me — some persons seeing a Vision   others not
& not being aware that Spirit Seeing is a special
& even rare faculty — I at length  out of regard to my
wife gave up its use — but even since her decease
& when I had obtained the assistance of my
present excellent Seer — the visions were so uncertain
& so frivolous that I almost despaired of [pressing?]
it to any real use, now with the Exception of
M Brown of Nottingham. who deals only with
planetary Spirits   I know  of none  but of the
great number of practicers who have succeeded
so well Even as myself.

10532    do you know of any among your
Acquaintance or by hearsay , who has 
striven so long a time to arrive at
ultimate success.  who have thought
so much upon the Subject, who have
collected every kind of work bearing
upon it , and who have at last when
seeing a possibility of success so
steadily pursued it and been so
devotedly attached to it as Yourself

No I do not.

10533    Then why do you wonder that you have
succeeded when others have failed

Since I have been favored by your Guardianship
my success has far exceeded my expectations but
formerly  from my limited knowledge of Spiritualism
I had nearly abandoned all hope.  & others most
86 
Must have felt & experience the same. 
10534 
but for this want of knowledge you 
lust no interest in it 
I was aware that. Communication could be made 
by the Crystal but I thought it could only be 
done by Emblems. —as if I asked a time. the 
Herb would be Shown.—or a Vision of an absent person 
required their form would appear but I did not 
know that languages could be expressed had 
my then GS only have given a word it might 
have shown me that important results were 
within my reach & tabued accordingly— 
10535 
And do you not know that no Spirit 
can speak first Either in the L or M 
at least when I say no Spirit I mean 
all those classes from the first to the 
Seventh: who do appear in Such 
beyond that exceeding the limits of the 7 there are such that can do it. 
It is an old halation Amongst Cabalists & Exorcists 
that a Spirit must first be spoken to and if 
you remember on [?] You Kindly spoke 
first at my request. but I had thought that 
the speaking alluded only Conceived Circle work. 
10536 
I mean the first appearance, the first 
words, it is not so after the first interview 
the Spirit is requested he can begin 
the Conversation after that—So that the 
Appearance is all that can be given 
to one first using it. 
For years after & first had I tomders Crystal I 
did not know that—Language would appear in 
a Crystal. but only Symbols 
10537 
When they are not addressed they used 
such signs 

87

My friend Mr Oxley gave it up & also astrology
partly from the odium attaching to it.  & partly
because religious scruples led him to conclude it
might be unfortunate.
Can you ascertain how many G S's I have had

10538     Yes I can

Can I also have their names

10539     I will learn the names of the two
Earliest ones. -- up to the time of [?]
Guardianship you had two

I should much like to see them.  there are
some questions I would like to ask.

10540   I will do so.

When will it suit your Convenience to give us
the explanation of the vision  or shall I wait
until the fourth book is completed

10541   The Book will not take long to
finish

I will then Call you on Tuesday next

10542   I will appear

2nd March 1858. M Mirror 
10’ past 8 PM Awaked the L.A. 
Present Mr Jhis Randolph Oxley 
You were kind enough to provide to accutain the 
names of the GS I had before Hinder became my GS. 
10543 
I have engined about them, and find that 
You had two attendant upon you at the 
Same time one Good the other Evil 
DESTRAY a good one vut not of great Eimerce—a Spirit now calling himself 
PROGRESS. 
10544 
The other one ABTEMMUMAR a low 
Spirit belonging to one of the planets at that time Venus I believe. and since a 
wanderer of the Earth. 
Nere those the Spirits attending one from by birth useful Hander became my GS 
10545 
I know your birth useful the time Hander 
became your G.S., I think, you have 
that dat if not I can produce it. 
I shall be obliged by your doing so 
The doctrine of Bulardian Spirits is to us inexplicable 
we are every referred to them in the New Testament may I ask how an Evil Spirit became my GS 
10546 
They were attached to you at Birth but 
before your intellect was developed and 
your actions guided by your will as a 
responsible being neither had any influence 
over you because you needed not the 
power of the one to strengthen you against 
the projects of the other your nature being 
free from Sin 
Are we not biassed in our actions & Consequently 
in the Events of own Lives by our individual

& [?] yet not Commit Sensual Sin's, or he
maybe very Sensual Yet exceedingly affectionate &
Benevolent.--
10547
The child or the Man that sins unconsciously
Cannot with Justice be responsible for his
Sin, but directly that he Knows that it
is Sin, with that Knowledge of it he has
the power of Opposing it, of going a different
Way and is justly punishable for as the
passions in Youth become developed So

Every age Shows the increasing necessity

of the offenders and make their Sense of

But why do Some persons have only a good Spirit
to protect them--whilst Others have their baser
qualities instigated by an Evil Attendant.
10549
The Sins of the parents are Visited
upon their children, if Evil has been
Attached to a family it clings to each
Succeeding generation--So that it remains

Sincerity and humility upon his Almighty
maker.

Mr. Oxley took hold of my Seers hand & requested an
Answer to his Questions

10550  I can answer your questions at a more
Convenient distance to yourself.

[?]RO.  Has my past life taken altogether been Sinful
or good.

10551  It is hard to say whether one man's
life tends through its whole course either
towards sin or truth. , at different times
he is different. and not one action or ten
actions can be the Criterion
     It is not for me to say whether the
past has been good or Evil, your own
Conscience can best tell you, and He
alone knows who reads the depths of the
human heart—If you have had reliance
upon his Son, faith in his merits as a
Saviour , hope in his mercy for that future
when the body of flesh shall give [forth]
place to the body of soul you have done
well.    If such have been your conduct
be guided by it in future remain firm
to those principles   strengthen by all the
Evidence you can obtain And you have a
Comforter within you that shall be of
91
greater Service than the things of life
that shall avail you when frailty
[?] Support you in [?] or misfortune
and carry you safe to the resting place
of happiness prepared for the believer
[?] Have I my remarkable Spirit attending me
Good or Evil now.
10552
You have a Grandiose Spirit and he is
good for his name is VERTERUAL
of the first Sphere.
I find that he is opposed to the
Communion of Men with Spirits on the
grounds that it is injurious to them as
mortals and not necessary for their Spiritual
welfare he argues it would have been
mentioned in the bible (NT) and [as] it is
not mentioned there although not prohibited
Is Verterual a good & faithful Spirit
10553
Yes he is a Spirit of the first Sphere
My friend has been all round the World & is [?] on
the Eve of Starting to New Zealand to a Settler with
[?] wife & Children altho' much attached to this
Subject & also Astrology formerly he has disciplined
the Study, and fearing it  might distract his brothers
for the Serious duties entailed upon him and Strange
land he does not feel inclined to resume it.
19554
It would not be Well for him to give his
Attention to this Subject he had better go
on in an ordinary [?] having nothing to
do with things beyond the Common [?]
of life and traveling to his Maker to extend
his holy influence so as to guide him
on the way most pleasing to his Light
and whether his Special welfare be watched
over by a being unknown to him and his

MO. Is my mother's Spirit at rest.

10555  She is progressing towards happiness.

MO  Can you tell the cause of Certain horrible dreams I
had for many years about her.

10556  I do not know how his (TRO) were occasioned
particularly but I know how they are
occasioned generally. Only a few evenings
since you had an instance of a party
living and a party dead causing each
other uneasiness from the thoughts of the
one acting upon the other.   that was the
thoughts of the living fixed upon the dead,
this may be the desires of the dead fixed
upon the living    it is so in many cases
a person dies with extreme regret, at leaving
one particular being or object has at the
last a long desire to be with it and with
the thoughts fixed upon it  they awaken
to their new existence still the mind
dwells upon that same object as firmly
as when on Earth   it keeps the deceased
person from arising.  for whilst their
thoughts are directed downwards they
remain there , it needs that they shall
be directed to a high and     before
they can ascend and it troubles the
93 
beings on whom then thoughts sopatrainomy 
rest 
Is m father at rest is he satisfied with my Gratitue 
10557 
He is progressing towards happiness and 
is Consequently ignorant of the things of 
the world. Until the remain takes place 
his sone is nothing to him. he only 
knows of beings of his own sphere, doing 
as he does for the same end and the 
same purpose for looking back none 
of them can pressure 
My friend being about bearing England firsts Antipodes 
May I ask if you dc 
10558 
For his material advantage I can give no 
advice I am too little acquainted with 
things to judge of the best mode of 
proceeding and for his spiritual State 
the doe times of Christianity are Sufficiently 
grounded within him to make the souls 
welfare sane I would recommend him to 
Strengthen those principles by the record 
of that existence divine yet human as 
surpasses for example and precept away 
words that could be angled however strongly 
by Either Spirit is mortal, and if the

that it. Will be acceptable to

♂8 PM. 16 March 1858 Some house 
Misinou Mirror 
Awaked Ellesmo. Ms Lea Spex. 
I mentioned my Seers illness requested Ellesimo to paror us 
with replies to our questions. 
10560 
I will do so. 
I am sorry to hear so bad an account of her 
heath. but I must under the influence of him 
who is the fiver of all good. that the will 
Soon be restored to health again, and I deeply 
regret her hot being able to inspect the Mirror 
not only on behalf of yourself but for the 
benefit of my charge 
As my Seers health is so bad the wise be unable to 
receive your much coreled communication on the appointed 
6 April next—As we shall all lament losing the oppit 
may I ask if you would fown us with through our 
present Seer Mrs Charlotte Lea. 
10561 
I will try to do this but I should have 
Preferred its being with your Seer. her 
vision being at present so much more 
powerful. 
As it is unfortunately quite hopeless to expect Miss 
Leigh to be able to inspect—may we Solicit your kind 
Endeavors to impose Mrs Lea’s Visions—that are 
may by enabled to receive it. 
10562 
I will use all my influence between this 
time and then, in trying to impose her 
power of sight Sufficient for the occasion 
by Mrs Lea diligently Calling me on Tuesday 
& Fridays and my advise the CA may 
have to give you doing your Seers illness 
I should be most happy to give through 
the means of Mrs Lea’s Seer. 
In your last esteemed work you quoted Matt.  May I ask of you to favor us with your version of the Gospels - I should be pleased to be at the expense of publishing it for the benefit of other Spiritualists.  I should like you very much to do this.  I should like that all your fellow  creatures would be enlightened on these Subjects and be brought to think more Ernestly and deeply of the life to come. 
You could Either favor us with one of the gospels or such portions of all as would make one complete. 
I should prefer the latter and I [?]  that Mr. Lea will still endeavor to lose a little of the anxiety that he has Concerning these Subjects it would be better for him and his [?] he is too anxious but he is much more [blank/missing word?] of them than he formerly was.  
The C.A. regretted that Mr. Lea healed there [?] too lightly.
There is not a word that he receives that he does not ponder over seriously, too seriously.  I do not wish it to weigh heavy with him I merely give my opinions for his good but I do not [?] them to be impressed too much upon his memory, but he is rather foolish at times with with his remarks that he makes but I do not feel this as I know his mind too well, and I feel pleased also that his Seer directs her mind of every other feeling when inspecting the mind. 
Leo asked me to inform Mr. Lea
96 
That he would like to appear to him this 
evening if agreeable but he will not be able 
to top long with him—I think his wish is to inform him fo his progress onwards 
will it be agreeable 
Mr Lea will be most happy 
10566 
he will appear in you (Mr Lea’s other mirror 
Some time since a spirit calling himself the CA 
appeared in Lea’s Mirror—to Mis Lea.—but it was 
not my GS the CA. & tho he asserted himself to be so 
10567 
It was a C.A. but not your GS. 
I am most willing that the CA your 
guardian Spirit should appear in this 
Mirror & this mirror only. 
then if any Seer continues unwell I will take an 
opportunity of Soliciting his Appearance 
10568 
You can do so 
May I ask what kind of Spirit the other C.A. was 
who so strenuously insisted that he was my G.S.—
As Mis Lea had never seen the here C.A.—I could 
not have detected his Imposition but form formula 
my GS. gave to me. 
10569 
He was a good Spirit and he wished to 
come in contact with a mortal. I do 
not know why he stooped to that piece 
of deception. 
But such false assertions casts a doubt upon his 
“Goodness” 
10570 
that is not the only doubt that it is 
given rise to. 
Can we commence on next Friday with the gospels 
10571 
her sight must be more strengthened then 
it is at present. besides I have already 
informed you it is a book which belongs 
to others as well as myself. I do not 
97 
know whether I should be able to have it so 
soon
I am afraid I am misunderstood I meant the Translation 
of the Gospel  not your promised work on the [?]d April 
I did not understand you 
I would rather that you should pick only
10572  
Some questions and I would answer them
and as her fight strengthens  I would give 
more lengthened responses. 
Is is my wish that you should be thor-oly 
satisfied upon my question  upon religion 
that you should think put to put. 
Mis Lea the Speccolatrix here remarked Mesino is rising 
upon which I requested him to stay—and instanced 
that my kind GS. the Aonned Angel stayed with 
me until I requested him to depart. 
10573 
I would stop any time if Ms Lea wished 
me but I have explained to him that 
I stay till I find it is becoming painful 
to his Seers Eyes, I do not ask this 
when I find that it is affecting her head 
& leave—I would not willingly leave I 
would prefer staying longer. 
May I ask of when you leave me under be favered with 
a vision— 
10574 
I would have no objections showing a Vision 
but I do not wish to test her sight too 
severly for what would you gain i f
you were to gain all the information for 
one evening and then lon it for some 
half dozen to come 
I hope on next Friday to be here again, & I beg to 
assure you of the perfection your responding affords me

opportunity of thanking you for the 
many kind prayers offered by you 
for my progress. and the happy results 
arising therefrom.

Minehouse ♀ die 19 March 1868. Ellesmo’s Mirror 
Invoked Ellesmo Mis Lea Spex 
Ellesmo immediately appeared. 
If previous to to my questions E had any Communication to make 
I have it is from your Guardian Spirit the 
Crowned Angel. 
10586 
I informed him of the illness of you 
Seer and he regretted it very much. as he 
knew the disappointment it wd. be to you not 
to continue there studies which are so dear 
to you, at the same time wishing me to 
inform you that his influence for your 
welfare would still be with you, and on 
any occasion that you wished for his aid 
to call upon him diligently and he would 
be with you. 
I beg Ellesmo to convey my thanks and that I would 
take the first opportunity of calling the CA. my 
Seers health permitted 
10587 
I will inform him 
If any communication for. H. Lea 
1058 
I have not 
I referred to his quotation of Mr Matthew. c. v. 
with opening of his work on the Practical Laws of 
Life.—which tho not precisely the same as Either our 
protestant vision or that of the Roman Catholic—Untain [?] 
of Guesback’s. was equally connect.—& I mentioned the 
Book of Revelations & the diversity of Opinions held 
by learned in reference to it.—and asked if 
Ellesmo possessed an accurate version of the 
original this opinion thereon . 
10589 
I am aware of the existence of such a book 
and they were visions that were given to 
him Visions that were most readily 
given then than now for more had the 
107

power of beholding and understanding the
doctrines that were then given to them

I read the 1st Chapter. of the Revelation of St. John
the Divine and at verse 12 Elt: said

10590    It ought to have been the Seven Spheres not
 the Seven [branches] [Candlesticks] Churches  v 11
 
I read verses 11 & 12  When E. said "thats a wrong

10591    translation  there could have been no Candle
Sticks   he saw seven spirits representing
Each one his different Sphere.

I ended the Chapter

10592     There were no Churches and the light
that he saw was not from the Eyes (v 14)
but a light sent forth by [?]

I read the 2nd chapter.  & at Verse 7 E said

10593     It is wrong  He hates nothing, there is nothing
in Creation that he has a hate for.  that does
away with the idea of His being charitable
and loving to all mankind

Verse 7 

10594    It is wrong   may I trouble you to read
3 verses back

I reread v 10

10596    That is very wrong "It was be faithful
unto me and in the end thou shalt
recieve Crowns"    it would have done away
with all his goodness if he had told
him the troubles he would have had to
surmount.

Verse 11

10597     he is wrong Spirit doth not converse with
power of speech.
V[?] 24 [?]
he never received that in his vision for it does
[*10598*] away with  the goodness and loving kindness 
and with the last and greatest  not of
our Savior in dying upon the cross for
the Sin of Man
End of Metaphor
He never gave [hope?] loving this Earth
[*10599*]He sent his Son upon the living to know
Mans [?] and tho' [He?] became
acquainted with Mans desires and he
kept with the rule [here?] to himself
I have read the [?] first that it happens, many I ask
whether they form a portion of the New Testament
You have not the Spiritual world - the same as
your quotation from Matthew.
[*10600*] I [can?] inquire
do you not know the contents of the whole
Testament as received by the [Xiam?] World.
[*10601*]  I do.
Then at a future time if agreeable to you all [ten?]
and [devote?] his [evenings?] to receiving from you
a presentation of the Gospel. Either the 4 is the 
perfect one.
[*10502*] This quite do, and as his [?] Light
improves there are many interesting
books belonging to us in the Spirit
world that I should like not only
him but both of you I became
acquainted with.
The Seer remarked that [Elterno?] appeared about
having I [requested?] him to stay for observation
long the a remained with me at our many sittings.
[*10603*] You are not so anxious for me to appear
as I am to remain.
103

If you cannot remain longer will you favor us with
a Vision

10604    You had better not have a Vision
Mrs Lea's health is not so good this Evening
and I do not wish to tax her power of
sight too much.

Lero informed us that you would give the name of
a Spirit who is good & healthful -- yet could give
Mr Lea advice as to his worldly affairs -- will you
be kind enough to do so.

10605    If Mr Lea wishes it most Certainly

We shall be very glad to receive him if we have
your Sanction

10606    He is a good Spirit but a low one
if he was not he could not come in 
contact with mortals to give you any
worldly advice

Will you please to give me his name that Mr Lea
may invoke him in the other Mirror.

10607    A - - - L

be pleased to accept our thanks and on ♂︎Evening
we will renew our Enquiries --

10608    I shall be most happy to appear at the
time   I must also be allowed to express my
regret at your Seer not being able to inspect
for you   I will mention your kind 
wishes to your Guardian Spirit  the C A.

look between the Seer & me.

19 Mar 9 PM Sero’s Mirror 
Mr Henry Lea Invoked AS. 
He appeared to the Seer but very small & indistinct 
and on my ML. requesting him to appear plainer 
he replied 
10609 
I shall be able to be seen better on my 
next appearance 
To what order of Spirits do you belong 
10610 
I am a Spirit of the Sun. 
He appears all in white but only about an inch & 
a half long. 
Will you appear next Tuesday 
10611 
I will do so—I regret not being able to 
make myself plainer 
but it is my first appearance in any 
Mirror or Crystal. 
How can Spirits of the Sun have any interest in 
or wish to communicate with spiirts of this Earth. 
10612 
was I a Spirit of a high order of the Sun 
I should be unable to do so—I am at 
present but a low spirit. 
but will you not also progress as Sero has done
10613 
As Sero or any other Spirit who has a 
wish to advance 
What were you precisely to being a spirit of 
the Sun 
10614 
I was a Spirit of the 2nd Sphere 
The Second Sphere of what 
10615 
The 2nd Sphere of the Sun 
how many Spheres are there 
10616 
Seven. 
There are Seven——(this was illegible) 
I must leave. 
Will you appear on Tuesday if Called

Ellesmo’s Mirror Mis. Lea. Spex 
Invoked Ellesmo 
Ellesmo appe. 
May we continue our questions upon the Revelations of 
St. John 
10618 
You can ask your questions but I am afraid 
Your Seer is too unwell to use the responses 
As AS could not appear plainly on Friday owing to 
its being his first appearance in a M or C may we 
inspect the other Mirror to see him as being a lower 
Spirit he wd. appear with less pain to the Seer. 
10619 
I would much rather that she did not 
inspect at all 
If any advice & e 
10620 
I have only to express my regret at Mis Lea’s 
return of illness & trust it will not be of long 
duration. 
Ellesmo left. 
8 PM. ♂ die 6th April 1858. Limehouse 
This being the 6th of the 3rd Month, I expressed my regret 
That my Seer Miss ESL was unable to receive Ellesmo’s 
Esteemed work and asked if our present Seer Mis 
Lea would receive it 
10621 
I also regret your not being able to receive 
this the 4th book. but your Seer will not 
be able to read it her sight is not suffly 
strong and I have reasons for her not 
inspecting the M for any lengthened period 
I hope Mis. Lea’s sight will gradually strengthen 
that she may have longer sittings 
10622 
It will do so but she had better be 
content to receive a little now & ultimately 
[See illustrations on opposite page.]
106

be able to receive so much useful information
that I can give him.

Our greatest solicitude to receive your works at the
time appointed,  is the regret at their being lost to
us by an unavoidable omission on our part  we have
already been deprived of the 1st book.  and to lose
this  the 4th is indeed vexatious to us.

10623    As the time comes round again  so shalt thou
receive both of these works,  your book would
not be complete without them.  and you
shall know them from the others for they
will be marked.

10624     The first   [illustration]
                The fourth.  [illustration]    /see opposite/
     
     By these thou shalt know them from the others
whilst we were discoursing there appeared.

10625     do not fear you shall have them all in due
time  I mention this so that in making 
your books you should leave sufficient room
so as to receive them in their proper places
That was my reason for giving them in
that form.

I beg you to thank the C. A for his communication.
I am indeed sorry at not being able to comm'e
with him.

10626    I know that he too with myself, only
too deeply regret not being able to appear
to you
     If you have any remark to make
I will willingly be the bearer of them.

May we request you to favor us with a Spiritual
Vision which will interest us & improve the Seers
"This was the first time the Seer had seen 
the "Mirror Veiled"  & was a part of her progressive
faculty of Seeing.
[*Vision*]                                                         [*107*]
[*10627*]  I will do so and you must be careful
in writing them down. [?] [?] Seer's

10634 
The Mirror is now darkening all over, also 
distance—now its coming to the front of the Mirror 
its getting light and the Mirrors veiled, the flowers 
On the veil are becoming light or rather the veil’s 
Going and the flowers are left, theres the same 
Spirit that was in the Middle of the last Vision Sitting on the marble seat dressed as before 
He has moved and has helped up his hand 
there is a beautiful pain of splendid doves, caused 
all over with angels and flowers in a most delicate 
manner.—he is knocking at the door, the doors 
opening wide this way now he’s standing in 
the threshold—
Now I see another Spirit dressed very 
different to any I have seen before he is coming 
forward in front of the doors—his dress is all 
Lace, I can see right through the dress he is 
like a statue with a lace veil over him and 
round his waist a splendid band of beautiful 
topaz stones, he has light hair with long 
circles, and very long wings all while except 
at the lop edge which is tinged with a beautiful 
flesh color—he has a different crown on his head 
made of different Stones Ruby and diamond 
and in the centre at the top is a topaz. 
they appear conversing together, the first 
One has boned to the other, who has taken him 
by the hand. and they are crossing the threshold 
they do not seem to go any further as [they are] 
there is a veil beyond them.—Now theres such 
a beautiful smile come over the 2nd Angels face 
now the Veil’s opened 
Theres Seven Spirits as tho’ on a white 
Cloud. they are flouting down to these two 
112

The first one is kneeling  the 7 spirits are dressed
all in lace  they appear to be singing, now they
are down even with the others  some standing up
and the Cloud is underneath  quite flat -- now they
have raised the Cloud up  it looks like gauze.
I can see some reading -- they are holding it
up in front of the first angel and he is looking
so anxiously at it

[10]635     "Thy faith has been stronger but thy reward is Greater"

they have given it to the 2nd spirit  Now they are
taking the first Spirit onwards  they are all going
on together -- There are such beautiful trees.,  but all
appear as tho' of splendid stones -- and theres some
beautiful flowers  are coming up  there are 4 rows
or squares on each side and seven spirits on each
square.
     the first spirit of the 7 others that first came
has some very little children with him, theres one
small spirit  in each compartment  (7 spirits & a little
one to each square) -- Now the 1st and 2nd spirits have
gone to a beautiful seat of carved gold.  They are
sitting  looking at the 4 rows of spirits on each
side  at the back of each department of the 8 spirits
there are thousands of other spirits
     Now its altering
     In the 2nd square on the left side theres
an immense lot of books and in the next (1) to that
Myriads of minute flowers.  the leaves of which
appear to be one sparkle of diamonds, the next (3) one
seems to be full of musical instruments & golden harps
& in the fourth (4) one  they are all kneeling as tho' praying
  4     5     on the right side at the top (5) the spirits
  3     6     appear as though watching over something
  2     7     but I cannot see what. -- now the next (6)
  1     8     is becoming plainer  they seem to be busy


113 

teaching in the next GI they appear as tho’ anxiously 
& busily watching a little child.—the end one [8] 
has not changed.—[the 1st and] they are still 
sitting with the one child in front. 
Now the 8 figures are all going off to 
the sides leaving the first and second spirits 
sitting on the golden throne., they are all 
gone. Now theres a splendid light more 
brilliant than any I ever saw. coming over 
their heads—now theres another spirit coming 
thro that light—he seems flying, I see it now 
very plain it has a wreath of flowers something 
like may blossom only the little petals are diamonds 
he has come in front of the spirits and turned 
slowly in front of them on the diamonds are all 
Letters or characters. he keeps on turning the 
wreath. The first spirit has bowed his head 
and this last spirit has given the first the 
wreath.—now the 3 spirit has put out his 
arm & dipped his head slightly & is floating
away from them.

Now the 1st and 2nd Spirits are getting
up the first one looks so much more cheerful
they are walking down the [arenne?] to the golden 
gates towards me. They have come as far 
as the veil and the veil has fallen & closed
them in. and I can see in front of the doors
an immense number of Spirits flying upwards
they are all going -- the Mirrors becoming quite
clear -- Its all gone

Oh. last I met at [Saint?] [Moonsons]?/3rd [K?] with

a few years since a person who used Crystal [work or with?]

Not in this Mirror I do not wish
any Spirit beside myself and the CA

10643
I will give you his name on next Tuesday
Evening when I appear in this Mirror
I must beg of you when calling them
to be particular in exorcising them.

I presume my usual exorcism will do

10644
It will be quite sufficieent

I will use it 3 times

10645
I was going to tell you to do so

After I have rec'd their answers to my questions
will you favor me with your views as to their
correctness.

10646
I will do So - after their appearance
You will then have their explanation
and my opinions upon their different
points of view and doctrines
I trust your Seer's health is improving

I thank you I believe it is slightly

be done correctly. I would not be so
anxious but it is necessary.

My seer being unable to inspect I am quite prevented
from applying to my GS. for advice + for past
reasons I cannot with confidence call him here
as another C.A. Endeavored to delude me ( )
[Yom Gs?] would not lead you to do that  [*117*]
[*10652*] which is wrong for he is good and he is
holy. And he would not have undertaken 
you in his charge to have neglected you 
when you most needed his protection.
[?] you will you favor me with the vision
[*10653*] I will do so
The vision will appear in a quarter of 
an hour. 
[El?] left 3' past 9.
18' past 9 PM    The Vision
[*10654*] The [?] is gradually [?] a long 
distance from the front of the Mirror and coming
gradually up the front - Now the veil is [?]
& parting off towards the sides
I can see the 1st c 2nd Spirits and all
the beautiful trees again, the Spirits are [sprinting?]
to the trees and they have both turned their 
faces to the row of trees on the right and
under each of the leaves of the trees [?]
pretty little angels sitting down with their 
little heels resting each on a leaf, they are 
singing - The 1 c 2 Spirits have bowed to them
and they are also singing.
Now they are [turning?] to the left, the trees
on the left differ from those on the right they
have long leaves like [Indian?] [h? h?] with
precious stones hanging from them all
brilliant & bright and at the back of the 
stones are [?] flowers as though
suspended from [branches?], all the branches 
have now changed with little angels exactly
118

as though they were flying  they have something
like gauze which each holds in the right hand
it looks like a Cloud -- now its rolled up and hid
all the Trees,  its a light blue cloud with white
fleecy edges and the little Angels are flying
with the Cloud over the 1 [?] 2 [Angels] Spirits.  now
its slid down by the side of both of them
and now its even with their feet and the little
Angels that were sitting -- & those with the Cloud
are going up as though over the trees.
     The Cloud has gone under the 1[?] & 2 Spirits
feet and all the little angels are lifting them
up.  or rather they are going up. -- the 1 [?] - 12 Spts
and all the rest are singing -- they are moving
up and I can see the Trees again underneath
them. -- the Trees are all gone  & the angels &
cloud are still ascending  (that is the other portion
descends)  now they are lowering again  and I
can see some most lovely  gates far  very far
surpassing the others   I cannot describe them
they look like frosted silver   Edged with
Gold  and tinged in various parts with a
beautiful pink  all carved in figures and
flowers of the loveliest kind.
     Now theres come on the Gate
10655     "From Whence none shall Return"
     The 1 [?] 2 [?] spirits are going up  the cloud 
rolls away with them.  The Cloud is gone
and left them at the Gate and between them
and the gate are all little angels,  the gates
are gradually opening, and just behind
a kind of lace Veil or Curtain has fallen down
and I can see a great number of angels all
in the finest white lace dresses -- the dresses
119

are off as the shoulders and and all over 
the throat are beautiful flat stones down to the
waist -- a breast plate of stones 
   The 1c 2 Spirit seem unceasingly singing
they look so happy -- the lace veil is still
between them and the [spirits] figures - now
they are going in at the gates they are inside
and the gates are closing -- the Spirits are gone
in and the gates shut
   Now the gates are going the Mirrors
clearing -- theres some reading come.

10656

10' pat 8 PM   Invoked Eltesmo

Eltesmo appeared as usual

May I ask you Eltesmo if on [?] die you made
a communication to Mr Lea thro AS the spirit
concerning my "thoughts"

10657
I did

Allow me to offer my most grateful thanks but Mrs
Charlotte Leas health is such as to make both 
I and her afraid of putting her in a trance
for a Spirit to speak through her, besides -- 
There are the objections to such a procedure given
in numerous responses by the C.A.

10658
It would not have been a Spirit 
speaking it would have been herself

Still I should be afraid of it injuring her health
& my own health gives me [ant.?] objection

120 
10659 
I would not have hurt either her or 
or yourself it would only have been as a 
fascinating fit—but I would in no ways 
grant that now I know Mis Lea’s 
objections, but it is upon to other 
ground than fear. and I should all
like in fact, I would not give any 
response or advice that was not strictly
true. at the same time inspect reliance 
on all that might have transpired ————— 

I hope you do not feel our decision it is out of 
any  disrespect to you 
10660 
No, at the same time I must 
not to feel it unkinc on the 
Mis Lea. 
May I now ask the name of the Spirit NS

121

As I shall most most probably not be in London
next Tuesday. I must postpone calling any other 
spirit until I return, but on Tuesday next Mr Lea

Is can be so but I am sure Mr Lea is
always happy when you are with him

Is Venus inhabited by beings similar or 
analogous to the inhabit and of this Earth 

10674
some parts of it 

do they build dwellings &c

10675
they do they no sooner have a desire
and that wish is gratified

but that shows the inhabitants & their dwellings
[and] are spiritual and not material like those
on this Earth 

10676
they do build their houses but they can 
more readily do it than you upon this 
present Earth.
122

If you have an objection say yes or no

10682
Yes

10683
my mission is doing good, seeking
to lead others to do good, but there are 
spirits on [venus symbol] whose occupation are of 
a different nature.

Are your offices confined to the inhabitants of [venus symbol]
or do you interfere in the affairs of mortals
on this Earth

10684

10685

They do with more worldly matters and
do not at present seek to rise any higher
they are beings that have been mortals 
on this Earth.

Is it possible that Mortals from this Earth go
to the planets.

10691
There are many who do, they have a
clinging to this Earth and they hold 
communion with Atmospheric Spirits

Your appearance & their are similar to the Spirits
appertaining to the spheres of this Earth are the
Spirits of [planetary symbols] like you

10692
I am aware of their being such
planets but I do not hold communion
with any Spirits connected with them

it will not be the only time I shall be
called.

Would you favor us with a Vision or picture of
the inhabited portion of [symbol for Venus]. - as it inspires the
Seers Vision so much.

10697
I can show her that part inhabited
by those who were once mortal
You must bear in mind that it is
my first appearance, and I am only
too well pleased that your Seer has been
able to read my responses and I shall
be most pleased to appear on any
Evening you may be disposed to call

not have so much difficulty in reading

Can you inform us how me + my friend Lea

     Now there's something Coming , its a large
Mansion of reddish brush with high slanting roof.
Nine windows in a row along the front, 3 rows
high and the Chimneys are built at the sides
with high Chimney pots of plaster. , a large
flight of steps with Arched doorway with
figured hinges  garden and fields  all round
its a very pretty place,  now the doors opening
theres marble pavement in the hall  Octagons  black
and white.  and an immense lot of flowers
inside,  theres another door inside like a
green baize door — such a beautiful staircase —
stone stairs all up with beautiful carved and
polished balustrades  [all]  now there's a door opening
I can see inside — such an immense room
theres a door at the other end   I can see
a man and woman sitting in this large
Room.  She is dressed so strange   She has
got a short waisted frock on and short sleeves
like a little childs frock body  of very beautiful
blue Embroidered Satin — they are both reading
the chairs have high backs with twisted pillars
down [them.] The sides and worked backs and in
Each window  is  such a large China Jar.—
All but two and they have Chinese Cabinets. — I can
see the pictures on the wall.  one of the persons in
the picture has long light stockings and pointed
shoes and large Rosettes in the shoes  and
large buckles in the Rosettes , Red trousers
fulled all out like a balloon and a satin
waistcoat with immense pockets & flaps over
them  an old fashioned coat with large sleeves
and lace sleeves underneath  on the table is a
large Cloak with Ermine on & a fur Cap like a
126

a coronet, a crown + a sceptre.

It is with deep regret Ellesmo cannot
appear to night he has some duties
to perform. in the Spirit world.

26' past 8.  Invoked Faith - oval [M]
on 2' he is here but indistinct
I requested him to appear plainer

10704
I am not able at present to make
myself more plain

In reference to the Vision last Seen may I ask
who the parties were + the place

10705
No Answer

I repeated the question

10706
It is not in existence now but it did
exist in devonshire it was Father and
127

daughter and their name was Leigh

were they related to my Seer

10707    I do not know of their being related
I have not seen your Seer but I have
heard of her.

I mentioned her lengthened illness  our fears  that it
was hopeless. I asked what he had heard Concerning
her.

10708    Of her being Such an admirable Seer &
being able to draw  so well.  but if you
like I will leave and  enquire whether she
will get well or not. —
     Yet how far more happy would she
be were she to reach that land of happiness
which once gained none wish to return
     Surely if you mortals could but
divest your [eyes] selves of the horror of
leaving so miserable a place as this Earth
is , and reaching  that where all is joy
peace and unity , all with one thought
one feeling — none deviating from the ways
of truth.  no one wishing to take advantage
of another ,  imagine all this and you
will then fall short of the happiness
of the True believers.

I referred to my poor Seer — & that from Circumstances
(See page   )  I was afraid at present to call my
GS. the C A. to [?] his instructions & requested
Faiths advice

10709    I would pray earnestly & in that prayer
would ask your GS. to nominate one
to watch over her and Continually be
with her that her health might improve
under the Guardianship   but [a] I have rec'd.
while being here a Communication
128
10710
"Your Seer will have sufficient warning
given her in her self not by any other
Mortal. when that time shall arrive
She has Seen that Spirit once She
will see him again I think you are
acquainted with the Circumstance

I mentioned Constantine appearing  [*185*]

10711
You are quite right

When do you think the time will be

10712
We have no idea of time - all seems to us
as nothing.

here he held his hands spread out.
I mentioned again my regret at not being able to 
Call the CA - because the present Seer had never
Seen him + could not therefore Identify him

10713
Your GS. did appear to Mr Lea on one
occasion when he made an appointment
for Mr Lea to come to your house
that appointment was kept, but the
2nd appearance of a C.A. was not [kept].
Your Guardian Spirit - I cannot make
out why he insisted he was so.
Ellesmo would not allow any Spirit
to appear but him Either in his [M]
or in yours

I will take an opportunity of Calling the CA.
Now theres a Shp come at the side of the Glass and
Faith is intently looking at it Now the Shp is turning
to light and its gone.

10714
Your Guardian Spirit would have informed
You through Ellesmo and will do it thro'
Me.
He wishes me to inform you that he is
Continually with You. and uses all his
influence on your behalf + will still
continue to do so

129
10715
I could not ask him that. the message
I havE receivEd Comes thro another order of
spirits before it comes to me.
It would take some time for me to inquire
that way back. but on my appearing again
I will inform you whether he will do so.
I could havE answered it [now] but I do not
wish you to detain me now we are all
May I ask the occasion
10716
we are receiving others into our Sphere,
and those other duties which I am not
allowed to explain .
10717
It is not impossible for Evil spirits to
do any thing no good spirits could
do this — I should be very sorry for
any person devious of their future welfare
to attempt it
May I ask if when you leavE You could favor us
with a spiritual vision
10718
I can not givE you a Vision Now. I
could not stop with it and I should
not like you to receivE one unless I
could be with it
10719
I am sure when I inform you that
I am called to carry the souls of the
departed to the realms of peace you wd.
not wish to drain me , and may [?] he
who is the disposer of all mankind watch
ovEr us all and make us to walk in

When she was [dreaming?] he mentally called [Lea?].
I was with him and tried to impress upon
[*10731*] him the necessity of making her peace
and offering up her prayers to Him
who is the [disposer?] of all things. I tried
to impress on her mind the necessity






132
   of forgetting all worldly objects and think only of Him [this?] could carry her. Safely to that place of [bliss?] [where?] [none?] would wish to [Return?]. If [this?] [?ill] [near?] the South [?] hopes she is [?] with what he has done [?]. He can rest assured of this for she knew before leaving this world that he would do that which was right and just.

10752 The present Seer will be able to do so. After a time - that time has [?] specified she will then retain that power, but if it was grounded sooner you would [love?] it again, for her [after whine?]
I [?] to [?] that the Spirit [?] [?] that the Spirit [?] [?] Spirit of [Symbol for female or Venus] does not answer my questions in relation to that planet but only to such questions as we can get better answered by you.

If truth only repeats what he has been taught [?] had better confine [our?] [?] to your [?] Solemned Communications
10754 There are things that he can inform you that I cannot and I have no doubt that you will find it so in [?] Communications one with the other. I have been just lately informed that a [?] who is [?] in [London?] [?] to some acquaintance of mine that [?] [?] Mount [Viginius?] there exists a learned philosopher [?] [?] and [unearthly?] that when a [?] was placed behind him, this gentleman asserted he himself - [?] this light through him. 
10753 It was not through him that he saw [?] [?] can be seen through, he was hidden from view by the [?] of [?] [possible symbol for Jupiter] in fact there is nothing that can be done by the will of [?]. 
There is now an [?] [?] in London who [?] at the [?] of some friends than present [?] a perfect stranger [?] tracking [?] [?] to [?] [wound?] and walk back some distance then [?]

10756 I am untrained I have never heard of that, I [?] Engine into it I explained the action of the [Moraic] wind and asked if he knew the [law?]
10757 No answer
Hear you [?] objection to answer that question 
10758 It is a magnetic power which some persons possess.
It is with that as with this [?] not every one that has the power. The higher the grasp it is Caused by the strong will it is not the grasp that has to do with it - it is the will.
Now these characters have come. 
10759 [T IMS T?]
what are we to understand by the Characters our 
Seer has copied 
10760 
They are marks of the Spirit having to do 
partly during they use those three letters 
or they would not have the power but 
there is only Evil attached to it. 
Should they engraved on the lod or town by 
the person. 
10761 
The Spirit who attends them uses them 
but if they were Engraved on the wand 
it would become much more powerful and 
they are known to but fear 
I presume there need be hr invaccation used

I have [?] written my paper many cunning accounts of urgent [?] very men to has frees [?] to appear thats like together [?] then down. Then Huntry with and go home- I such [?] reject. He will they done

10764 I was at the time I offered those words for your use.

10765 It was a something [counted?] with yourself and you [?] [cried?] [?] I wished you to become acquainted with but that is passed when [clairvoyants?] are [Cordial?]  on [?] of which are [solemnly? ] [?] on their Normal [?] by what [?] one they [E?alled?] to speak so [?] diagnosis of [?] and then comes

I have to [?] long [peril?] suffered from hearing of the right to be of the [?] which makes me fear paralysis, and I thought of [comanding?] [a?] [Dedies?] the Clairvoyant - of you [?] 

10767 It was upon this that I should have spoken - When I have done communicating with you in this dialogue I will leave for a short time, to Connect you GS. I would rather you [?] go by his will I feel you would have more confidence that from my self.

I have [?] my advice to give [?] on his affairs 

10768 I have not any upon this wordly [?] [hers?] a [?] to [?] of [?] who I know

10771
Your Guardian Spirit the C.A. would
rather that you should apply to a
Medical man , but at the same time
wished me to inform you that he has not
the Slightest objection to your going to this
Clairvoyant but must impress upon you
the necessity of your earnestly Calling
upon him at the time and he will be
with you.
He wishes me to inform You that
it is his wish that you Should on every
other day while at [?] Call upon
him mentally at the hour of ten in the
Morning at the same time placing your
hand on the side of the head most affected
You had [?]. — he wished me to say , You
had better let cold water run on the one
Side of your head till it aches & then rub
briskly for 5 Minutes with a Coarse towEl
As Spirits havE different inclinations & offices are there
Any good Spirits who are Capable of giving medical advice
10772
I will Enquire of the CA and when I appear
next Tuesday Evening I will inform you if he can
appoint one
On Tuesday next their I will solicit your kind appearance. 

10773 I am [appeer?] and [?] then way the blessings of Him who is the ruler of we mankind rest with you and no for her [ther?] Omen. Es gone 20' past 9 pm.

[Ellcomro? Mimer?] [Mrs C. Lea Spex?]
[Invoked Eltesmo?]

Have you seen the CA. as [?] alledical Spirit

10774 I have but he has not [app?r?led] one [mayor] kindly ask the C A if he has any advice to give me about my dear young friend and Seer. 

10775 I will do so. 
I will do mine for you I will give you a seal if your seer can copy [it?]
[Ellesmos] going hes gone - 3' now his coming [?] [?]

10776 You G S [wishes?] one to inform you that you must not leave your seal with your seer. 
The seal then appeared which one Seer copied and as we were discussing some of the [characters?] upon it there appeared

10777 You can remove and explain and after all Hickley has copied it I will return [?] if he can then fold it in a piece of soft leather his seers eyes must not rest upon it - he can then send it by foot and have his returned.

When I had finished my Copy at 9.15 I walked Ellesmo and and when he appeared I explained what I had [on?] [me?]

10778 It is my earnest wish of you [?] to arrange it, to send it by the first frost you can write your letter and the instructions which I will

142

give you

10779    You can go out and get a box if you so
wish it  and send it in --
     I wish her to wear this near her heart
placing her finger upon it night and 
morning saying the Lords prayer, she
must not be one minute without it, and
I think that you will have news of a
happier kind in a short time
     be kind enough to breathe upon it
at the same time calling upon your guardian
spirit and me when you leave it at the
post.
     I must leave the rest in the hands of
Him who is the disposer of all

25' past 9.
While I am gone for the box will you kindly show
a Vision

10780    I would rather decline as I wish my
influence to remain with what I have given
You

[symbol for Mars] 31 Aug[?] 1858                 [??? house]
Ellesmo's Mirror
Invoked Ellesmo

May we ask some questions this Evening
 
10781
You can do so 

Can we also be favored with a Vision 

10782
You can have a Vision if you your questions
Are not too long

I regret to say the Gentleman who attends my dear Seer
ESL. gives us no hopes of her.

10783
You must not despair it would be better for 
her if she would carry out my instructions
more strictly 
You must urge upon her the necessity
of doing so.

May I ask your opinion as to her declining to receive
a Clergyman.

10784
her own prayers will be sufficient if 
they are addressed to Him who is the 
[disposer?] of all things - and a strong 
faith.

She suffers great pain -  Yet from many reasons I
am afraid to mesmerise her.

10785
It would be very wrong of you to do so 
very wrong indeed - I will give you 
another Seal if you think she will
adhere strictly to the rules I might lay 
down.

I will ask her and let you know next Tuesday

10786
You can do so - 
I think it would be as well to sit and 
converse with her on matters connected 
with the next world - 
You can do this without bearing too 
closely upon your own opinions in 
respect to her health.

Mr Lea's sister is here - if she takes the 
Seers hand will you inform us if she has the faculty
* same time  I know full well how it has acted
144

faculty of Spirit Seeing --

10787    I will but before doing so I have one
remark to make -- you have omitted to
say how the rules I gave you for your 
own guidance has succeeded at the *

I thank you much.  I have followed your instr'ons
and find my brain much better.

10788     I will give you some further instructions
in respect to that at another time

Mrs Thorne laid hold of the Seers hand. and I asked
if she had the faculty

11789    She has that power

Would it be best for us in trying to develope the faculty
to use a Crystal or a Water Vessel.

10790     A bottle of water  I would prefer, it would
not take much time -- her power of 
vision would be after a short time far
exceed the power of Your Seer.

May I ask if FRITH is really a Spirit of
♀︎ as from his Evading giving me any answers to
my questions relating thereto  I felt somewhat
inclined to doubt

10791     I should not have mentioned him had
I not known him to be that.

But he appears either unable or unwilling to give
me any information relative to his sphere.

10792     he is able to do so.  and I think willing
at the same time  I have laid down
that he shall not lead your views to
any thing that is wrong, I think
that after his appearance at a few more
sittings  say 3 or 4 times  he will be able
to give you that which is interesting & 
also amusing

As I have to write down the responses  may I
solicit that they may not come so fast.  as we
often to our great regret lose a portion

10793     I have explained my reason for doing so
before,  it will not always be thus.  

Have you any objection to some of your responses
being used in my intended article for the Telegraph
10794  [?]
I am very [desirous?] that my [kind?] 
146

10790
"So have I passed away"

I can see a smile flit across the face of the spirit
on the side were the words were & theres more
reading Coming on the other Side

10799
"As I have Sown so shall I reap"

the spirit above says.

10800
"And this shall be thy reward"

The spirit above is flying over the head and Coming
in front it still keeps the wreath in its hand
it is coming down to the front of the Chest of
the figure and theres a ray of light gone into the
chest of the figure somewhat in the shape of a heart
I can see the light right thro the figure — now
the side spirits are coming in front they do not
float like the top spirit they are moving in
front and their heads Arch over in front of the
head of the figure — one has a book which he
given to the figure about 3 inches long but not
so wide. on the back of the book is

10801
"This is the work of a Truth which thou
must learn and when completed thy
End shall be peace."

Now the figure has turned its head and bowed
and the spirits have moved back.— Now the left
hand spirit is moving he has a golden Key
he has put it over the neck of the figure there
are many precious Stones round the handle
of the key.

10802
"This shall open the gate whence no
Traveller shall return."

& now he has placed a small wand in the other
hand. & said

10803 
"lean not upon this reed lest thou Stumble"

The mortal is now turning round and the little
spirit with the wreath has turned its heels to me
147

Now the other Spirits have [?] and they are   
going away and the [Medal?] with them. [It follows?]
them as if were motionless. 
Its all gone. 10' to 9PM

[Ellesmo?] is [Returned?]
Will they appear if invoked

10804   
I will appear on the 2nd Tuesday in
September, and bring his mirror with you.

& any advice to give M [Lea?]

10805   
I have [not?]

May he inspect in the other Mirror to see [Ms Anderson?]

10806   
You can do so if you wish but I would
rather the Seer should [leave?] off inspecting
for this Evening - 

[die?] 14th Sept 1858                 Limehouse
[Ellesmo?] [6?] Mirror                 Mr. Lea Spex.
Invoked Ellesmo

25' to 8 PM

As we wish to [l?] Mr. [Th?] [p?] had we better
call for an [old?] Spirit [first?]

10807   
She had much better begin with visions
I shall do all in my power to [prevent?]
any evil in coming in contact with her
while inspecting - 

[I thank you?] [?] [?] in other [?] where
[?] inspected for the first time they have been
much alarmed by the appearance of evil forms.

10808   
That was my reason for wishing her to see
a vision before calling a Spirit as she
will not be able to see a good one at first

Had she better lay hold of my left hand

10809   
She can do so
148

As my dear [S?] [E?] is now confined to her bed     
and for certain [lea?] can not any longer wear
your seal how must I dispose of it

10810   
As I gave it for her benefit which she 
cannot wear you had better destroy it
with respect to [worldly?] views you can
either bring it here and destroy it or destroy 
it at your own home
  You had better bring it here, and
destroy it, and before destroying it, call
upon me and I will appear

& any advice for M Lea

10811   
I have not

12' to 8
Now [Ellesmo?] has [thrown?] such a [strange?] & [immense?]
light past my (the Sun) shoulder to you (F.H. 
who was standing behind the [levers?]). 

10812       
I was about to tell you to place your 
Mirror in front of this.

I [invoked?] Ellesmo for his past form

10813    
I have only given you advice - it [has been?]
from [your?] GS. [He?] having no other
means to communicate but thro me.

7' to 8.  Ellesmo gone.

                                  The C.A. Mirror 
Invoked the C.A.         Mr. Lea Spex

The C.A. is here I never saw any Spirit so [beautiful?]
& luminous before. It is almost more than I can
bear. I [?] strongly. and earnestly [explained?]
a hope that my present Seer might not be deluded                
as before (                )

10814   
Do not have a doubt
149 
I regret exceedingly having been deprived of the 
happiness of receiving your advice for so long a time 
away to the illness of my dear young friend. Yet 
I feel you must be aware how often I have 
Solicited whom kind services 
10815 
do not distress yourself upon this matter 
I have been with you and shall ever be 
with you to the end of time. 
I have taken upon my to become a 
responsible being for all your actions and 
when you can have not longer a Seer to 
inspect for you I shall still use my 
influence over you. 
I am only too happy to find that 
Mis Lea’s power of vision is improving 
and I trust will be able to receive and 
I am sure will be willing to receive any 
Commucation I may make thro the 
Mirror when your late Seer shall cease 
to be. I gave her that seal through 
Mr Lea’s G Spirit to ease her as far as 
her worldly sufferings were concerned 
but she is now beyond the help of 
Mortal and must remain now and her 
in Him who is the disposer of our destinies 
but as Your Guardian Spirit I will use 
all my influence on her behalf in trying 
to bring her to make that peace that is 
so requisite to all mortals before quitting 
this Earth.— 
I am asked her to see a Clergyman but she has 
declined 
10816 
I was about to make this observation 
to you, It is not that I hold with the 
150 
Churches of any particular sect but I 
think he would explain to her passages 
of scuplure better than you or any other 
mortal who is not acquainted with the 
docterines—if you know any one who is 
a Christian at heart. 
10817 
Let that be as you please I shall always 
be happy to give you my opinion upon 
that or any other matter you may 
think a fit subject for inspection 
The CA then again promised to use his influence 
and be always near me. & in very small letters 
the following came 
10818 
I am aware what has transpired between 
you and your employees with respect to Mr Lea 
and Ms Leas GS. I gave him my opinion 
as well as his own upon the matter which 
————-I have leant this from his 
GS and must now leave it with you to be 
the best judge 
10819 
I wish you to offer up your prayers tonight 
& morning Calling upon me when you do 
so on behalf of your Seer E.LS. 
The CA left 13 past 8 PM

the same time inspecting saw a scene in a 
J’nest and the moon rising and passing this that 
Came to a water scene with two ladies and a 
Gentleman sitting at the edge fo the water the 
ladies had parasols and one of them had a 
fancy basket in her lap—& at 25’ past 9 it vanished

Mis L. 
Ellesmo is here as usual 
Since I was last here I have lost my beloved Seer 
LSL. 
10824 
I was aware of her death I informed your 
friend Mis Lea of it before you wrote to him 
I know of her death for my influence 
was with her as you had not destroyed 
my seal. 
I hope to have the Seal. next Tuesday when I will 
under your instructions destroy it— 
*  a silvered Mirror formerly Lero's, called black
    from the frame.  
do to
Your late Seer Est will appear this evening
She wishes very much to do so but if your
friend Mm Lea will not feel offended he will
oblige her by leaving the room.
If my dear Seer wishes I cannot object if Mm Lea
is willing.
[*10825*] I am sure she has no objection to put
for you.
Shall I call her in this Mirror
[*10826*] No you had better use the Mirror you have
[inspecting?] this evening
but that has not been [Consecrated?] & consequently
not under the Charge of my good Spirit
[*10827*] I was not aware of that you can call her
in the black mirror [*X symbol*]
When Lea said to me "but will that interfere with A----
appearing to which E replied 
[*10828*] No it will not
Will you ask the [La.?] to appear next Tuesday and I
will bring the [?].
[*10829*] I will do so
[*10830*] I will inform you after you have had a Vision
of you late Seer and I will inform you
what the [La.?] asked to communicate to you
After the interview I should prefer being
called into this Mirror again
I am surprised my late dear Seer should with to
appear She always appeared in her lifetime her great
objection to doing so.
[*10831*] [This?] something she wishes to inform you
of.
I will then call her trusting to you to present any
Spirit other than you from appearing.


& onwards and great will be her reward if she seeks diligently
and were not your kind G. S and myself being the GS of
your friend not to (watch continually over your welfare) we
should cease to be what we now are to you.  our occupation
is to watch over you diligently, and when &c.  
153 
10832 
I would not have mentioned it to you had 
not I intended to use my influence on all your 
behalves.—You will not allow yourself to be upset 
when she appears to you as it will be fore your 
good and her’s also 
My only objection is my fear best any one else may call her 
into heir Mirror by the formula. 
10833 
That will never occur to her when she has ceased to 
Commune with you she will then progress 
onwards, and when He shall think fit to 
call you from the face of this Earth. You will be 
more prepared to meet him than you would 
otherwise have been 
That which is perfectly hidden from 
Man are the ways of Him who is the father 
of us all and that must be your wish as 
well as your fellow mortals also to penetrate 
————————— 
We will pray, &e 
10834 
That will be so, and when she shall 
have gained an order there will not be a 
Shadow of doubt that your GS. will bring 
her with him for her to tell you how rapidly 
She has progressed he will be continually 
watching over ————————and when I 
informed you of this I am sure (you will be pleased) for her progress onwards if it had 
been otherways—————— 
I hope my dear Seers will soon progress &e 
10835 
It will not be a long time past 
If any &e 
10836 
I hope not, only that you & I will appear 
next Tuesday Evening he gave me no further 
instructions for you. 
[Action Ended]— 
D Mackenzie has the article in [type?] ready for 
next month.

10842   
I would prefer its not going in.

Your wish shall be attended to

10843   
I thank you

I am going to Mr. T's tomorrow evening [?]
my [?] [crystal?] to see if Mrs. T can have a vision  

10844   
You can take it with you and try

When my GS gave me an [?] like your last. I
found that I did not succeed and I would rather
be told Yes or No at once it would [save?] their &
my disappointment

10845   
has she ever inspected for you before 

She has inspected 2 or 3 times I had [slight?] visions

10846   
before I answer your question further I 
will [?] if your GS who she is 

Ellesmo left and returned instantly

10847   
It would be best for you not to [develope?]
that faculty -

I thank you [?] then take the Crystal
May I ask if I can call the Spanish Monk to 
learn from him when my present Seer shall begin
the [?] or rather continue it

10848   
You can call him but do not be disappointed
if he does not appear. I think it is possible
you will have to call him 2 or 3 times
before he appears - but it will be fulfilled 
through her.

Their [?] asking any questions in the Gospel may
I ask why our Lord did not leave his [?] doctrines
in a complete form & so prevent the [?]
misunderstandings [?]
& minutes of different [?]

10849   
They have [?] them to sail their own
wicked purposes - he did leave behind 
155

him [rules?] that were [strictly?] laid out       
for mortals to follow, but they have been 
destroyed - could he help after he was 
called to his heavenly home the [dangers?]
of wicked men

Yes because I have divine teachings which he left
for the Eternal welfare of mankind he also has
the power to [protect?] and [prevent?]

10850 
No answer

Can you favor me with their lost [rules?]

10851   
I will do so after you have had your Seer 
3 or 4 [first?] lessons - You will then see [and?]
be able to [?] better the meaning of her              
lessons and also the doctrines that are 
destroyed

Then we must let that rest until after our dear 
[friend?] appear which we suspect to be in Febr. next

10852   
let it be so

We see from Matthew XIII [v52?] that [Jesus?] had 
[altered?] and expanded [?] parables in
[re?] to the Kingdom of God. [If?] his disciples &
had been [warned?] that they [?] them
but then appear to have been lost.

10853   
It was so but they did not hand them 
down

Can we have them also given to us

10854   
I have already promised that you should 
have much more than your expectations
[could?] [reach?]

As our Seer [labors under?] a [severe cold?] can you
favor us with a vision

10855   
I can grant her a vision but I did not 
expect she could have seen at all she
has been so ill

We will then postpone our visions questions while another 
157

Evening and [?] the Vision  
              
10856   
let it be so
You will have a Vision in a quarter of an hour 

25' to 9

10' to 9 PM           The Vision

10857   
     The Veils come I can see a Spirit as tho
draped in a thin gauze or rather the gauze before it 
which I can see through it has a crown on its 
head which seems a blaze of splendid stones
and something round his neck that hangs down
in front and [t?] off at his [robe?], there are [two?]
center rows of stones and two outer. he has a [?]
under the gauze and one fastened [round?] the waist with
a band his fingers are loaded with rings, the
the face is very much like the face of [Our L?]
     Now I see as though there were very [rough?]
[waves?] and now there's a small vessell with two 
[persons?] sitting in it but they are more like mortals
they appear like fishermen, the [waves?] now are
dreadfully rough and the vessells tossed about 
from one place to another, it looks as though 
they would go down - Now the Spirit has folded 
his arms very quietly & calmly I cannot see the 
boat theres nothing but the Spirit & the waves
the Spirit is [?] on the water & the waves
are rolling about [?] as he [cracks?] along. The 
waves become as smooth as glass. - he is 
standing now in the middle & the [?]
roll about him, they are getting calm and I 
begin to see the boat - the Spirit has extended 
his arms at full length. Theres a [light?] gone 
from the tips of his fingers & the waters are 
becoming still [?]. His [rings?] now are ablaze 
158

Ellesmo’s Mirror 
Invoked Ellesmo 
I have called you first this Evenign but my G.S 
The C.A has promised me a talesman to perceive my 
health which my Seer is to receive. 
10861 
I am aware of his appearance here 
this Evening 
Could you give Mr & Mis Lea Talismans for the same 
purpose 
10862 
I could do so 
Have you any objection to forming them with one 
                                                                                                                          /28th. Dec/

10864   
I have not

When will it be [convenient?] for you to do so

10865   
The last Tuesday on the next month

May I ask if it will be best to call you [Ellesmo?]
one week and my G.S. the C.A. the other [alternately?]

10866   
I will [convene?] with your GS upon this
subject.

If [C?] [&?] Mr. Lea wished to to contact you on my
Tuesday he could do so

10867   
I will always appear most willingly when 
called

The 6th of next January is the day on which we hoped 
to have received your [co?] [work?]

10868  
I think you Seer will be able to [receive?] a 
small work but will not be able to receive the
[co?]. [I?] should be given to you
4 times a year but that will be.

I shall be glad when the Seer does [not?] [read?] so
quick - she seems to see too quickly indeed of too
[?]

10869 
You are [wrong?] in supposing she sees too
quickly - it is her not seeing quick enough

but she sees and [reads?] quicker than I can write 

10870   
Some of the words are there long before [she sees?]
them and it is only with great difficulty 
that I put sufficient illumination for her 
to read them, you see it is not my fault,
but she will [?] that

we will [?] with you [as?]

10871   
   I am [s?] you cannot have a doubt upon 
the subject - [Shes?] equally powerful to
me when part of my sentence is lost
but I must [away?], I [tarry?] too long
Your Guardian Spirit is [impatient?]
  Will you be kind enough to discharge 
her I shall not appear again this evening

8:20' PM
160
Invoked the C. A.
25 Past 8 PM
The C. A is here
This Evening is the one appointed for you to favor me
with the telesm agst Sickness may I request it

10872
I should like to ask you if you have some
Vellum ready. as I should like to impregnate
it this Evening for you.

Will you also kindly impregnate the telesm you gave
me some years since
161

regard to his faculty of Seeing in the M or C not
in any way improving — and my iintention of invocating
for him as I worked to assist him.

10877
I do not wish you to do this Especially
for a time —
     I have given you my opinion upon writing
and writing mediums  as my other Communicat'n
with Mortals different to the one that
you adopt.
     However good the doctrine may be Let
forth for a time it is only as a Subterfuge
to hide their Evil designs and when they
have gained a sufficient power over mortals
they then find out their Error when it is
too late.

I mentioned before that  T. Jennings'  (Dr M's. Spirit
friend) discourses where not unexceptionable . and
that he had Stated he was a Spirit of the 5th
Sphere.—

10878
He is not of the Sphere he is a very
low Spirit had he belonged to that sphere
he would have known his GS.
     SevnOmina would not lend himself to
any such deception

Will S.OM. inform me how Dr M will best
develop his Sight

10879
I will learn from SOM all I can on
his behalf. I do not wish to give him
any advice of my Own. 

Shall I speak to you again next Tuesday fortnight on the
Subject 

10880
You can do so
May I now refer to the System of Divination by
Cards   You favored me with (       ) & observe that
I have some queries in relation thereto & may I.
162
Ask them When you appear again
10881.
Not the Next time
I will ask when we again meet when it will be agreeable
10882
do so on my Appearance at any time after
I will readily answer any question you may
ask
May I ask you to favor my Seer with a Vision
which at once greatly gratifies us & improvEs her
Sight.
10883
Not this Evening
Mr Lea's GS informed me he did not wish
her to inspect for too lengthened a period
I then referred at length to the tradition of the
Wandering Seer & the numerous Anecdotes connected
with him — and asked his Opinion
10884
Our Saviour was never so Revengeful
he was Ever just and Kind,
It is doing away with his Charity
towards mankind was he to inflect
upon a mortal so heavy a punishment
had he insulted Him — He would havE
Shown him the Error of his Ways and
givEn him a time for repentance and
had that been fulfilled in faith
he would have been savEd—
The Subject has been so much discussed specially
Among [?] of the [?] like m[e]yself. that
I hope you will not deem the question frivolous
10883
You are but Mortal.
May I [?] that I am desirous of Calling the
Spanish Monk — when shall I do so
10886
I would prefer your Calling him in any
other day than a Tuesday — it is not the
only work that will be givEn thought
Your present Seer — That will Astonish
153
Your much more than that
I think if you refer back to some
of your MSs. you will find there an
offer from me respecting [him?] [finding?] [your?]
[in to?]seers possess of vision to your present
one, that is now granted .
I hope I've lent to all [some?] happiness here and
hereafter.

10887 It would not be granted would it reach
            any other result
May [lack of times?] &etc.
10888 I hear not I am going to ask you to
            dismiss me.

    Invoked Selesino
[Ellenino?] here
Dr Mackenzie is  [d???s] of pub your article
"The practical laws of life" in the [seventh?] number
of the [Burlingine?] Review.  and I also should be 
pleased to see it there
    I cannot help or understand Dr M's 
    vein or yours but I have reasons of 

10889  my own, I do not (apt) wish that 
             article to appear yet.
Instead of humbling you with requests [??]
wait till you inform us when it may appear 

10890  let it be so.
May we be favored with a Vision
             I will grant you a Vision of one who
10891  Left this Earth. Who spent his life in
164
the service of his fellow men and did
not look for a reward hereafter.

before receiving the vision may I remark that all
Mackenzie has expressed his Entire willingness to
give up his present Spiritual Commn by his Mothers
Med??ship - altho it wd be a great deprivation, if
SOM wishes it - and I am desirous of receiving
SOM's instructions as to developing [MW's?] sight

10892
It would be much better for him to withold
his communion with his [??iting] medium
for his power will never be developed whilst
he holds communication with those whom
he has so often been guarded against.
He must have a little more patience
tell him he has not been so long a
seeker and a devoted servant to these
sciences as you and your friend

Will you request SOM. to appear or favor us
with a message for DrM. by the CA. next Tuesday

10893
I will do so.

When will it be convenient for you to give us the
lost parables [?] by our Lord to his disciples
as referred to Matthew. xiii.-52.

10894
You shall have Every thing you require
in due time

We wish also to Call the Spanish [M???]. So
that my Seer may get used to him - after the
vision

10895
You can do so be kind enough to use
the other Mirror for your vision to appear
in

do you mean the [M] formerly [Xero's?] or the unconsecrated
[M]

10896
It would be useless calling a Vision into
the one not consecrated - the vision will

10898         The Vision

Now the Mirror is becoming clouded the 
mist is of a different color to any I saw before
its like the suns rays - its a [gauze?] colored veil
[be linen?] amber & yellow - [n?] it has [p?] down
the centre
   I can see the figure of a Mortal a
very, very old man he has a black velvet cap
on fitting low all over the top of his head
he has something in his hand like a horn
and a black coat very long theres [some words?]
[come?].

10899
"As I was"
he's gone as though he fell away vanished into
nothing (this much startled the Seer)

   Now theres something else coming its the
same face again but dressed in white edged 
with black - theres more words come.

10900 
"As I am"

I can see his long bony hands so thin his face
looks 10 years older than in the other [dress?]
now its becoming so light I can hardly look
at it yet a different light from that of other [x?]
it does not seem to come from him, but thrown
down upon him - now there's 4 small Spirits
by him they are floating near his shoulders


166
theres such a beautiful expression gone over his face the 4 Spirits are Children - & they have held over 
him a Crown of flowers—the flowers are very 
beautiful yet unlike any I have seen. the 
Children have wreaths of flowers over their right 
shoulders & fastened at the left side with another 
large flower., their dresses extend a little 
below their knees their Arms, legs & feet are 
bare. There dresses are white pink, blue and 
lavender.—they also have beautiful little crowns 
on their heads, their hands meet holding 
the crown over his head. now they have placed 
it on his head and thry are flouting back 
coming away from him—now they’re stopped 
Now from the right a [“a” inside double box] hand comer 
of the Mirror theres a larger spirit coming 
Down a tree has a staff in his hand with a 
wreath of flowers running down it, he has come 
in front of the old man. [depiction of staff] and said 
10907 
“ As thou hast sown. so shall thou reap” 
and he has placed the staff in his hand—these 
letters are very beautiful and have flowers at the 
top and bottom. they are something like our 
flowers but much more beautiful.—they are 
standing looking at each other but the spirit 
is moving to the left side fo the Mirror [depiction of Mirror] 
and theres a little dark spot at the back 
of Mir Ousn.—its now a tree & very splendid covered 
With a large yellow fruit—but the leaves of the 
tree are not very large.— it is indeed a beautiful tree. 
Now there are 4 more spirits coming 
From the top one fron each corner and hot 
167

and two in the middle the two corner spirits are
in purple and the two middle are in pink
these last 4 Spirits have feathery wings very
large extending above the head - the wings of the
other Spirits are smooth and small, these [s?]
are very beautiful they have gauzes with them
the same color as their dress which they hold
in their hands now they're divided and the
middle Ss are come on each side

Now the 4 top Spirits are coming down
they are below the children and 
the bottom Ss [?] up
they have opened their 
gauzes which have gone 
under [Mr. O?] 6 feet as
though he was standing
on it and the Spirit has gone behind him
now the children have taken Mr. O by the arms
& feet and laid him on the gauze with the
staff by his side and the first Spirit is kneeling
on the gauze and the little children are also
on the gauze - 
   Now each of the 4 Angels have lifted
up one hand their other hands holding the
gauze and they have thrown out from them
as it were a wreath of flowers which rest above
Mr. O, it looks so beautiful - Mr. O is quite
encased with the gauze I cannot see him now
the four Spirits have changed their position
they are floating with their hands [?] backwards
supporting the gauze & floating away with it
its nearly all gone - its gone. 10' past 9 [& theres?]

M MacKenzie is desirous of part of the essay by [Elleinso? [in]
"The Practical  laws of life" in the [present?] No of the [Biological?]
Magazine - may I ask your opinion as to its being [pub?]?
Thy were given to M Lea by his guardian
Spirit - they were given by his GS. to him
as a lesson.
M. has also expressed his determination to give up his
Spiritual Comm'n with S. J.  [though?] his mother is an
initiating medium and as he is so earnestly desirous of
[?] opening his faculty of mirror seeing - he wishes me
to call for him, that it may be the speedier developed
With respect to the writing mediums you
have my opinion upon those subjects [not]
before not only now but at a former time
I do not wish you to call for him with
any one there beyond yourself.
May I ask if you have seen [sessions?] of [mine?] and obtained
any communication from him for T M.

10905
I have and his advice for T MacKenzie 
is to dismiss all ideas from his mind of
using Communication with tapping and writing
mediums - if he persists in doing this
soon will cease to be his S.J.
He must wait with all due patience
and he will regain his power of Vision
had he adhered strictly in calling him
[169?]

10906
he would have been able to have seen 
S.O.M. by this time 
SOM wishes you to impress upon
D.M. the necessity of strictly adhering
to all that is good and beautiful
further wishing me to state than on 
Some future evening he will appear 
to call Lea and give her some instructions
for him
Will you please to name a time

10907
I have no idea of time and SOM did not
inform  me
When shall I favored with the concluding
book of your Spiritual and Metaphysical Philosopy

10908
No change
I repeated the question 

10909
I did not rightly understand you
As SOM as her Vision is a little more
powerful
As my seer is unwell may we be favored with 
a vision that will interest her without distressing
her sight so much 

10910
you are quite right I will give her one
I mentioned as to my Telesm  I also am fullfulling

You will not receivE any communication

As I am rarely here except on [? o die] will it do for
Mr Lea to call you.
10 923
I would rather that you were Present
If I call you for a few Minutes the last thing
on a Tuesday will that facilitate your appearance.
10 924
It will do so
do you think my present Seer will be able to
Complete your M.S.

She will be made to complete it.
Could you favor us with a Vision that would gratify the Seer and interest us—

I would but I am not allowEd to do so
I gavE my word to, your seer and I
cannot go from it.
Could you suggest any means to facilitate her Copying

May  I observe that last Saturday was [?] day the
anniversary of the Birth of Our Lord as kept amongst
Christians  may I ask if that also is a day of rejoicing
amongst good spirits
It is there cannot be too much rejoicing at
such a period as this when he was sent
to be the means of reclaiming so many
lost ones.
Is there any probability of one being informed of the
right time according to [?] chronology of JC's birth
He was born in the las month of the
174
Year and the date was not as you mortals
Suppose the 25th but the 7th
On Saturday next is the Commencemt of the new Year
I hope on my own part to keep up and preserve
Your kind protection & guidance for my Eternal Welfare
10933
I do not see any thing to prevent it
and I trust that you may turn your
mind more than you have done to the
world to come , for be assured you will
find more peace and Consolation in
following out that which is good.
And on behalf of my Seer I hope an increase of
her power of discerning Spirits that I may receive
Your fortune [?] correctly
10 934
It will be so but you must wait with
all due reverence.
May I depend on Your presenting the other intending
C. A Spirit[s] who asserted his Guardian ship over
Me from appearing in this [M] consecrated to you
and thereby defending me
10 935
I should cease to be what I am were
I to do so.
I thank you I alluded to it only because my Seer
not being so well acquainted with your appearance
might be united as before.
10934
He did not appear in this [M.]
Mr. [?]. Jones of Peckham has returned my Mirror
which I lent him (    ) with the intimation
that whilst he possessed it his seers lost their
faculty of Spirit seeing both in that and also
in his Crystals and that he also lost the greater
part of his Spiritual powwr or faculty of receiving
impressions may I ask why [?] View of the Cause
10937
Trust the Spirits that he called here
of a low order — they were Evil and he
175
Seers havE not the power of inspecting
his seers had the faculty of discerning & had receivEd
visions which were, not least one of them was, accurately
fulfilled & verified—
10938
That was done by Evil and it is not to be
supposed that using your box Mirror +
the Call rightly first that any could
Appear therein .
Mr. [?] to havE two Ms made like my
oval or box M. Shall I get them made + get you
to givE good Spirits to them. or let him get them made
by the maker.
10939
I should wish you not to mix yourself
up with him as he is entirely Surrounded
with Evil Spirits.
Mr. Jones has written. this letter requesting answers
to the following Questions
1st. would a C.A become the guardian of a M for me
10940
he would not.
2: Could my late wife be the Gn. of a M for me
10941
No that would not be allowEd she would
not havE the power of being a GS until
she had passed through certain Spheres
— not one to be relied upon
gn. HavE I the faculty of Seeing in a M.
10942
He will never be able to inspect.
4.
What spiritual rank has the Guardian who
acts  in me and could he be a M guardian
10943
He holds no rank he is a spirit of
[?]
the worst Kind.
5 What are my gifts as a Medium
10944
No Answer.
I think May I observE that Mr. Jones appears to
havE a holy Christian faith—& an Earnest belief in
Spiritualism — it is therefore very desirable that
176 
he should be placed in the one true path 
10945 
There are many who believe in the 
Redemption thro our Lord & Savior Jesus 
Christ, and there are many who profess 
to believe in Spiritualism but it is merely 
To show the world that they possess a 
Something more than their fellow men 
and forgetting that they are Mortal. 
May I observe that on very many occasions my 
late dear Seer Read Visions in my Crystals aromdly 
in reference to her sister Selina and her allinate 
marriage with one called by us Mr H. & Vision of 
her Children &e. were they all delusions or illusions 
10946 
They were merely given us visions to 
amuse them. not as realities had you 
not received visions or Scenes of this kind 
Your Seer would have objected to look for 
You. 
That these Visions also appeared to allude & that
pointedly to my dear Seer and her death in 
1864 may I ask by what kind of Spirits 
Such Visions & illusions were given 
10947 
They were not bad Spirits, Your Seer 
would have lived upon your Earth for 
Some short time longer but you have 
had this explained to you before. 
From the first commencement of my late dear Seer, 
inspection we have had ( to ) contained 
visits from an al Spirit known to us by the name 
of Capt Anderson. with whom we have heard very 
numerous & to me interesting Conversations. & who also 
has related to us many & irregular Spiritual occurrences 
Is he a real person. in this world I shall ( ever 
know him 
10948 
he does exist and you will meet 
177

I regret to say that I continue much bothered with
spasms & my head is exceedingly bad - but I 
hold the talisman & have your [instructions?]

10949 
had you not [wanted?] that you would
have been [?] - You must call upon
me at the times stated, it will then
have more influence.

I [refered?] to D.M. having finally given up his connection
with his Spirit friend S.J. - that his mother is
a writing medium. I was referred to the apparent
excellence of the [d?] [?comes?] so [received?]

10950 
I have given you my opinion of inviting
mediums some time back.

Mr. Jones has sent me this book entitled
"Astounding facts from the Spirit World witnessed
at the house of J. [Gridley?] Esq by a circle of
friends embracing the [expenses] of Good [?]"
May I ask your opinion of it

10951
do not put it near the Mirror

May I ask your opinion of this diagram of
the Seven Spheres.  Can you see it

10952
I can do so it is entirely false

If they are evil how can they be thus allowed 
to mislead the truly unfortunate searchers after
Truth who previous to their conversion to Spiritualism
to [have?] many of them Materialists & not having
the benefit of Spirit Guidance like your own 
have our dreams of testing them except by the
instructions given in John IV v3 -

10953
Were they strong in their belief of
Salvation through our Lord and 
Saviour Jesus Christ to pray earnestly
only for Good. No Evil  Spirits 
would then be able to rap or more 
tables and chairs at their bidding

10959
You can have a Vision 

May I ask if our [late?] friend Robert [Owen?] [wishes?] to
communicate with us or any thing to say to his son
the Hble Robert Dale [Owen?]

I have not been informed of any wish of his 
at present would your friend Lea leave the

My friend left the room & the CA gives me a 
communication from my late dear Seer [Ess?]  

20' to 9 PM

10961  The Vision

The Mirror is veiled it is different from the Veil in the
[East?] it is much handsomer, something [like very?]
splendid [Valenciennes?] lace only the flowers are
more beautiful, they appear to stand out like thick 
branches it is white all over flowers and all - its gone

Now I can see only a large piece of square
white marble now theres a little figure coming down 
all in white with wings at the end of the wings 
there appears something like a diamond now there's 
another coming down from the opposite corner B
with a kind of yellow looking stone at the 
end of its wings. they [?] their wings 
waving them gently but not spread open
as birds wings are when flying - their
dresses are all lace & very beautiful, they
have rested on the square of marble - Now
the marble is changing into what appears
a large block of chysolite white with a tinge of 
green perfectly beautiful - I did not notice that
179

Each has in its left hand a line or [?] - Now
theres a Spirit come down from C. - (the block
changed its appearance as soon as the two first
Spirits settled upon it - the Middle Spirit is
much larger his wings have opened they are
very large and beautiful and come over on front
of them, theres something on every one of the 
feathers. It has a [ship?] of something in its hand
about as wide as my finger holding it with the
fingers in both hands and the other
two Spirits are looking at the [band or ?] which
is changing and theres letters coming upon it - the
third Spirit is dressed in a white dress and a 
purple robe very like C A's - the words are

10962
"All hail to the New Year"
I have come to visit another part of the happy land

and from the two former Spirits [theres?] gone "Welcome"
There is such a difference tho both very beautiful
in their countenance - they have fair hair & [curly?]
[curls?]. The last Spirit has darker hair - now
the 3 Spirit has [hung?] the band to his left
side and the two little Spirits have taken
hold of the 3rd Spirits hands and they are rising
up

Now there is such a [l?] [grass?] [M?],
a [dozn?] miles long lined with orange trees
with the fruit upon them & blossoms also 
one tree seems all blossom and the other all
fruit it is a very beautiful sight and the three
Spirits are flying down it

Now there thousands of all those little
Spirits I saw last time some of them are not an
inch long and yet perfect in the extreme they
they have wreaths of flowers and especially roses
of all colors hanging in festoons one to the other
the flowers are so beautiful they look [p?]
the little Spirits are now all going as rapidly 
as they came and only the three are left, they 
are flying up the grove, they look so lovely
and beautiful now they ve come back & the groves
gone. Now the 3rd Spirit is gone and only the 
first two left - now they are gone also -

10' to 9 PM The Vision

10971
   The Mirror's veiled, the ground work 
is of very fine lace with figures all over it - all the
figures are Angels like Cupids in different attitudes
This veil hangs down in folds - Theres a splendid
light come at the back of it - its all gone (3')
   There something coming in the middle 
its the square block of marble, the side facing 
me has flowers upon it - it has folding doors 
which have opened and there's splendid flowers on
the inside of each door - they are flowers of precious 
stones of all colors and shine brilliantly and 
the inside is made to match & form like a
little room. Now the top part's raised a little
and it is painted on the top with figures of 
Angels - the inside of the top - The outside is  
like a large precious stone.
   There's the same figure which I saw
before which came down upon it - Now theres
7 small spirits not longer than ones finger they 
are inside the room 3m one side and 4m
the other - the first has walked into the
middle of the room and knelt down and put
his hand up he has  2 rings on one hand
and one on the other he is kneeling down facing 
me, the face a little up—Now the little spirits are 
Kneeling & their little hands up their hands do not 
seem larger than a finger nail 
Now there are two more coming out at the back not so large as the S Spirit Yet larger than 
the others I can see their wings plainer than the 
others they are in white robes and they hold up 
their robes in their hands as tho’ they were
bringing something in it where’s a band gone 
from each of the two last—spirits. 
10,972 
"I have brought you this reward for thou
art faithful"
They have all rose from their knees and the first 
Spirits have taken flowers out of the laps of the 
other two he has 3 flowers in one hand and 
two in the other and the last two spirits have 
gone there are small ribbons on each bouquet 
and on it “Faith” one of the 4 Spirits inside 
has come in front and turned his back to me 
now the top of the room has fallen back and the 
doors have fallen back and the little spirits 
have risen up level to where the ceiling was 
So that they are as high as the first Spirit 
they have suddenly taken a flying position 
they are all going up the Children carry up 
the flowers so that they hang over the 1st Spirit 
Now his wings open so beautiful—they are all 
going—the room goes up with them the Spirits 
are gone and the lids fallen [up] over again the 
doors have closed the bright appearance has gone 
off and its turned like a block of marble again 
Its all gone 8’ past 9 PM

Invoked the C A

The C A appeared as usual

As to my head [&c?]

10973
You must still continue to do so

I hope my Seers sight will be strengthened so that she 
may receive the [comm?] I so much covet

10974
Your Seers sight will be wonderfully 
[improved?] in a very short time, it looks to
me as if it was the [present?]

My dear Seer promised to appear in Feb as I do
not intend calling - I must request you to advise me
of the time.

10975
I will inform you when she will appear

May we have a vision this evening

10976
That will depend entirely upon the 
[time?] the Cards will occupy.
I would complete the Cards as you
wish it, this evening if possible.

[If my?] [&c?]

10977
I also wish that should you feel a 
faintness come over you in the street
or any other place to make a mark 
across you chest in this direction

(the CA did it with his left hand)

10978
In no way 
forget to do this

Am I to use any words or merely call upon you
[*this came in [c?]*]

10979
You have only to say the word
"Trust"
If there is any thing you wish to 
ask inform me & it can be so

We then received the communications [required?] which
[occupied?] til 1/4 past 9 - and then upon
[asking?] if we could be favored with a vision
there came

10980

I think indeed I know that it would be 
better for her not to inspect any longer
tonight - with your leave I will take my 
leave.

Invoked the C.A.

I do not see the slightest doubt.
You will find yourself so much better in 
London.

As to our seeing the 4 book

10982
All will be done for you that can in
due time.

Lt. Mackenzie has written me this [?] & also an address
to his G.S. --  [?] [?] he cannot        it
develope his Light  he is extremely anxious for me to

to answer all those questions to his 
satisfaction all I can say to him is as [?]
GS. that he should remain strong in faith
to [?] at the time appointed for him

to inspect his Mirror and he will then
succeed but he must not be dull at
having wasted 2 years when you have
studied so many years and only been 
able to communicate through another
with the Spirit World so few out of so
many and then in the end he will
have the power of inspecting for himself

As I shall [now?] shortly commence preparing for my
leaving [Croyden?] & my friend is also preparing to 
lessons I shall not be able to ask the questions
I wish till I am once more settled.

10986

I shall not address you till you have
left and are residing in London.
I will have then some instructions
to lay down for you.

When you have left the house 
kindly dismiss every Spirit you have 
called while residing there.

And when you enter your new 
lodgings call upon me.

10987   The Vision

Here is a different curtain, its a white net
with gold stripes, its fallen down quick, I can see
only a [the] large Square [Solid] piece of [marble] white
something like white [calico?], [its?] gradually falling 
back very slowly - now its curled all up like a 
wreath of smoke and left such a beautiful square of
glass under it an immense piece splashed all over
with spots - They are trees like a beautiful word
I can see a figure in the distance but an immense
way off as tho miles distant, yet I can see it has
a book and looks as though weeping, it has the
book up to its eyes, it has no wings  it's gradually
coming this way walking in and out of the trees
All the trees appear to be moving as well as the
figure - Now I can see more walking, there are
three more only they are holding these books in both
hands, the first figure has one hand up as though
weeping  They are still moving on trees and all
as though bringing another part of the wood up to
the glass, the trees are very beautiful, of many
different kinds, now there numbers of figures there
are 14 of them  I can see another figure that has
wings, it is sitting but I cannot see upon what
there a crook on staff at the side of the sitting
figure, a wreath of leaves around its head, the wings
do not come up over it's head, it has a plain white 
dress and a pink band toward the waist, no letters or
[?], the walking figures are going towards it.

Now the sitting spirit has got up and
is walking  it was sitting on an ivory pillar very
beautifully carved.  like the Chinese carvings   all
the other figures are standing around in a semicircle
with the Angel in the centre  the others are mortals
with loose garments and books, they fall in around
the waist but have no bands, now they are all
kneeling  I can not see their faces, which are as tho
purposely hidden  Some have light and others
dark hair

The angel is walking toward them
he has looked on all their books with such precision
almost all at the same moment  he is now
dividing them  he has sent 3 to the first one
the rest he has directed to the other side of
the Glass  a  [illustration] through the trees   he waved
his staff and they are gone  he has turned
his back and come to the [?], b,  and sent them
among the trees on this side and now there's
some words gone between them

10988  "Tarry a little while and shall return"
its all going, its getting faint   its gone

As to my leaving Croydon

Invoked the C A

11010
Let it be so you can now ask what 
is most important to yourself and I 
will give you my opinion 

11011
I trust that you will be able and I am 
sure that you will cease communication
in this form for your worldly welfare
but other times you will leave as 
usual

11012
That I would wish only to be known 
to yourself, there were often opportunities
for me to do so before but I could 
not.

11013
I should prefer your coming before Xmas
it will be much better for your health and
help lead to your benefit that you 
should be here.
11014 
But her End will be peace -------
It will be a work of time -------
11015
I do use all my influence with her. --
but I am happy to inform from you she has
shaken off all bad feelings to any mortal
upon your earth and when she has reached
that state of happiness it may please God 
to call her to ------------------------
she will be able to appear three times
before leaving this Earth.
11016 
her appearing only leaves her nearer to that
State of bliss which it is the wish of all
to obtain.
11017
You may do so
11018
I would wish ---- I have a great wish -----
it is with respect for yourself with your
Employer.  You had done wrong with respect
to raising objections to your friend Lea going
to the office, it has so added to your
benefit. he is a man who does not forget
and it would have been to your advantage
if he had been, for you are about to have
a severe illness.
11019
It was a pity your Seer lead that which
was not placed before her, but she now
sees the folly of having an ill feeling
towards any person.

You may not see the propriety of my
tennet.
11021
I have no idea of time I can see that this
This is about to occur and I think it my 
duty to apprize you of it.

11022
I allow you to be the best judge of all these
circumstances, being a moral and at the
same time you must exonerate your
friend Lea from doing any thing shabby 
from one mortal to another he would not
if he was to suffer any thing that a mortal
could suffer.

11023
I have a ask that you should not write
another article for publication after the
one you are about to write until I inform 
you may do so.

11024
It is my wish, not but what I should like
all these wishes brought before man for 
his benefit but your Employer Mr Bigbie
has a very great objection to these sciences

I was aware of that & had I known for it 
was my wish that brought my __________[*?*]

Mrs. Charlotte Lea. Spex

1/4 to 9 PM

Invoked the C. A. 

The C. A. is here

My dear & kind Guardian Angel, agreeably to your 
instructions, having taken up my residence in London
I take this the first opportunity of Invoking you
and I hope the place I have selected for the
Mirror will meet your approval

[10989] 11030 

I do not like it here it is too near the 
Sheet -
If you were across the room I should 
then be able to say that the place will do

I will then remove it at once if you wish me to do so

[10990] 11031

Where you are will do you need not
remove the Mirror for this Evening

The formula you so kindly gave me 
to relieve my head I have now used for some
Bequest of
Harry Houdini
April 1927
weeks past with much benefit and intend continuing
to do so
[crossed out 10991]
11032
You need only do it til I appear again
and then I will give you a seal that 
you must wear in your hat for a short 
time and then I think you will be
perfectly restored.

11033
[crossed out 10992]
When will you favor me with it 
Next Tuesday M Lea will be calling for
himself it must be today first night
I thank you when will it be convenient for you to
favor me with your advice as to my future -
[crossed out 10993]
11034
On my next appearance.
I must beg you to excuse my apparent impatience
but I am exceedingly anxious to receive your fourth
book that I may get the whole work ready for
the press as soon as possible, when will my present
Seer be capable of accessing it.
11035
[crossed out 10994] 
That you will access in due time
I had already promised it to you
But from my arrangement I shall only be able to
Access it every other Tuesday.
11036
[crossed out 10995]
I have no doubt that I will be able to
appear to you more often than once a 
fortnight as it is a hobby  your friend 
Lea covets as much as yourself.
I now wish to inspect your new
apartment for which purpose you must
go into them, calling strongly upon me
standing first upon the landing outside
this noon and call upon me then
enter your bed room and call strongly
and I shall be with you 
Now I wish you to place your hand upon
the mirror 
offer up a prayer to Him who is the 
disposer of all humankind and you will have
done all that I shall require of you 
As I went across the room the seers remarked
there appeared as I neared the door the words
"Honor. Health. Happiness and faith in the most
High" and a strong ray of light proceeded from
the C A in the mirror along with me remaining,
Whilst I was out of the room. I again being [?]
as I returned when the C A said

[109997 crossed out]
11037
On my leaving this room I shall rest
then and that will be sufficient 
If I am again unwell shall I use the formula 

[10998 crossed out]

Yes call upon me and I shall be there 
Shall I take the mirror with me into the other 
room

8:15 PM        C. A Mirror      Mr. Sea Spex
Invoked the CA
The CA is here.
Accepting thanks for having appeared so readily to my
Call. This is the being appointed by you to give
me the instructions necessary for my guidance in
spiritual matters.
[10999 crossed out] 11040 Ask any Question You Wish
The Seer here remarked that the CA appeared to have
[?yl]-a cloud over her right Eye, which had pained
her much during the last 2 or 3 days.
The Formula
I am very much unsettled in my mind as to my
future communications with you. I am not [sure?] if it will
be convenient and agreeable for my present seer to speculate
for me and I wish to ask you as to my testing the powers
of a young person who from Certain causes cannot be named
and who I think to make a very desirable seer [?]
my late dear seer made an assertion which I feel
can never be realized.
11041  I don't wish you to [?} any one for at
least 3 months, and above all do not
[11000 crossed out] allow the people of the house to know
any thing of this matter, at all, at all, and
with respect to any remark your late 
seer may have made, spirits are not
the dispatchers of mans destiny and therefore
Cannot foretell future Events.
I thank you I will continue for the next three
months & call only to my present seer - when it said

5
When it suits her convenience
1104[2]1
I don't think they will have the
slightest [convenience] objection
I am very thankful to say that since you gave me
the formula my head has been so much better that
I really feel quite a different person, Are you aware
that I call upon you night + morning.

11042
I am aware of it.
Every thought you have in respect to me
I know almost before it enters your own
mind.
There is one thing I wish to mention
I am anxious to appoint a spirit of a lesser
order to be with you and direct you on
your daily transactions as by him I should
be made acquainted with your inner world if
matters connected with yourself through
him then I could otherwise be.
My new G.S. you are  I feel sure well aware that
I have now for some years Entirely placed myself
under your guidance  in every thing connected with
my Spiritual affairs and if you wish it I can
hear no objection to any Spirit  you might appoint as
I should then look to you alone for my Spiritual
Guidance support and a God's mercy.

11043
He would have no power over you other
than I allowed him.
If I was to allow any Evil to come about
You  I should cease to be that which I am
appointed for. A servant of the most High
and a constant watcher over my charge.

May I ask his name and our duties to each other

11044  On a future evening I should like him to
appear before you came to the Conclusion
whether you will have him attend you or
not.

Will he appear this day fortnight if my Seer's able
to inspect for me.

11045  He will

May I ask if you have any advice to give me as to my
conduct betwixt this time - & that

11046  I have not, only be careful in not spending
Your money rashly upon any thing, and
Keeping yourself for the next six weeks [from]
as free from entering into Company as you
can for the next 6 weeks and I think 
then your health will be sufficiently
restored for you to do any thing you wish.

I will endeavor to follow your advice as closely as
possible.

11047  It is for your benefit I speak thus.
Your Seer is on the point of returning
to her natural state.
              ____________________

My Seer who was not aware of any change having taken
place in respect to herself = came to her normal state.
May I observe that this is the Evening You Kindly
promised to give me a talisman to wear for the benefit
of my health.  may I ask you to favor me with it now
that my Seer may copy it & enable me to make a
fair copy preparatory to your impregnating it when
you next appear.
11048  J Mill
Now that CA has held his left hand up the seal is in 
the palm of his hand about the size of a shilling 
my Seer then copied it and  I requested the CA to remain
until I had completed my copy that he might see if it was
correct Previous to my preparing the one for him to impregnate
on Tuesday week

110409
do so but I do not see that it is necessary for me
to stay as it is sufficiently impressed upon your
Seers memory for her to guide you in making it
I will then prepare it ready [for?] your appearance on Tuesday
fortnight when I hope to have the pleasure of again calling
you.

11050 
do so and may the blessing of the most High
Rest upon you
The C.A.'s gone

odie May 14. 1849
6 am
[8 10 pm]  Invoked the C. A.
The CA is here
As I am uncertain whether I shall be in London or
at Poole on Tuesday next my friend Mr. Lea will
inspect for me this evening may I ask if the seal
I have prepared and will now place ag the M(irror) is
sufficiently correct

11057
It is

Now there's a beam of light gone from the C.A. to the
seal and these words
 
11052
Place the seal upon the part of your head
affected
8

I did so & the Seer said theres a ray of light gone to the 
Seal upon your head - Now the CA's said

11053
That will do - place it on the [?] you intend
for it and fix it inside your hat then place
your hat about 4 inches from the Mirror 

I did so

11054
That will do. Theres another word to go
on the plain side of it
Protect.
It is not only as a protection for your head 
but to keep you from those fainting fits 
in the Street.

When I return from Poole I hope to commence a series
of questions relative to the interesting subject of
Atmospheric Spirits, a subject upon which I have 
required so many responses - Yet have so much to learn
but may I ask if we can be favored with one of
thine Spiritual Visions so delightful to the Seer &
interesting to us all.

11055
I think as Mr. Leas eyes are affected 
You had better not inspect for a too lengthened 
period this evening.

I thank you I will not then request a Vision may I
ask if you have any further advice to give me if I do
not "call" again before I leave London

11056
I have done all I can for your protection

In respect to the enquirers as to Atmospheric Spirits
of saving mortals and their laws & relation to [?]
Shall I enquire of you or the Spirit you mentioned 
being about to appoint to me.

11057

He will appear, you can question him
and you will judge for yourself
I thank you as that the whole of my spiritual dealings 
in your hands I shall receive any spirit you may 
appoint with all due respect and courtesy, the only fear 
I have is lest this his being appointed, you may not 
take that kind virtues in one you have hitherto done 
and for which I am so happy to acknowledge & [honor?] so 
much.
11058
Do not fear that for a moment I should 
cease to be your Guardian Spirit were I to do 
so, but do not for one moment think 
I should be offended if you did not accept my 
offer, it must be for you to decide
As one of my seer's eyes is affected by a cold I will
will not [?] it by requesting a vision and the [?] so 
as my friend Lea may wish to call his GS.  [Ellermo?]
when he returns home.
11059
[Ellesimo?] will not appear at M Lea's home 
this evening for I knew of M Lea's coming 
here and [Ellesino?] was acquainted with it 
I returned thanks the C A left

C.A.M.

Invoked the C.A. 

The CA is here 

My dear & kind G.S. as since the decease of my beloved Seer
ESS. my opportunities for communing with you have been
and are likely to continue comparatively limited. I 
feel the urgent necessity there is of making according to my 
humble abilities the most of the opportunity afforded me
by preparing my questions before hand under different 
leads and with your permission I will this evening ask 
some questions in reference to "Atmospheric Spirits" - 

11070
You can do so

The Subject of "Atmospheric Spirits " of living mortals is 
a most interesting one to Spiritualists and although 
Emanuel Swedenborgs statement concerning them (   )
has been so long published and it bears so strongly upon
the Marvels of Mesmeric Clairvoyance in their Trance
[handling?] and discourses, it is surprising no [elucidation?]
has yet been offered by any investigator of Spiritualism
I am therefore very desirous with your kind permission 
to receive from you in addition to the information already
so kindly furnished to me replies to the following questions
and I will first state the conclusions I have arrived 
at from the responses you have so kindly favored me 
with

11061
do so

That every mortal born on this Earth has from the
Commencement of his existance  a Spiritual Representation
in the World of Spirits the exact counterpart of
himself in form feature, & dress as shown so often
11

in our Crystals & Mirrors distinguished in our [commentions?]
by the term "Atmospheric Spirits." is that so

11092
You are quite right

That these Atmospheric Spirit of living mortals are at our 
birth born into the Spirit World, grow with our growth and
become from infancy to old age the receptacle of our
thoughts, the partakers of our knowledge, and the Spiritual
record of our actions, in fact as complete a counterpart
of our intellectual knowledge & faculties as they are 
of our corporeal form. is that so

11093
You are quite right

That when we mortals leave this Earth when our bodies
from dust return to dust and we live no longer in time
but in eternity that this [At.?] Spirit becomes the
Spiritual Covering or embodiment of the Soul supplying 
the place of our Earthly covering yet preserving our
perfect individual identiti.

11094
It is quite right

[Of the state when our mortal Soul thus united
with its Spiritual body eases into the [At?] World
"the World of Shadows"]

That when an immortal Soul thus becomes clothed
and united with its Spiritual Covering it [?] back 
or another becomes instantly cognizant of all the thoughts
the ideas the knowledge and the memory of its past
actions good & bad, during its [moo?] lengthened life in
the corporeal body vividly and distinctly becoming in fact
its own living witness, its own sad page in the book of life.

11095
It is quite right - they are your counterpart and
are answerable for all your actions upon your Earth
12

Of the state when our invisibal soul thus united with
its spiritual body enters into the At world, the world of 
Shadows - at first [able] scarcely able to realize the fact
that it is no longer of the earth, Earthly, & enters upon
its new existence you have already informed me in your
Esteemed & much valued work on Spiritual & metaphysical
Philosophy, I will now with your permission seek an
Elucidation of those points which at present - so much
perplex[es] us and I will remark that these questions
relate alone to the At Spirits of living mortals.

11066   do so.

When upon calling the At Spirit of a living person
into the C or M  it appears in the precise [?]
of its mortal form and replies to our questions.  Can 
we be certain that it is in all cases, the real At Spirit
of the individual desired and not a form assumed by
an evil or wandering Spirit for its own purposes.

11067   Evil Spirits could take that form, but unless they 
were very Evil, they would not dare to do so 
but you can always know by its holding
of its palm.

here the C A. held up his right hand
How are we to tell them from Evil, then 

11068  by the mark that is placed thereon

I would not willingly  [answer] ask any question that you
would not wish to answer, but should I do so. I know
you will pardon it 

11069   I would remain silent upon a subject
that ought not to be answered by one
 
I presume it is a distinctive mark Each AS. has individually

It is
13

Evil spirits I presume then are not able to show my marks

110[3]70   they are not.

May I ask how it is that when I have called my own
At Spirit with the Crystal, although his personal identity
has been perfect, yet so far from appearing to have the 
same earnest desire for spiritual knowledge as myself
he has either annoyed me by his frivolity, or opposed 
my views and endeavored to lead into connexion with Evil
Spirits as Orion and ---- who offered me the diamond 

110[3]71   No answer

Have I made myself understood

110[3]72   You have made yourself understood
When calling your At Spirit again request
him to appear as you now are -
If when calling him [as you now are and]
you ask him to appear as you now are - 
and he appears as you are now. his thoughts
will be the same as yours. - but when he has
appeared hitherto he has borrowed your
costume and appeared to you as of days gone by.

but had I not previously recieved your kind advice
& precepts for my guidance into what mischief might
my AtS. have led me.

110[3]73   I should cease to be your GS.  were I to allow
him to do any thing wrong either as to your 
worldly welfare or your welfare hereafter.
[*qu?*]
Only to the end of obtaining Good

It is surprising that by apparently so simple a Formula
---- Would have so readily given me the diamond

110[3]74  It was a sacrifice and you have no right
14

to sacrifice any thing that was not sent
for mans use on this Earth

But by what possible means could my At Sps. have then
become acquainted with . . . . .

11075
It could not have been your At Sp. it must
have been a form of Evil

But . . . . . offered if I would do this, he would leave me
the diamond at once in any vessel of water with as my 
apparent A S said many "ten pounds" do you think
then Spirits could have done so

11076

They could and had you have sacrificed that
You must have sacrificed other things for him
I should be obliged as your Guardian
Spirit to leave you for a time were you to
make a sacrifice of any kind -
I should return to my charge after a time
but it would be with great difficulty

By what mark shall I know my At Sp.

11077
I have answered that before
At Spirits all have their duties to perform
but it is as I have just informed you towards
a good end. it is nothing worldly

May I ask if we can be favored with a Vision
this evening if agreeable to you

11078
It is agreeable it [rests?] with her whether
she thinks her eyes will hold out long enough

Mrs. Lea [?] her Sight declined the Vision

[Action?] ended.

[?] die July 12 1859

1/4 to 9 PM.   CA Mirror   Mr. Lea Spex

Invoked the C.A. 

The CA is here

My dear kind GS. from many [chances?] I have been presented 
calling you to my great regret but I have solicited
your appearance this evening as it will be the last
one I shall be able to commence with you as I go to 
Northumberland on Saturday next.

 11079
I should like to appear again because I 
would give you a small protection to take
with you that could be destroyed on your
return.

I thank you I have no doubt my Seer Mr. Lea will
oblige me by inspecting on Friday next if you will
then appear

11080
I will do so

I now remember Friday is Mr. Lea's music night
perhaps you will kindly appear on Thursday instead

11081
I would prefer it being on Friday 

My [Seeress?] will then inspect for me and I will take this
[M?] to her house as Mr. Lea will probably wish to call his 
GS in his M, as I should not dare to detain you
long

11082
It would only be to impregnate that which 
I should give you

My [Seeress?] [very?] kindly says she will come here so that
I shall then be able to call you here as usual without
disturbing the M

11083
I would prefer doing so as the [M] influences
would be greater & more lasting 
16

Since I have been prevented calling you and holding
that communion so continuously as I used to do, are
you aware that I the more earnestly provoke your
C A time in my nightly [?] prayers; that is
immediately after them.

11084
I am and when you are out of town I should
wish you to continue to do so

I thank you I will do so and rely as hitherto on your
kind and watchful guidance

11085
but I also wish while you are away, that 
you should be careful with respect to your
mode of living, you must not take too much
fruit - and be guarded carefully in all 
your sections

I thank you I will be cautious indeed I have been most
careful in respect to G C B

11086
It is with respect to him that you have to
study and him only.

I hope his friendship for me will continue as kind
as it has hitherto been - I owe him much & esteem
him greatly.

11087
It will do so, do not fear, I only throw
these out as remarks, I may say cautions
for your good.

I thank you much I will follow out your kind 
counsel

11088
If Mr Lea would oblige by leaving the room
I would speak with you

Mr Lea having left the room
17

The CA then gave me a [drawing of a hand/palm] formula and said
Now you can ask any question you wish.
I used the formula & the Seers without being aware of it
"passed over" and [?] the much [?] advice and
I [?] on my return to give me a formula to health
the [?] that bound my late dear Seer to me.
          The CA at length said Your Seer is suffering
in her hopes? Service? the formula & she will return
to her normal state. - I did so and my Seers
"Came over" as the waking from a Slumber. I was quite
unconscious of every thing which had passed.

Shall I now release my Seer from Seeing any longer
but the CA said the most for a Short time
allow Lea then returned with the loom

25' past 9 PM.
Will you now kindly favor me with the “protection” 
promised 
Now the CA with the left hand appeared to lift a silver 
Cord the raising of which seemed to open the dress the 
inside of which appeared [???]like but indescribably 
beautiful—& the Seal of which the Seer made a copy 
Was n the under part of the CA’s left heel. which the 
CA lifted up for the purpose of Showing it & my 
Seers made a rough copy which the C.A said was 
Sufficiently correct for me to make mine under my seers
Friday to impregnate it the CA left. 
Action Ended
18

5' to 9   [?]die 15 July 1859   6 AM

Invoked the CA

The CA is here

I have made the seal to the best of my ability. I hope
it meets your approval.

11089
It is correct

May I ask the purpose for which it is specially intended

11090
It is for safety while on travel
a safety against your making any
indiscreet remarks
a protection against those faintings you suffer
from.
In short to protect you from any evil
influence

Shall I place it against the M[irror] for you to verify it

11091 
I will not impregnate it yet

May I ask if you have any observations to make 
prior to my asking any questions

11092
I have

My friend Mr. Lea left the room and I [said?] the 
formula and the seer "passed over"

May I ask to what subject you wish to allude

11093
It is with respect to your employer and
the difference that he has with you.
he is at a loss to understand why
you are so friendly with your friend 
Lea, and yet you refuse him a seat
in his office - he will never rest till 
he has found out this, it has been a 
great injury in his mind towards you
but it ever remains with you to be
the best judge

I explained to the CA. the reason at great length

11094
But it is a great [truly?] your [Seer?] was
wrong, it would remove an impression
x       if Mr. Lea did not object -- and then any way Mr. 
[Bliuded?]. I should be quite satisfied with 
"let it be so"
19

that he cannot at all unfathom

I stated I had no objection to state the whole affair 
to Mr. B. - x [etc.?] x

11095
do not allow your Seer to know what 
passes She is a woman who feels her 
position too much.

I shall while away as usual call upon you eight
and [moving?] and I hope still to claim your
kind influence and that you will be with me
when &c.

11096
I shall be too happy

Shall I now place the Seal against the Mirror

11097
No raise the Seers hand

I did so from her lap to about level with the M

11098
place the Seal in her hand

[There?] placed the Seal as directed & the Seers hand which
which was cold and pulseless then moved to abt.
9 inches from the Mirror and in a few moments the
CA said

11099
It is done.
take it out of your Seers hand my
influence on it is complete

How am I to wear it

11100 
Place it in your sock

do you mean next my foot

11101
I do

Will you kindly impregnate these other seals
especially this for my head from which I have 
[received?] such [signal?] benefit. I will place them 
ags. the Mirror

11102
It is done

Will you favor my Seer with a Vision [or should my
Seer]
 
11103
I think your Seer had better not

My Seer complains of great numbness in her
on die 8 Aug 1859 being in Nottingham I took the opportunity
of visiting Mr. J.G.H. Brown "the [S?] Prophet" the author 
of a number of pamphlets on Spiritual subjects & predictions off.
thru the Crystal - I found that he [?] [blend?] of [CM?] - [?]
could see in the C better then when his [eyesight?] [?]
& he gave the following [a?] of his Seership - 

In the year 1848 he had heard this a relative much
[?] to a man of the name of      [?] visions in Crystals
& mirrors - & one Sunday when [he]     was in the home of his
relative he went in "his [?] & pipe in mouth" just
[to expose?] the [Ch?] - on the

11104
No. That will pass away.
I then used the formula and my Seven returned
to her normal State.

Invoked the CA.
CAM.
The CA is here.
My dear and Kind CA. I havE taken this the first
opportunity of Calling you Since y return from
[Al??ick] I regret to say that Circumstancs
prevented my following your advice so closely as I
ought to havE done. and the Change of living has
brought back all my symptoms and I havE
been obliged to reduce myself again as quickly
as possible & I still feel exceedingly unwell.
11105
You must not take any more medicines
You are destroying taht taht does not
belong to you
11106
I wished You to be careful while you
were away. and had I not a strong
reason I should not havE impressed
that so Strongly upon your mind
And had I not givEn you that Telesm
You would have been far worse.
I now wish that destroyed.
the Seer here upon said Now theres some lines &
might be allowed to appear, that the spirits by whom the 
past [?] discourses were given had then & have since
Cont. to appear.- but his Eyesight gradually failing
 him- he at lenght became quite blind & for [6 months?] 
gave up all thoughts of inspecting- but one day at the 
suggestion of a friend he was induced to inspect & found 
he could see as well as ever better than before and 
the pamphlets now before the [World?] are the result.-  
he had read [a?]- [?] & [d?] but did 
not appear much versed in the subject. of astrology he 
knew worthy. he gave me his time =
21
and Characters Come and the CA has taken the Seal
from which yours was Copied and turned the back of
it towards me and these Characters are upon it.

11107
I wish those placed upon the Talisman
I then Copied them upon the back and asked if
they were Correct.

11108
That will do
What am I now to do

11109
I now wish You to burn it and as you
burn it repeat
"May this ill health and all Evil leave
with the Consuming of this"
I then did so as far as possible [in?] the point of my
Knife in the Candle , the Talisman being made upon
Vellum. Still it was reduced to a Cinder —-
I have burned it

11110
I am aware of it and may the
blessing of our Father be with thee
Go and make a hole in the garden
& bury it, I will wait your return.
I then went into Mr Leas Garden I buried it about
2 1/2 feet in the ground and returned & informed the CA
I hope under your Care I shall now get better
1112
I made you acquainted Some time
back that you would havE an illness
I may be able for a time to put that
by but it must come on at last.
I should advise you to Eat a little
more meat than you do, but to take
less drink.
I will do so I need not add how sincerely I
thank you for all your kind Solicitude on my
behalf. I feel sure you are well aware how much
I thank you.
22
11113
I am aware of it and only wish I could 
do more for you 
While you [were?] away I hope all other
things succeeded as you wished
I thank you- yes- I explained all I wished to Mr B 
and I hope and think I've [?] of possible [?] [?]
friends than her.

11114 
This well
If Mr Lea is well enough I hope to call you 
next Tuesday if it will be agreeable from me 
to do to this always agreeable to me to do so

11115 
It's always agreeable to me to appear
although I can't say lately it has
been informative --
perhaps my friend Mr Lea may wish to call 
[Effesino?] this evening  can he do so.

11116
I think you had better not call any 
more. 
I have a reason for it=

Invoked the C.A.
the CA is here
unfortunately the Telesm you gave me for any head 
to wear inside my hat has been out of my possession 
and I have suffered very much may request 
you again to place your influence upon it

11117
I will do so, peace of at the bottom 
of the mirror
It is done
I'm sorry to say that I have been suffering 
very much from wind and spasms but shall mine

from the excessive heaviness of the right side of my brain
unfortunately Mr. G my new doctor has been taken ill
in the [family] & I had thought of going to [Dr?] Epps 
the Homeopathist & [hoping?] if he can do any thing
for it.

11118 
No medical man can assist you 
with that. that is why I gave you
this seal
you must do as I have before told 
you to do, take things more patiently
and be not so excitable
I will impregnate this Seal every
last Tuesday in the month for you
beyond that I can do no more

[Mr GCD.?]

11119
on this subject I will speak at a future
time

You [mentioned?] some time since your wish to introduce
another Spirit to me that would understand my
worldly affairs better. I could acquaint you [therewith?]
but allow me to say - I have no wish for any other
[ad?] but yourself. - I only mention this as it is was
your expressed wish.

11120
I will inform you when he will appear 
on another occasion.

You also mentioned my late beloved Seer would appear

11121 
we will not speak of her now, it
must be at another time
I had wished to speak of her but
it must be in a state that you are
aware of --

I thank you I will make the necessary arrangements
May I ask if my Seer can be favored with me
of those vision which interests us all so much 

11122
I should be most happy to do so
24
but as she is [?] engaged  
I think we had better just shut off
My seer says she is discouraged just now  If you 
will permit us to have a vision

I think you had better wait

odie 13th Sept. 1859.      [???] Terrace
5 past 8 .
Invoked the C. A.
The CA is here.
May I observe that on Sunday the 4 Sept. I followed my friend
Mr [?]to the grave. his affairs are very perplexing and 
I think of placing them in the hands of a Solicitor & letting
them take their usual course

11124
I think you had best do so and it will 
take a great deal of trouble off your own shoulders.-
You must not be as I have before informed you so excitable
& place his affairs with a Windsor of London Sol.[icitor]

11125 
If you intend to watch the proceedings 
you had better put it in the hands of 
the one most accessible to yourself. 
Mr MacKenzie has written me this letter will you 
favor me with your advice as to his Spiritual Vision

11126
I have advised him and so has [???] 
to cease having any dealings with  
Writing Spirits and he had better not
[?] the writing as they are [?] but
he does not go the right way to have
that power (crystsalology) given him which
he so much abuses.
I thank you I will mention what you say and not
trouble myself further about it.
25

11127
It will be much better for you

I will let him take my own [?], there are reasons why
I do not wish to [combine?] the acquantance

11128
Of this as a mortal you must be the best 
judge - but I do not wish it

May I ask when I am to call the Spirit you wished 
to introduce to me but let me observe I only ask this 
question to meet your wishes on my part I have 
no desire to seek information from any but yourself

11129
I have appointed him to watch over 
you and from him I know much, I
thought you had a disinclination so I
employed him [as?] my [?] but he
can appear if you wish it tonight 
fortnight

Will you favor me with his name that I may 
call him accordingly

11130
After I have left the Mirror he will
appear on tonight fortnight

Can you tell me whether Mohamed Ali who made
drawings of the Nimrod plates (      )
which I showed him will appear again & explain them 

11131 
The time does not seem far distant to
me

do you mean when he will appear

11132
I do

May I ask if you have any objection to my having
a [p?] made like my box Mirror to take to Mr
Leas house, when I wish to call you as I wish to
have this one fitted up in a different manner, of course
the new M(irror) would be dedicated & kept entirely under
your charge & direction as this is.

11133
Then I could not raise the slightest 
objection

May I ask as my Seers sight so much improves
26

improves when I shall be favored with the much
coveted 4 books of your Metaphysical & Spiritual
Philosophy.

11134
All those will be granted & given to you
in due time

Although I was much astonished to see my future
Seer Ellen Agnes grown so tall for such a
young child yet it will be a long time before she
can be of any service to me as a Seer.

11135
Not so long as you might anticipate

but it must be some years before she is of any
service as she has not yet begun to learn her letters

11136
It will astonish you how quick she 
will be able to do so

May I ask if you are aware how the S Monk
progresses now I am unable to continue the MS.
he expressed so anxious a desire to be relieved of

11137
He is far happier than he was. Especially
as far as that MS has been done.
but until that is carried out he cannot
gain that happiness. he wishes to
obtain.

Can I call him on a Friday

11138
I will answer that question another time

Whilst I was thinking of a question my Seer said 
then something else - its

11139
All will go well with you after your 
Seer has appeared

I will ask Mrs. Lea's to call her next Tuesday
evening which I will devote entirely to my [p?]
questions so that on future eve's my friend Lea 
may join us

11140
I would rather you called her on a
Friday

I will then with your permission call her on ♀ week
It appears by the response that this was kindly 
effected by the CA to [prevent/present?] her seeing the spirit 
of her friend who had died the same morning &
was then in the room with us.

Mr Many 
Lees died 1 Nov. 1859 20' past 7 am
aged 53 on the 13 next January.
buried on a Saturday 5 Nov. at Abney Park Cemetery 
He was very  intimate friend who was related to my seer
27
It can be so, it had better be so, I don't
rush to leave if you had any request or
[*11141*]question to note, but I have business of 
importance to attend to and if you could
share me I should be obliged.
May we be favored with a vision
with me because I
[*11142*] It would interfere with me because I
could not bear while it was here.
The CA left

♀ dte Oct. 7. 1859.
This evening was dedicated Entirely to my [?]
with my late beloved seer. & We had the happiness of
seeing her receive her first dress.

1st Nov. 1859 Wilton Terrace
10' past 8pm. CAM
Invoked the C. A 
The CA is here in white dress Purple Robe Crown Wings 
&e as Usual 
Just before the C A appeared my Seer remarked 
“This Evening as soon as I sat down to the Mirror & before it Veiled my face went all over as though 
I was dead with my Eyes fixed and unable to see 
any thing but now the CA is here, and at 
this moment the Seer said “I am going quite 
sleepy, I feel quite fatigued & without the formula 
She passed over—she then slowly read the responses 
following & at 20’ past 9 on returning—[she's a] dear 
Me I am very sleepy the CA is is learning 
of come she knew nothing of what had passed
28

I explained that not having been able to call Tuesday
I had at home used the M(irror) and asked if the CA
was aware to what I had refered to on that evening.

11143
No answer

May I ask if when I am not able to communicate thro
my Seer -- and I use the M in the same manner will
you appear there altho not visible to me so as to hear
what I wish to say

11144
You can do that without the Mirror

but I do so every night & morning I am so strongly
impressed that I shall have to give up my [commn.?]
with you through my present Seer and I need not 
say the anxiety it has caused me.

11145
I do not think there is any occasion
for you to do so
I do not think you will do so, or have
any reason for your doing it.
I think you place little faith in me
after what passed at my last appearance

but my Seer informs she will shortly be engaged
on Thursdays & Friday Evenings and as you decline 
appearing on any other evening of course my commn.
must come thro my present Seer.

11146
She will not be engaged on Tuesdays.

Your remark appears unkind because I feel
convinced you must be aware how sincerely and
implicitly my faith is placed in you to whom
I owe so much

11147
You will not lose this so dispel
all fears at once

I thank you I am indeed pleased to hear it
and will endeavor to banish all thoughts [?]
from my mind until any other circumstance
should take place on my Seers [p?] which I
will [armed calely?] acquaint you with.
29
11148
If I was not your Guardian Spirit I should
not havE appeared to night , and I havE
appeared only. to [des???] that from your
mind — but your Seer ought not to havE
inspected this Evening , for she has just
lost a friend who is now Standing between
her and You. And although a good
Spirit She is not Sufficiently high for me
to come in Contact with and I should
therefore be obliged by your discharging
me and I put her into that unconscious
State that She might not be aware of
it — for it would do her harm
Your Seer is now returning

8' past 8 PM
Invoked the Spirit of the Mirror to [?]
[?] to havE a Vision (See opposite )
After calling at least of an hour before the M Clouded
I asked to be informed Whether the Spirit to whom this
M was Originally duplicated was Still attached to it
And the M [?] but only the response appd.
11149
it is the same Spirit who [?] the M
It is Unchanged
It was [?] to the AA [MIch??l] is he still its protector
11150
He is
May I ask if he would favor us by Appearing
11157
I do not think he will be able
To whom Are we indebted for these Responses
30

11152
To one who is appointed to give them
from the Spirit of the Mirror

May I ask if we can see him this Evening

11153
he is not able to be here

Some time since I lent this M for some months to
two different friends & not having used it since I was
uncertain if the Spirit of the Mirror had deserted it

11154
You were wrong to lend the Mirror
and must not do it again

May I ask if you would favor us by appearing

11155
I do not know whether I am allowed
to do so or not.

I lent this M to my friends to induce them to practice
Mirror Calling instead of Spirit Rapping.

11156
It is much better that they should
do so.

but then my friends would deem it unkind if I refused
to lend them one of my Mirrors.
Can we see Mr. Anderson --

11157
Called Mr Anderson
I cannot appear I am engaged at a [fight?]

I should be [petrified?] by my Al. Spirit appearing
    I will enquire

11158
Called my At. Spirit [J.H.?]
"I do not like to deliver his message

pray do tho I know he is able to be made

11159
It is any thing but polite I can assure 
you.
He says don't you wish you may get it
He says he would appear but does not 
like, yet he is very anxious to see your 
Seer.

Could you favor us with a Vision

11160 
I should not be allowed
will you form me with the name you would wish
to be called or known by

11167 
When I here have to give of you most certainly.
May I ask what fight Mr. Anderson is engaged 
in that he cannot appear.

11162
It is not my in battle he told me it
was an affair of the heart, but not 
about Miss Green.
Can we see my AT Spirit Fred Hockley now 
not this Evening when I asked him 
he told me.

11163 
his books were not clear and he 
could not think of appearing before a 
Lady
Can I call [?] the [Mrs?] Angel

11164
I will enquire but I have already
[resolved?] the time allotted to me 
by the Spirit of this Mirror.

Invoked the C.A.

The CA is here

As you have kindly promised & assured me that I
shall be able to continue our communications by my
present Seer, I hope to make the best use of my
opportunities, but the writing up the responses [?]
[received?] from my late dear Seer has occupied me 
so [closely?] I am not prepared with any questions

11166 
There is a promise you made to your
late Seer which you have not fulfilled 
do this and with respect to your late
Seer all will go well.

I need not I [own some repeat?] that to do my
late dear Seer service with [?] I would give
Mr Lea all her drawings however much I
prize them but I really do not know & indeed 
cannot at all conceive which is the drawing 
my dear Emma means

11167
I must have this question answered 
as that certainly has great influence
upon her.
[?] Eve being Tuesday I will search thro 
Even paper I have to my Y discover it. 

11168 
You are wrong to night is Tuesday 
June I made a mistake but on Wednesday Evening 
I will throughly search for it. 

11169 
let it be so (the CA Sainted) 
Above all our commotions or responses to any 
questions, I prize your [MA &?] Spiritual works 
May I without offense ask as my Seers Sight
Seems not thoroughly Established ask when 
we can receive the 4th book 
11170 
I have not forgotten it neither do I
33

promise that which I do not intend
to fulfill
You shall receive that with many others
in due time.

I had my future Seer Ellen Agnes [Emory?]
staying with me on Sunday & yesterday but as 
she is so young I did not try her powers, but
must take another opportunity of taking your advice
about testing her

11171
I will inform you when that time
shall be.

last Tuesday Ev'g being wet I did not like to risk
exposing your M(irror) to the damp & therefore brought
my box mirror and altho I did not have any 
vision whatever several responses were given by
a Spirit who declined to give his name or appear
may I ask his name & office

11172
It was one of a lower order who are
always in attendance on those above
them, therefore he would not be
allowed to appear unless by consent
of the Spirit of the Mirror

I asked to see my At. Spirit but he declined 
appearing & sent one of his usual silly & offensive 
answers -- [Are?] there no means by which I could
entice him to appear & answer rationally

11173
After he has appeared once to your
Seer I think you will gain some 
important information from him

but he never talks rationally except when he wishes
to do mischief as when he brought the Spirit who
offered me the diamond.

11174
he would do that perhaps again
but that is no reason why you should
not master that feeling
34

I will take an opportunity under your advice
of endeavoring to make him give me rational &
[instructive?] responses

11175
Let it be so 
I should wish you should if you 
can assist your present Seer a 
little in drawing and I will do the 
rest.

My friend Mr Dresser wishes very much to 
obtain either the faculty of Seeing himself or by
means of a member of his family will you kindly
inform me if he will be able to do so

11176 
No answer

As Mr Lea has never inspected my [E?]
glass & it is now some years since I invoked 
that Spirit -- I am of course uncertain whether
[E?] still protects that glass or whether he has
forgotten us entirely

11177
We have not such shallow memories
I will on a future evening call him if I have 
your permission

11178
You have

Here my friend Lea entered the room & we began 
discussing the subject of the [drawing?] & I [mentd.?]
the only [c?] drawing I had was an unfinished
one of Som's -- and that I have forgotten what
dress E. wore -- when the CA said

11179
If you had asked that questions of 
your Seer you would have been
informed what dress [Ellesmo?] wore

upon Lea describing the drawing I found that 
unfortunately the mistake was mine & that the
drawing I had thought was a portrait of Ellesmo
[m?] was in reality the [regained?] one of Ellesmo
whereupon the CA said
35
11180
I am glad you havE Succeeded in
finding it
I expressed my great regret

11181
We will not discuss this Now.
If we could be favored with a Vision

11182
I would grant your request but it
would be better that it should not
be so
I regret to hear we cannot havE any Visions as they
interest us all so much
11183
Not more that I do in refusing it
but it is for your Seers good — you
will remember what I told you the
last EvEning I appeared.
Since then her late friend has lost
her sister , to you as mortals — they
are together. — the first wishing to
appear very much.

Invoked the CA
The CA is here.
Last Tuesday, I was prevented Calling You [?] a friend
being present but I brought to Mr. Lea the [?]
my late dear Seer made for him , I regret that
owing to her having left it unfinished. I mistook it
for the portrait of S.o.m. — I now place it before the
Mirror.

11184
I will have this information Conveyed
to her & will give you her answer the
36

11185
Next time I appear

My dear Seer having left it unfinished will you also
enquire if she would like me to finish it as the pear
shaped ornaments are left on it. of course I only wish to
do so to please her

11186
I will learn

As I am not certain whether we may see my dear
friend again in the Mirror I wish to observe that --
whilst speaking there appeared

11187
You will see her again with a radiant
countenance full of happiness and joy
and when she appears I trust the
information she will be able to give you
the directions she will be able to lay
down for you, will be by you most
strictly observed.

I thank you I will endeavor to do so as I know
they will truly be given by your sanction, I can only
regret my inability to follow the advice you
have so kindly & frequently given to me

11188
You are mortal and can only place
your faith in Him - a higher power
than mine.

I was going to observe & I wish to do so only that 
having sent it before you my mind will be relieved
but I have been much hurt at the responses I
have received from my late dear Seer since her
decease has been when referring to me so unkind
& considering her devoted attachment to me when
alive I have felt it acutely?-- at the same time
to my friend Mr & Mrs Lea as tho comparatively
strangers -- her responses have been the reverse.

11189
Of this I am not her Master.
What her reasons were I do not know
perhaps though unkind to you they
57

were for her own benefit

11190
   I mentioned to her on one occasion that
she appeared unkind to you.
but her [manner?] was -- no you were not
so candid to your friends as you ought to be
you ought to judge between mere acquaint's.
& friends.
   I ceased to make a further remark 
for she was in closer connection with
your Earth than I can ever be.

If from to me any unknown Spiritual [Land?] it
will be [conducive?] to her happiness I am content
and having mentioned it to you I will not grieve
any more about it

11191
It is my wish you should cease to 
think any more of it.
   She will appear if you wish it
in her new order the second Tuesday
in March.

I [?] much thanks

The CA [bowed?]

My present Seer suffers much from coldness of the
extremity -- numbness &c which with her is very
unnatural as from certain circumstances, I am afraid
it might be [produced?] thro' the Evil wishes of some
one known to us May I ask if you could give her
a Seal agt it or shall she apply to her GS.

11192
All will pass away I am sorry she 
has not about her the Seals she has 
already received from Mr Lea's G.S. 
but let her wear the, for a week &
if that does not pass away then I will
give her one she shall wear and her
health shall be restored to her. In a great
measure your illness has caused here
omitted " In others it is not so when they have 
passed from your world should they have been 
good & after what you mortals term death they 
find the objects of their choice on Earth. not 
so pure and good as they might be, they 
try to turn their mind to a future state of
happiness  "
36

When mortals on this Earth die are they able to linger
about their former homes or the houses of those persons
to whom they were attached in life for any period
after their decease

11193
If they were attached to one Mortal
more than to another they cling to that 
Mortal for a short --- time?

did you say for a short time

11194
I did -- with a hope that they might 
shortly follow & be with them -- see 

Are they in that state cognizant of what is going 
on in the dwellings they so visit

11195
They can. They can tell what is said
of them and whether they are regretted 
and in many instances they droop 
their heads and forget if they have 
existed.
But there are exceptions even to this
rule.

But I meant to say can they only hear those they
are as Mesmerists say "En rapport" with or any one
such as strangers who may be in the room.

11196 
It is only with those they are most
attached to.

On the 10th May 1859 you mentioned you were 
anxious to appoint a Spirit of a lower order to be 
with me & direct me in my worldly transactions
& acquaint you therewith & that on a future evening
you wished him to appear before I came to the
conclusion whether I would receive him or not, is 
that still your wish, allow me to observe I do not 
wish to have any but yourself.

11197 
At present I think he had better not
be called. I have been able to carry you
through that which I so much feared I 
should be unable to do.
(My seer passed [??] during this respose being [?]

39

The CA then said 

11198
"I have linked thee with thy present Seer and
"Now all will pass on well
"  (that remnant [?] provide)
"There will be a time when I will explain
"Every thing but not now."

I thank you I will then try & dispel the unpleasant
doubts & vexations I have suffered under lately with
regard to my present kind of communication and will
as I always have done leave my Spiritual affairs
to your entire guidance but I have lately been
exceedingly concerned in my mind relating to it.

11199
Will you not all [?] to know you 
better than you know yourself.
   I think when you convey every 
thing to your mind you will come to 
the conclusion that every thing has 
resulted for your good.

I thank you and I will take the earliest opportunity
of giving my Seer a few lessons in drawing agreeable 
to your instructions

11200
I will be the ruler of that.
I do not wish to leave, understand me
rightly, but I think I had better 
be discharged.

May we be favored with a Vision

11201
There are too many passing away
the sentence I leave unfinished you
must judge the rest.

10' past 8 PM M. Michaels Mirror

As I had not used this Mirror for a long time & have
also lost it for some months to Mr [Corsland?] & Mr Jones
of Peckham I was uncertain whether the [AAM?] still
cont'd attached to it or not and I therefore requested
& invoked the Spirit M. if still attached to it
to appear or permit us to have a Vision

   After calling strenuously for at least a 
quarter of an hour -- without the Mirror [Clouding?]-- it
became dark and there appeared

11202
I Michael the Spirit of this Mirror
will not be able to appear for a month
from this time - But you can have
a Vision I will send one who will amuse 
you

May I ask if you can appear only on a Tuesday
Evening.

11203
I shall be able to appear on any Evening

May I ask who it is that will favor us by appearing

11204
It is one who will be allowed to appear 

may I ask his name 

11205
It is Mr. Anderson who wishes to
appear

15' past 8. Now the Mirrors clouded again heres a [fea?]
come in an black dress coat, black trousers
light satin waistcoat with light colored tie with
white lace ends.

May I ask your name

11206
A suitor for the hand of Miss Ereen
41

Since I had the pleasure of communicating with you
I have lost my beloved Seer Emma and a sad loss
it has indeed been to me.

11207
I am aware of that, I saw her when 
she died, or I should have said 
when she slept to live.

My present Seer is Mrs. Charlotte Lea the wife of my
friend Mr. Henry Lea. - and upon and to her my late
dear Seers powers of Spirit Seeing have been transferred

11208
I have had the pleasure of Seeing
the Lady before

here he waved to her very politely

When I formerly called you - [We had?] at times to receive
from you when in a serious mood some of the most
interesting [relations?] I have ever obtained but generally
you were so provokingly frivolous -- that our evenings were
spoiled

11209
I am like a friend of mine I think I
shall not very easily change

Are you aware [&c?]

11210
I am glad you added that as I was 
going to make another rude remark

Are you in England now

11211
I am not

I have been assured by the CA that we shall
ultimately become acquainted, I mean in this
world.

 11212
You could now if you took a ship 
to Jersey

but then I should not recognize you unless 
I took this Lady with me

11213
Ah but then I would wear a particular
dress

do you remember the metaphysical book the
C/A gave me
42

11214
I have a knowledge of some of it

my present Seer hasnt the slightest idea of drawing
yet the CA has assured me she will be able to complete 
it.

11215
Yes but you will first have to assist her

Yes and the CA says he will do the rest

11216
Ah you are a happy dog, or if you are
not you ought to be.

Not so happy, living here alone, is not so jolly. I can
assure you. I am almost tired of it already

11217
You have been a Bachelor for this every
certainly - this evening in particular
I should say ----

Is [M? E?] then [m?] alive still

11218
Your Seer has to -----

do you continue to use your Crystal or Mirror

11219
Sometimes but I am more engaged
with the [pair?] --

there he put his hand upon his heart with a sly look
have you had any curious or magical mischiefs since
I last left you

11220
I have several curious things to tell you
but I am not allowed to do so

Why not pray

11221
I have not been informed yet why but
I am told to be very particular.

11222
They are of too curious a nature

Will you appear some other evg and inform us

11223
"I will what night
[what night ] will suit you best"

As I do not reside with my Seer I must consult
her convenience & must call & request you to appear
as opportunity may serve -- if you will consent 

11224
Under these circumstances I will
43
but I s[hould] think I should like to
Appear upon a Thursday Evening
I will with my Seers Consent Call you next Thursday
and then I hope you will be serious

11225
As the following year dawns in upon
us we shall all be obliged to be more
serious.
Is that the Effect of Some Occult law in the
Spiritual world

11226
It is
WE havE Scarcely Seen you Since the Crimean War ended
when my present Seer saw you [?] twice

11227
Your Seer does not look well in that
Jacket any more than she did in her
White one not but what it is a pretty
Jacket , but I dont like the Cold it
does not suit her.

11228
I do not allways like to tell the Ladies
what they look well in
Ms A's going away
will you ask my Atmospheric Spirit to come in
hes gone. & there is Come

11229
"Not to night"
[Mll?] Michael the Spirit if this Mirror kindly tell
me if we Can see anymore At: Spirits this EvEning

11230
do not despair ——— although You will
not see any more visions or havE any
more responses

11231
You will find as the year Comes in all
will go on well.

11232
Every thing that you do and will do
is wisely ordered and all together
44

if it is for your good.

11233
"A few months from this they will be free"

This remained on the M till we left off

11234
It is well for you not to do so.
They may do so to you
It is much better for you that you
should do so but I am going for my
directions

Are we then to leave off asking any more questions
this Evening

11235
Yes

6' to 9

4die 15th Dec. 1859            [Thelon?] Terrace

Old Michaels Mirror

15' past 8 PM

Called Mr. Anderson

The Mirror clouded but he did not appear

called again if [&c?]

11236
I cannot come for I am dressing

Shall I wait a quarter of an hour

11237
In 5 minutes

In exactly 5 minutes he entered in dressing gown & slippers
Good evening Mr. Anderson I called you this Evening
as on Tuesday last you said you would be serious
and tell me some of your magical experiences

11238
I said on a Thursday I did not
mean tonight however I am very
pleased by music & perhaps for a little
45

While Mr Lea will oblige"

What piece do you prefer.

11239
The piece he was playing as Lea [?]
the Mirror

Mr Lea then played an Air or two

Are you in Jersey now

11240
A part of me is

have you had any thing curious in the Magical
way since you related your last adventure to my
late dear Seer - my present Seer Mrs. Lea would be
pleased to hear you.

11241 
I want to know if she will allow me
to take her likeness

My Seer says she has no objection

11242
I will fetch my apparatus

Have you heard that in America some Spiritual 
Apparitions have been photographed

11243
I heard some such nonsense but I
dont believe it

Allow me to show you my Seers portrait which was
taken at the Crystal Palace.

11244
Theres a little difference between that 
picture and the original tonight -- not
that I think they have flattered her
at all.

Then we should be happy to see your production
Now he's gone, he has come back he has brought a box
with him he's popped them down & stands puffing
away. -- Now he has undone the straps & taken 
the lid of it -- Now he has taken out some bottles
there are 5.

11245
Is your glass a 4 inch Mr. Mum

here it is I should say about 6 x 4 I cannot say
precisely

11246
Oh I'll take the size I have got my rule
46

hes looking for it -- & said

11247

No I have not, Ah I am not up to my business
 never mind I'll take it with my handkerchief

Now he's taken out his white hat and is measuring the glass as
you hold it up

11248
As you are laughing I shall take it on paper

Now he's taken a basin & glass and put some yellow stuff
into the basin, now he has taken out of the pot a little
gally pot -- full of black stuff, he has dipped the glass
into the basin

Will Mrs. Mum keep her eyes proper

Shall she take the [preservers?] off

11250
I think she had better

Now hes got another little box and put the glass in, he's
gone out now he has brought in a very handsome table
hes gone out again & brought in a beautiful chair very
old fashioned caned back with spiral pillar on each
side the back and covered with scarlet velvet

11257
Mrs. Mum can make the choice 

he has got in his hand a splendid cactus & some beautfl.
jellies of all kinds

11252
Which of the two

The lady prefers the cactus

11253
let it be so

hes gone away with the other now he's come back he has
taken the cactus and some very pretty lace paper he is
folding and trimming it about & made a little stand
 for the cactus & put it upon the table

11254
Now I will show you how I should like 
you to sit

Now he's placed himself in an attitude & pulled his vest
down tight & thrown his hand back & placed his arm
out towards the flower.

Mr. Lea did as requested

11255
That will do   dont move
47

in one minute he said

11256
That will do

he's got it, he's brought it out

11257
wait a minute I took two at the same time

Mrs Lea said I have got only one earring it looks so odd ( Mrs L
had only one in her ears at the time having broken the other 
that morning) Now hes shown the other & I am upside
down.

11258
You may take your [A?] but I shall 
keep this one (the [correct?] one)
I shall keep it up in my room and then
Miss Green will see it.

I said, It would be delightful for us if we could photograph
the splendid visions given by the CA and as the light 
emitted from them are so powerful that my Seers are 
obliged to wear smoked glasses I think it might
be done.

11259
do you think if I was as good as your 
GS the CA I could do this

Now what will you do with it

11260
this only makes the 149th lady's portrait 
I have taken

I wish you would give it to me

11261
Well here it is (holding it up to me) why 
dont you take it

It would be a great [boon?] to us if we could take [force?]
of the [surgeons?] visions that have been given to us

11262
If you could only see one you would 
never want to go to work again

Whilst Lea & I were talking as to our [powers to receive?] such
visions -- [M?]

11263
There are laws that are not laid down
for man to carry out

have you the secret of taking objects in their natural form

11264
No I have not, I suppose I had
48

11265
I should soon see you traveling about
in a caravan.
Tho we are much Amused & gratified at your performce.
I had hoped You had Ceased your quizzical ways
& turned Serious

11266
I should not exist without it, it is my first
and Second nature both. I am sure I
have been very polite—I havE left a lady
to come her.
You are the [?] of politeness — Especially to the Lady.

11267
You would say so if you could see her
pray ask the Lady to Come in

11268
I would only you would be so Enraptured
Mr. lea & Mr Anderson [?] the dialogue betwEEn
them for a short time.
Have you made any Magical experiments lately.

11269
No I havE not
Altho, I am aware you are unwilling for meet know your
real name & address — And havE been Assured I shall
ultimately know you in the body = Yet I have a great
wish that you would send one Newspaper. -or any other
valueless Article to y address = as a proof that
our Names & addresses Are Really transferred to the Spirit
world. by means of our [M] & Crystals.

11270
I could but I should to be allowEd
for if you cannot havE faith You cannot
havE proof.
that's mere Subterfuge. after so many years Close attentn.
to this Subject my faith must be known to be firm
& unshakable—it is for the Curiosity of the [th??y] itself

11271
such a thing could be done and I could
do it , and EvEn send you a message by
the electric telegraph, but I am not
allowEd I could do more I could by the
49

power of one appear in this room to you
By the aid of ----- Evil only

11272
It would be so and was that to be done
there would be always an appearance
about the house.
I do not doubt your faith, I nevEr have
shown a doubt upon it

11273
I am aware of all that
will Mrs [Mum?] ask her longet half to
show me the other Room. what I see looks
very nobby. I should like to see the doors
thrown open.
I opened the doors—will that do?

11274
I must be shown round, when a Gentleman
visits me I always do the honors personally

11275
No only I think Mr Lea might walk
Round and show me the valuable Articles
inside
Mr. Lea replied I will when you wish

11276
Well I am Ready , take to the right first
Mr Lea too the lamp & proceeded Round the Room naming
& describing some of the Articles particularly Ellismo's
Mirror & [Case?] and then returned - [[?]]
I hope you are satisfied

11277
You havE not shown me the curtains and
the [?] & the Looking Glasses all which
I think very handsome.
how do you like the picture ovEr the Piano "the origin of music"

11278
Ill go and look at it
hes gone out at one immense Stride
Now he's back again.

11279
I only wish I had seen it before I would
have taken a likeness of it
50

As you inspected that alone why did you not examine
the rest for yourself

11280
Generally when I have visions I take them
[round?] myself.
I must conclude by saying it is a regular
fairies room.

Mr Leas remarked that the taste & lightness displayed were 
due to Mrs Lea

11281
I am very pleased to hear you make this 
remark as Mrs Lea is rather heavy herself

Will you appear to Mr Lea when he calls

11282
Mr Lea does not wish that

When shall we see you again

11283
Not knowing I cannot say. I shall be
here again soon.

hes left

Mrs. Charlotte Lea Spex
CAM
Invoked the CA

7' to 8PM
Recd from the CA a further assurance as to
my spiritual studies with my present Seer.
(the formula -- when her left hand rises you may [commence?]
your questions when it falls she will return)

May we be favored with a Vision

11285
In 10 minutes from this time
51

die 10 Jan /60       The Vision

11286
The veil's fallen it is different from the 
others, its still lace like but there are smaller flowers
mixed with the others The veil is opening in the 
middle and falling back

I can only see 2 large rocks, they 
are very beautiful one is covered all over with herbage
green & beautifully minute indeed so singularly 
small. the rocks appear to have shifted away
slightly I can see a man with a long gown on 
and sandals the dress is white [bound] edged with 
pink, but quite plain, [It is drawn?] round the 
[middle] waist but I cannot see the fastening
because the dress hangs full over it. hes very 
old and has a long beard., he has a rod 
in his hand like a hazel rod. one rock 
is quite bare his wand is turning to the 
rock that has nothing on it, he's laid it
down at his feet now he has lifted up his
hands as if in prayer & turned his head
back, -- Now theres some strange printed 
letters come. -- & now in English letters

A. J. H.

& the others in their places have vanished 
at the back of all the herbage there are little 
angels coming up, some are as small as the
first joint of my finger & yet are so perfect
& distinct, so many oh so many they have
all feathered wings -- 

The little ones are at the bottom all in white
There are seven rows of angels every other row 
have dresses pink tinged with blue & the top
row's all white their hair's like gold & only
2 or 3 are black
x in the same way you [?] material [forms?] into the Spiritual
[?] obtained the [?] of the [parties/purities]

52

they are putting their hands out towards the 
old man he is picking up his wand in the 
front of the angels there's [Ame?].

"Give us to drink of the water of life."

he has struck the barren rock & there's a little
stream of water coming out. -- its all going 
away the old man's turned away & thrown 
his hand towards the rock they have all 
disappeared -- its all gone.

20' to 9 PM

As our vision has been so short may I call Mr. A
in the box M

11287
You may but I do not know if he
will appear.

Michaels Mirror

1/4 to 9

Called Mr. Anderson

Mr. Anderson is here

Good eve Mr. A & a happy New Year to you

11288
The same to you

We have been laughing at your taking my Seers
portrait with only one Earring on

11289
I should like to have taken it last 
night when she was eating pudding
with her fingers

Ah but we were busy playing cribbage together.

11290
She might have asked her friends 

Why are we unable to photograph Sp'l. Visions into the Material World x

11291 
because it is [wisely?] indeed that you should
not

Are you forbidden taking mere phot'g [sketches?] [?]

11292
I generally prefer getting their consent
53
that my Seer calls Evading the Question

11293
I am aware of the lady's Kind remark
Suppose we were to Invoke a Vision into the
Reflecting glass of a Photog'. Apparatus

11294
I won't be rude or I wd. say "dont you
wish you might get it.
My Seer's Got her earing mended you see.

11295
Ah as you havE drawn my attention I
Must say She looks better with two than
one. but She has not got rid of that
horrid Jacket.
I havE often wished to put your life of Your Vision relative
to lady Ada LovElace.— havE you any other. Relation
to oblige us with.

11296
I havE one to givE you the next time I come
that is Equally way more Curious
than that. but you can publish that
if you wish. You havE my full permission
to do so.
Mr. A's leaving
I requested him to say.— Now he's Returned running in
So fast.

11297
I thought I should like to see how
Mrs. Lea. would look in a Coronet
and I havE brought a lot of Tails
I havE brought form China
Now I can see myself in the Mirror such a little
[imp?]. and Mr A's gone behind me & put the
Tails on my head & now he's come in front &
is bobbing about to see how I look they are
at all colors on his Arm. they Are hair of
different colors with ribbons in them he is
arranging them in different styles & is looking
about to see how I look

11298
There I think thats very becoming
dont you
54

11299
Yes if she can take it I will show it
You presently perhaps the lady will
say if she thinks I have improved
her beauty.

11300
I am waiting very patiently for your answer

11301
Then she is not like women in general
for myself I think it a great improvemt.
and if I was her I would wear one 
like it -- I am sitting in an Easy Chair

hes gone, hes running in again & got such a many
different things -- a pair of scarlet slippers lined
up at the toes. -- a ladys work box very handsome
carved & inside like satin wood, all let in, hes put
the lid down its carved ivory covered with red
silks

11302
Well all I know if you wont have it
(holding it out to Mrs. Lea) its your own
fault take it if you like and this 
was given to me by a wee young lady
Yur-o-yong

What does that name signify

11304
You are getting inquisitive --

Now hes got a little cradle lined with lace and a
little child about a quarter of an inch long laying 
in it very handsome

I suppose that's a present for Mrs. [Powell?]

11305
No its not and I have not shown
it to any person only your Seer.
will you have it

hes holding it out to me in front of the M and
I am no longer in the Mirror
how did you just now bring the likeness of
my Seer into the Mirror
55

Mr A said
"that is an art you have to find out yet"

Now he is picking all the Tails up & placed
them round his neck & said

11306
Its rather cold they'd do instead of
furs. --

hes going
I will take an early opportunity of calling you, if you
will be kind enough to appear & favor us with your
relation

11307
I will do so.

5' past 9 -

24th Jan 1860     [Willon?] Terrace
                               CA M

Invoked the CA

1/4 past 8
The CA is here
I have this evening the pleasure of calling you. my friend
Mr Lea has kindly consented that I shall have every other
Tuesday for my communications with you

11308
I am glad you have come to a satisfactory 
conclusion with respect (to our communicating
with each other.)

As our sittings occupy with my present Seer only about
an hour & a half. -- a Seance every other Tuesday will give
me about 40 hours -- it is therefore of serious moment to
me that I make the best use of my invited opportunity
and I should prefer receiving the conclusion of your 
Metaphysical work is she one you last performed instead
of seeking [?] powers to my questions

11309
All that you wish shall be given to you
in due time.

That may I observe that to you whose knowledge of "Time"
56

is so exceedingly [?]. What may appear "due time" to you
may consume to me an age -- The 40 hours which
I may expect to set apart for communicating with you will
last a year it is therefore imperatively necessary that I
make the best use of them.

11310
To me that would appear a Speck.

possibly so, but to me supposing I were to live 20 years
longer. -- those 40 hours would occupy a time equal to
1/20th of my existence -- & consequently render me
most [desirous of receiving one of your esteemed works [with?]
only as the most conducive to my Spiritual Knowledge
but as affording me matter for deep consideration at
other hours.

11311
I will give you sufficient notice when I
will give you the remainder of that work

My friend Mr Mackenzie -- as I have before informed you
not seeing the promised gift of Seership so soon as
he was led to expect hes with his usual fractiousness
been alternately hoping & doubting & for some time has
received thro his mother as a writing medium & [?]
by impressions thro his own hand some communications 
from a Spirit of a decd. person calling himself Samuel
Jennings, who has promised a Seership of remarkable
& unusual powers -- Mr M has therefore requested me 
to obtain from [Seven O man?] -- answers to these questions
which I am very desirous of doing, as having introduced
Mr M. to S.O.M. & this became the means of their Spiritual
Connexion I should like to give S.O.M the opportunity of  
giving MM. his advice or reference to his Spiritual Studies
indeed I feel it a duty I owe them both. -- & after that
has been done I should no longer (from what has
passed between you & myself) have any further interest in
the matter -- I must own that from what I have 
read of S Jennings communications they appear sensible
& trustworthy
57

(Whilst I am thus expressing myself my Seer remarked
that the CA looked sad & several times shook his head
slowly=)

11312
I hope he will never be rash enough
to attempt this for we know that all
Evil is attended with good at the
beginning, for they are obliged to cloak
their wickedness for a time. until they
shall have that mortal sufficiently 
within their power.

I also wish to say I should like SOM to appear in
this Vision with your permission -- as I have even
myself been afraid [that] it being impossible for my
present Seer to know that you are the same as appeared
to my late dear Seer -- lest any other Spirit should
[?] himself upon us

11313
No Spirit of an inferior order would dare
to take my place -- So rest content

When shall I then call SOM

11314
I will enquire but if he has taken up
with a visiting medium I should think 
SOM had ceased to be his Guardian
Spirit.

I will with you permission read his questions

11315
do so

I read them.

11316
I see no objection to the questions but as I
am your guardian Spirit I do not wish to
give any opinion upon them.

When then shall I call SOM.

11317
I will ascertain & let you know

When will you let me know

11318
on the next Tuesday that I appear

I also wish to observe -- that my friend Mr [D?], whom
I very greatly esteem -- has in consequence of his masonic
58

masonic lodge being erased not joined any other
Lodge. Thus frantically giving up any active connects.
with the body

11319
I am glad to hear that.

As to Mr [Dr?] on a future occasion being present
& my desire to obtain [herein?] the opportunity of practicing
the Crystal

No answer

Have you any objection

11320
I have not any objection

As to my late dear Seer

11321
She will progress now.

The [Rev T. L Harris?] from America has lately deld.
on Sunday's Morning & Evening -- [discourses?] on Spiritualism
I have heard him with very great pleasure -- but last
Sunday week when I was unfortunately not present 
he delivered a very severe denunciation of Spirit Rapping
& writing mediumship

11322
He is quite right, they are of the
lowest order -- but he has a Spirit now 
whose rank is as [of] my own [order]. who is
always with him & thus though
having so good a GS you get the 
truth from one that bears the Mortal 
form.

I understand he speaks from Spiritual impulse

11323
he does do so

Whilst I was pausing to consider my next question
there came

11324 
Have you heard from your Father

Yes last week, from a friend who informed me [conceding?]
his age 82, he was exceedingly well &c &c

11325
It does not seem to me as today, but
very near, and he will pass away.

I was in hopes for certain reasons he might be [proved?]
59

for a few years longer but in case of his death nothing 
on Earth shall induce me to have any concern about
his wife or family

11326
It is my wish that you should not.

After what has passed this evening I do not wish to press
the subject on the subject of our Sucess of Comms.

11327
You must go on with a few questions for a
time

As to the Monk & his MS.

11328
That had better be left for a time

If my &c.

11329
I should wish you to act towards him as
you have forthwith done & be at the office as
mush as you can.

If have a Vision

11330
Yes you can have one
at 5 past 9.

11331
I hope to make your evenings more pleasant 
than they have been for years.

The CA left 5' to 9 PM.

5' past 9     The Vision

11332

Here is a [puce?] colored curtain (not a veil)
let down gradually from the top flowered all 
over as tho' embossed -- Now it is going up again
but vey gradually -- the Mirror is so black 
all over -- I cannot see through it-- Now it looks
as if one was on the Earth the mould all round  
it is lowering down -- now its a good way down from 
the top of the mirror -- theres a great number of
things -- in the mould they are horrible things I
60

Cannot tell what they are I dont like to look at
them theres some are crocodile looking things 
with thick tails & great heads -- & shiny looking things
& many forms with fishes heads. -- it keeps on going 
gradually down. -- they look as tho they [?] in
cells --

Now theres light coming at the top theres 
the pass and the trees and theres roots running
under ground there appears like little openings 
in the roots like little mouths as tho they were 
seeing nourishment from the Earth.--
Now its down quite to the bottom of the mirror -- its
all over grass & [trees?] & above the sky & the sun
shining so bright -- 

The trees are so beautiful & sunny
some with very long leaves bending down some
very fine leaves some like oaks and others 
like weeping willows only so beautifully lit up 
as it were by the sun shining upon them -- theres 
a great number [?] I should think 
all in their natural colors and the sun
shining down on them -- in the center theres a 
large tree such long leaves and on its written

PALM

Now its changing it turning like gold
now its all gold -- theres a number of figures
moving in & out among the trees with books in 
their hands as though studying they are
dressed in white gowns but have no wings
Now here is a Spirit come in front of the gold
tree -- why its the CA he has placed the
right hand out he is leaning against the
tree -- theres reading coming -- No its a ray of
light -- The CA appears to look all round
Now there's a figure advancing towards the CA     
61

it is veiled all over I can only see its a human
form -- it has gone on its knees before the CA
the figure is kneeling with its head bowed down
and given the CA a book -- on the ray theres 
come "more require it" and the CA has given it
to one passing at the back -- the sun is shining
so splendid on the CA now theres reading time
in the light"

1133
"I thank thee O Father that I have
been able to raise one more above the 
things of the Earth." -------------

This writing became so small at the end that
my Seer could not read the remainder

The figures are still the same and the 
CA has put his hand upon the head of the
kneeling figure & said

Arise and soar with me upwards 
Oh the trees are all going down and the CA
keeps his hand on the figures head - They
are going up the rest is all going downwards
-- I can see a door at the back, it looks like
a satin wood door.-- The CA has turned both
have turned their faces to the door and a
ray of light has gone from the CA & on it is

Knock

The veiled figure has moved the hand & arm under
the veil and knocked. -- The door's opened
and theres a beautiful hall with figures in
it -- the CA has put the veiled figure in
and the door's closed The CA is rising
out at the top -- The Mirror is clear

1/2 past 9   Action Ended

[?]7 Feb. 1860             Clouderley Terrace
23' to 8PM.       CAM

Invoked the CA
The CA is here in white purple robe wings brown &c as usual
Mr. Mackenzie having requested SOM's responses & advice
to these queries & also [to req] to impregnate the Seal which he 
has more correctly copied -- I am desirous to know if SOM 
will kindly appear this evening

11334
Seven O Mana has ceased to be his 
Guardian Spirit

I regret to hear that may I ask when SOM ceased being
his GS.

11335
When he took up with the writing himself

As I do not wish to call SOM again will he be kind 
enough to appear and give Mr. M such advice as he
may deem best under his present circumstances

11336
I do not think he could give him any
now.

Whilst I was thinking what reply to make, my Seer said
theres reading coming now -

11337
But when on the last evening I appeared 
& said I would inform you when S.O.M.
would appear I omitted to mention that
I knew all spirits who were not connected 
with living mortals would be busy with
their occupations for a month to come

I am sorry that I have not been enabled to give Mr.
M. the responses sought as for many reasons I do
not wish to ask any more questions on his account
but SOM promised him that he would have the 
sight and he has been informed by S.J that he will
have a very extraordinary Seership

11338
He would have been a Seer long ere this
if he had persevered in the sight way

I am sorry his connection with writing spirits has
63

[Proved?] so unfortunate to him & deprived him of SOM's
care which I believe he prized much

11339
were you to come in contact with Spirits 
such as those -- I too should cease to be
your guardian spirit
   However much [you wish] my wishes
for your good might guide you in the
right way for a time -- You would be sure
to fall in the Ways of Evil

I must say in extenuation of M M. that the response given by
SJ. appeared very unexceptionable to me. not that I
have had any wish to seek advice or instruction from
any Spirit but yourself.

11340
I have no wish that you should not hear
whatever any Spirit may have to say on
Spiritual matters. but when you have 
one who can give you so much [truth?] I
do not hesitate to say you would be wrong
to believe them.

But I have no desire now my means & time of communicating
has become so limited to seek or call any Spirit but
you. I merely now ask Mr Anderson to come as a 
source of interest to my Seer.

11341
I do not wish you not to call Mr Anderson
or any other Spirit you may desire but
at the same time I do not wish you
to rely on one that is Evil.

May I observe that I cannot but regret that SOM
has not deemed it fit to appear to give M M. any
advice

11342
I think if you look over your back books
you will find that on a former occasion
I told you that if a Spirit took upon
himself to become the GS of a mortal
& was not called upon faithfully he

64

"Ceased to be that mortals Guardian Spirit -- if I
11343
have not - that is the truth -
As to my acquaintance with Mr M. ceasing
11344
I should say being charitably disposed
to all persons that if you could succeed
in getting Mr M to forsake those evil
Spirits -- I must leave you as a mortal
to be a judge as to your giving up his 
acquaintance
On several occasions I have been to hear Mr T L Harris
deliver his sermons or discourses upon Spiritualism
& last Sunday my Seer also was with me. I am very 
greatly attracted by the doctrines he preaches & hope 
to hear all the rest he may give as unfortunately 
his stay is to be but a short one in England
11345
All that you hear from him are truths
and he at present is the only one
who preaches that. -------------------
all mortals [meet?] --------------------
But there was one part of his discourse 
where he heard wrong -- he said-- "That 
there was no hope beyond the grave"
He ought to have headed -- "there is all
hope beyond the grave"
11346
There are a few things that he hears
imperfectly, and he recapitulates them
wrongfully -- but it is not a wish 
on his part to say one word that is 
different from what he hears.
11347
He was a good Young Man & sought
after the ways of truth & knowledge
[one?] so he has gone from your world
before him knowing his thirst
65

for that knowledge was the means of 
his becoming an inspired man

May I observe that during the evening service my
Seer remarked that she saw a bright light at the 
right side of Mr Harris so strong that it became painful 
to her eyes. May I ask if his discourses come in
writing as our responses or if he sees Spirits

11348
He does see a Spirit with his naked eye
and had your Seer not turned her head
on Sunday night she would have beheld
one that is constantly with him

It was only with great exertion on my
part who attended you there & of [Ellesmo?]
who attended your Seer there. that she 
did not make a loud exclamation in
the place.

Mr. Harris informed us that the whole of his discourses
will be printed, I hope then to have the pleasure of
laying them before you for your remarks.

11349
I shall be happy to give you my informt.
I can, as to put the right words on the 
right places.

I thank you as my time for communicating with you is so
limited, I shall endeavor to make the best use of
it, & do not intend to be so communicative as I have been

11350
And after all your trouble find that 
it ends in annoyance.

I regret to say my friend Lea's health appears
very precarious

11351
I am aware of it, but we will pass 
this -- do not think me abrupt --

Then with your permission I will on a future
Evening place Harris' sermons [dues?], the new [?]
of S Matthew by Lawrence Shadwell before you

11352
let it be so

66

11353

I received before appearing to you this
Evening a message from Mr Leas G.S.
Ellesmo. he wished me to say that he
had informed Mr Lea that he wished 
him to arrange his private affairs
shortly -- and that a great deal remained 
with you -- will you be kind enough to
look to that --
   Will you be kind enough to say
that I am understood.

I beg to say I perfectly understand Ellesmo's wish &
will this Evening do what he wishes

11354
I thank you in his name

May I request on another evening you will kindly
impregnate my seals again I much wish it

11355
That wish is a fresh impregnation 

My head has unfortunately been very heavy again
on the right side & I was afraid my Seal had lost its 
power.

11356
The hat was removed & other hands
passed over it

About certain perplexities

11357
I will do all I can to help you
I will use my influence with you
I wish you to remain so, I do not see
that there will arise any dispute between
you.

As to my communicating with my late eloved Seer
on the 2nd Tuesday in March.

11358
All will be well
You may mention or ask or say that 
which you think best.
Her answers will be satisfactory.

I am sorry to say that I have [not?] prepared any
questions yet for really when I get home in
67

the evening there is such a heaviness on the right side
of my brain that I am quite unable to think

[?]die Feb. 12 1860
11 AM          Marylebone Institute
                     Edwards St [P?]
Mr Mrs. Lea & self went to hear Mr Harris's lecture
on the Millennium -- Mrs Lea used her preservers = &
she remarked that when Mr Harris commenced
his second prayer her eyes became painful &
aching then there came a gauze like appearance
between two very small & young looking spirits who
were stretched out horizontally as tho flying -- they
were very small abut 30 inches long & had on 
golden [house?] dresses with little wings apparently
on their heels. their wings were beautiful & feathery 
& stood right up & on the gauze were the words
of his prayer. --

When Mr Harris turned towards the clock 
(to his right) there was an angel exactly like
the CA in white dress & purple robe wings &c
only of greater size -- twice the size of Mr Harris
and when Mr Harris held his hands up the Spirit
appeared to have the tips of his fingers on the 
top of Mr H's right hand and as he shook
In the middle of the [Pucorme?] there appeared a large [Cen?] as 
tho made of [sepuity?] & open work which seemed to press down upon 
the audience & upon the upper point there were a great many
spirits upon it - all with image like good spirits
68

his hand there appeared a ray of light to go
into Mr Harris's Ears from the Spirits mouth
a golden colored light -- and when Mr Harris's
sermon concluded the Spirit dipped his hand
before Mr Harris's face & Mr Harris said Amen. x

630 PM      Evening Service

When Mr Harris entered at the side door on to the
dais the Spirit entered with him and during the prayer
& lesson took his [motion?] at the back of the chair under
the [pewter?] lamp & when Mr H commenced the Sermon
he shifted [his] to Mr Harris' side -- the Spirit was
[?] & when Mr H spoke of the Evil Spirits taking 
possession of us -- a great many Evil Spirits in human
form and dress stood looking at Mr H -- They
appeared Evil & deceitful in then countenances there
were about 20 of them. When Mr Harris finished
his discourse the covered Spirit left & Mr Harris began
alluding to some letters he had recd. -- My Seer
being bery faint we left. --

21 Feb. 1860              Thelon Terrace
C.A.M.

6' to 8 PM   Invoked the CA

On the 12th Feb. my Seer Mrs. Lea accompanied me
to the morning & evening service performed by Mr
Harris at the [Many?] Institution -- & she saw
the Spirits (as related above which I read) who were
[?] him -- May I ask if you were there
& if she saw the Spirits truly as described

11367
I was --
She is quite correct and I regret her [being?]
ill -- for she would then have been able 
69

to have read the prayer at the close of that
sermon, which Mr Harris used

I am also very sorry her becoming so faint compeled us
to leave

11362
You must not dine so late

Our dinner on that day was unfortunately 2 hours later
than usual & the dinner itself rather [rich?] & indigestible

11363
It was not that but you & her ought
not to walk or take any exercise directly
after dinner

I have also been lately again much troubled with
mind spasms

11364
The time will soon come when that 
will pass away

& may I ask if the open tapestry work of the carpet
which appeared above the congregation was as described

11365
It was so and that was a [rep?]
of the curtain that shall pass over 
the invoked and crush them down to
the bottomless pit when the Millenium
shall be half fulfilled

I repeated the word half fulfilled to my Seer to ascertain
if it was correct When the CA said

11366
It has commenced

Mr Harris 's denunciations of Spirit Rapping [Take?]
my &c was exceedingly severe tho perfectly in
accordance with your teachings I rejoice now
at having had so little to do with it 

11367
I should be very sorry for you to have 
even a wish to do so and was I to allow 
it as your guardian Spirit I should cease
to be a Servant & a faithful follower
of my Father.

Mr Harris on Sunday suffered so severely from
[Neuralgia?] in the head, that he was doubtful

70
Whether he wd. be able to perform the [>] Service & Mr.
& Garth Wilkinsin told Mr Homlt that he suffered so much that perhaps no one had Ever delivEred a
[?] under such circumstances before
11368
It was the evil Spirits that were fighting
with him to turn him from the ways
of [?].
He did not howEver in any way betray that the was
suffering — & at the Conclusion fo the EvEning service remarked
in relation to it that during his discourse he had
Appeared as the immortal & lifted up abvE his [?]
body.
11369
He is Stronger in his faith & is thereby
lifted abovE any Evil that he may
come in contact with
Mr H also very [?] depicted the Conditions of those
departed Spirits — who clinging to the Earth Still [?]
near & attend upon [?] mortals who are actuated
by the same Affections & passions — as they had in the
world — and assist & Encourage them in the same [?]
11370
There all always plenty of those Wandering
Spirits to Seek others who would follo
win their footsteps
Mr. Harris in his [?] ([?] Modern Spiritualism) quoted
the remark made by Heinrich [E?ing]-Stilling "Another
the devout stilling writing after the first meserie develop"?
began stated taht internals had from da Stupendous
plot against the peace & order of the World which was
to be accomplished by means of sorceries that would follow
in the Mesmeric Pathway."
11341
It is so and if a mortal was Evil
disposed and wished to make his fellow
Than so — If he used a strong will and
the others will was not so strong he could 
lead him to commit any Error in Evil
71

what he wished him to do

There has obviously Even to me a great change taken
place in our communicating with the Spirit World as
[even?] 6 or 7 and 20 years ago when Spirit [comm?]
[crystalwork?] I had much more difficulty in getting
Visions and Spirit Seers than at the present time

11372
The time had not arrived then when 
Spirits should appear [?] to man 
and lay down for his use those truths
which was and his given by our Father
to bring him sooner to His home. when
he should have passed from this world
than he otherwise [should] would

I then read the paragraph page 57 of the sermon on
Modern Spiritualism its --

"Man lives alternately a two fold existance, he is consciously
on Earth with Mortals during hours of physical wakefulness
and activity; during this time the Spirit is immersed in
the body, and watched over, as was said before, when longer 
sleep becomes perfect the Spirit is so far disengaged from
matter as to [p?] a round of activities in a state of lower
waking, It is then consciously with Spirits -- we carry this 
sleep into [inner?] waking the ruling passions that we have
chosen to dominate over us. -- Now the whole subject of
[Mediumship?] stands in a new light, on entering through 
sleep into the world of Spirits we rush into the arms of
those to who we are attracted by moral affinity we are 
with them as associates"

11373
I think you have already that 
communication from me in one of your 
works.

I do not at the moment remember it -- I have rarely
had prophetic dreams -- & tho like most others, I
dream just before waking -- yet however absurd or confused
the dream may have been I can generally have its 

72
features to some Circumstance of the previous day or objects
that have attracted me.

[*fig.*?] 
11374
When those dreams as you term them
Occur it is to cause a forgetfulness of
what the spirit has seen and heard
during its travels
proof-

Your present Seer had as She termed it a
dream of one who had passed away
— Yet that one cherished a dear memory
to the other — and when your seer was
asleep , her Spirit left her body. and went
to the other's hone  that was for that time,
the other had a wish once more to behold
her— and they held Communication with
Each other.—
had that other one been Evil, the
Spirit of your Seer would not have returned
Have I made myself understood

I thank you, You have. And it Appears a fearful power
for one that is dead to have over the living

11[7]375
You cannot tell what Sacrifice they
make.

I have often wondered at persons so soon forgetting
the dead— those whom they have Sincerely lived. &
watched over with the utmost Care when Sick =  Yet when
dead seem so soon forgotten.— I now see it is indeed
a true providence that it is so

11376
You are right it is
but when they do not return they are so
infatuated with what they see , that they
do not wish it for a time , but find it out
to their cost when too late.
73

Your relation surprises me Yet I think nothing could
be more desirable than the power of remembering so as to 
embody it in writing -- our experiences in these singular
excursions of the Spirt -- indeed Ellesmo gave me
the formula but I never tried it.

11377
It would only unsettle you for your 
Every day occupation.

I thank you I am aware it would do so, & I
always at night pray that I may be preserved from
the Power of Evil Spirits"

11378
It is enough for you to pray to him
who watches over all to keep you in that
position which was [allothed?] for you
   If you do this fervently you will find
it sufficient

I must I do so fervently every night -- & also request
your kind influence -- for I find myself since the
loss of my late beloved Seer -- Now I live alone. often
very dull. & my studies do not tend to enliven me

11379
He does not wish you to be dull for he
made all things for mans use and
sent them for his comfort & his pleasure
if used with discretion

I replied 

11380
Perhaps you wish me to understand
that at that time you feel as if you 
would like to be more good.

That is what I feel & I hope soon to take up the 
[[NT.] & enter seriously upon the subject

11381
Rest assured that you would make great
progress then.

With your assistance I hope to do so

11382
I must again remind you as I did 
on my last appearance that I should
not be able to stay for a lengthened period.

 
74
When on a Tuesday [?] evEning I use my M alone. & call +c.
do you then hear & understand what I ask.
11384
I do hear you but I do not havE that
power with you so much as when I appear
but when I use this formula it is to Explain wishes which
I od not wish to do Even by the [?] formula with my Seer
11385
I know all your wants before they are
Asked
I again explained any use of them. & my wishes at length.
11386
I will by and make myself understood
When you call upon me , I do not hear
you call, I am informed by Spirits
nearer to he Earth. taht you wish my
presence I then come near yo and
by doing so am enabled to see into your
mirror man & know your wants.
11387
HavE I made myself understood so far
but when called by the Mirror, my influence
is greater with you , therefore able to
keep a greater influence ovEr you from
time to time than I otherwise should be
able to do. if a Communication did
not take place between us.
11388
I havE conversed with you & my influence
is of greater WEight
11389
I havE only one object in View . that is
to brig you to the Shores of happiness
and to final rest.

10' 10 9 PM

11390
the dream as related by my seer. 
I thought I was ill in bed at my present house and 
Mr. Lees called as usual to see me - that M Lea was 
sitting by the fire in my bedroom and the following
dialogue took place
Mr Lees    O there you are again. 
Mr Lea     Will you share some supper 
Mr Lees    No I'll not
Mr  Lea     will you sit down 
Mr  Lees    No - & took up the Candle and went downstairs
Mr  Lea      Are you going
Mr  Lees    I'm off
Mr  Lee?    Old man (to Mr Lea) go & let "S[?]" out 
Mr  Lea      I shan't
Mr  Lea      You might as well she would do that
                    for
I then got out of bed and followed her down stairs
& Mr. Lees went into the ? = and at that moment I
said to myself " Thats not like a dead  woman" and
I had a thought about her being dead before - Then
I thought that Mr. Lea recollected Mrs Lees as the
was dead and sent his sister Ms Frome and the
maid to tell her to be careful of Ms. Lees as she
was dead, and I called out loud "[Sal?] have you
got a candle." and Mr Lees came out [I said]
and as Ms Frome came down stairs she shook
her fist at me to warn me = and I said (altho)
I felt I did not want Mrs Lees to feel I was afraid
of her because she was dead). "[?] [?]
I don't mind her = and Mrs. Lees then [loomed?]
& said "I have come for you my fascinating
charmer"
and I replied "No no  [Sal?] dont do that
for the sake of the Old Man that couldn't be 
right" - and Mr. Lees then said --
76

"well never mind, sleep on" and I thought I 
went to kiss & shake hands with her, but she 
went out at the street door walking backwards 
and I said "poor old sad mother" to her and 
she went down the steps to the gate and I bid 
her goodbye- and I saw a figure of a woman 
[trapped?] up over head and all at the gate- &
& I thought, "law what is that figure that must be 
Mr. Gibson and I went in and shut the door. 
& then woke up-
then smdo appeared in a minute -- on a [darkish colored wind.?]

 Mackenzie & [shorter?] = in the every [M?] = & indeed not so

Odie 26 Feb 1857          Wilton Terrace
20' to 8PM         Michael's Mirror
         Called Mr Anderson
The M clouded and there came

11391
"When I have gathered up my sails & packed
my faces up in my box which will take 
me 10 minutes I will oblige

10' to 8 PM
Mr A's here black frock coat black trousers black ground
silk waistcoat with green flowers & a black tie with lace
ends. black whiskers but no moustache
I have called you this Evening being the first opportunity 
I have had of doing so

11392
I must say you are rather neglectful

I hope you will not think that but as my time is now
& my opportunities so few that I have
seldom the opportunity of calling any one but the CA but
I assure you there is no one else whom I have so much
pleasure in seeing as yourself & I hope you will not deem
it [uncourteous?] if from any want of respect towards you

11394
dont-- dont-- you will hurt my feelings
if you go on at such a length
I hardly know which way the Lady
looked best either with the pigs foot or
the lopped ear

I do not  know what you allude to 

11395
I have got the ladys likeness with the one
earring

I ask you would leave off your idle way of poking fun
at people. -- from a remark made the other evening
by the CA I want to ask you a few questions
78

When I call you into the Mirror & appear & answer so 
promptly do you hear my call

11396
I do not.

does my Atmospheric Spirit inform you

11397
No my own does.

how then does my call reach your atmos. Spirit

11398
Through yours

then how does my At. Spt. find out & communicate with
yours so swiftly

11399
do you think they are as slow of action
as you are.

I can easily suppose that my At Sp. hears it as soon
as I call but I cannot conceive how he finds out
your At Sp. so readily

11400
how long have you thought about calling me

about an hour

11401
He could go Millions of Miles in that 
time & back

But how would my At Sp. know where to find yours

11402
The same as you would find this house
or your Seers long hall find yours

But my At Spt. does not know where to find yours 
as you travel about so much

11403
I beg leave to differ

Now Mr. Anderson I am sure you must be aware that
I do not ask these questions out of any idle curiosity
but to increase my knowledge in these curious subjects
and I must say tho you reply to my questions you
do not answer but rather seem to evade them

11404
I cannot think that you would be so
well gratified at my informing you
when there is no law that I should not 
as you will be when I give it you

My C As laughing so heartily

11405
Now for it
79

11406
My Atmospheric Spirit knows too well those 
whom I am acquainted with, and those
who are in the habit of calling me. and 
when I goes from one place to another he
goes with me
   You are a little further now

Here he laughed at me again

11407
Your At Spirit is always in communication
with mine when you wish to call me and 
before leaving he knows where we go
   Your At Spirit does not leave here 
to inform me that you want me but that 
knowledge passes from one to the other
until it reaches me.
   He could appear more readily than 
me but I could appear to you as tho
you had expressed a wish and I was here 
directly.

I replied & thanked him

[In?] some Sundays past My friend Lea & I have been
to hear Mr. T L Harris perform divine service at the
[Marylebone?] Institution & have taken the greatest Interest
in his discourses -- he will preach here till [odie?]
the [8?] of April -- he has pubd. some excellent works
on the Lyric -- the [A? Celectis?] & song of Satan leading
sermons.

11408
I know the gentleman but I did not
know him till this morning -- but I 
did not know that he had pubd. any 
books or that he was in existance till
this morning.

May I ask how you became of it

11409
I hardly know how to tell you but I
will try -- 
  I have got a great many heads
80

11409
And I am going to preserve them and
when I was warming one to fill it with 
wax. -- its Spirit Stood by the side of
me and wished me to bury it
   It was he or she I did not know which
told me in the course of [communication?] of this
Mr Harris I immediately gave my promise 
to bury the head. -- dressed myself, and
went to chapel to see this man. and to 
find out if I could in any way get an
introduction to him I will let you know
at a future time how I get on.

then I presume it was a human skull you had got

11410
It was a head like your own head
If I cut your head off I could have that
couldn't I.

but you are not a doctor -- to have bodies to dissect and
surely you never cut a Chinese Lady's head off.

11411 
It was a head of one of the Chinese and
a very nice one, and as fatty's long
half -- is half a doctor he ought to know
what I meant by filling it with wax
I hadn't a copper and made use of a 
fish kettle.

Stop a moment my friend Mr Harris does not hold
[forth?] in a chapel but in the Theatre of the Marylebone
Institution, and you could not obtain here a China
Mans head. You are quizzing us.

11412 
I told you I could travel Quick

Then it was your Atmospheric Spirit who was filling 
an Imaginary China Mans head with [ideal?] wax
Eh hows that

11413
I was busy with the head myself but
sent my At Spirit to the Chapel -- I did
not like to call in Chapel when you
81

Corrected me but I should have called it
Hall or institution I suppose.

It is held at the Marylebone Institution. [Edmond?] Sr.
[Nat?] Square

11414 
Then we both were right
My Atmospheric Spirit told me there was
a fine hubbub amongst them this morning

My friend Lea wishes to know.

11415
he might as well ask the wall whether it
saw a horse galloping by.

11416
I shall be in London this week or next week
I am coming with a party of officers 
to the opera and I think I shall stay
in town a month. I do not think I
shall stay longer.
   And if I could possibly find my way
to [Clonderley?] Terrace I would do a few
summersaults on the Balcony.

friend Lea says he should be glad to see you at [Wilm?]
Terrace & [drink?] a bottle with him

11417
O I know how to pay a Visit to him, I
only need supply my self with 1/2 a pint
of grey peas and a blower and I can 
wake him up at any time.

I shall be very glad to see you at my domicile to make 
pot luck with me

11418
I shall first meet you at a Theatre
or the Opera house.

Are will keep every appointment you may make if you
will name the Theatre & the time

11419
You had better call me on Wednesday
and I will let you know when I shall
be there.
32
My Seer will be kind Enough to inspect for me on Wednesday
do you hear my friend lea's remarks which he is now
making
11420
I can hear him a little but I do not attend
to him I only attend to the one who calls me
but if he wishes to ask any question I will
listen and answer him, I am too much
of a Gentleman not to do so—altho I am
fond of a Spree.
I explained that Mrs. Lea wished me to mention that altho
Mr Harris denounces the Spirit rapping & writing Mediums
he says nothing of Crystal work.
11421
It is little known to him
Mr h appears to be leaving
I hope you are not in haste to leave— I wished to ask you
to favor me with the relation You kindly promised
11422
I should like to givE you that on a
Thursday night but as I am going to
appear on a Wednesday I will do so then
I explained as to Mr Harris
11423
I shall be able to tell you all about him
when I havE seen him.
I thanked him & he left. 25' to 9 PM.
Feb. 24/60
Michiel's Mirror
Willon Terace
10' to 8 PM
Invoked Michiel
The [M] clouded directly and a Misty figure appeared
at a great distance and afterwards some words not
quite distinct also appeared—which became plain
11424
He will appear after the 2nd. Tuesday in March
when all the Spirits will ReceivE the New [diary?]
and orders.
83

I will then take an opportunity after that time to request
Your appearance and ask the Questions which I intended
to ask this EvEng.

11425   do so.

6' to 8 PM              Called Mr Anderson
He is here in uniform..  Black trousers thin red stripe
Scarlet coat Standing sideways
Good Evg. Mr. Anderson
|to my Seer|    What do you think of the fit

11426   It is so

I have just been informed that the Spirits of the [o?] world are
undergoing a Change of Position then dress— & that Michael
the Spirit of this M will not appear until after the 2nd
Tuesday in March — are you aware of it

11427   Yes

I can imagine that to be the Case with Mortals who lived on
this Earth. but it is strange that Spirits who have
never been Embodied — should do so

11428   they have a reason for it.  I have been
partly informed what it is.
I do not know that I am at liberty
to inform you.
Those who have been of this Earth and
those who have not will all be supplied
and undergo a Change.

he laughs & says

11429   I like them have changed my dress

My seer says you look extremely well in it

11430  Shes flattering

I cannot get over your  stuffing a China mans head
the other night --

11431  did I tell you where I had it.  I think
it was in a box
84

but you could not bring a China mans head home.  & keep
it in a fit state for injecting the wax --

11432   I beg to differ with you  it was so and 
"thereby hang a tail"

A friend has just sent me Ingredients & quantities to
prepare the powder for evoking the likeness of the dead
ment'd by Eckartshausen in his Key to Magic and by
Jung Stilling in his Theory of Pneumatology page. --
previous to using it you must fast three days.
I read it.

11433   I should say when that was taken you
would fast for ever

It is not to be taken but burnt in a Chafing dish

11434   I must enquire into this  I should not
like to try it myself.

You perceive there is no sacrifice

11435   That would make it better -- but I 
should not like to use it.

Altho the herbs are such powerful narcotics -- yet
there cannot be the same harm to be feared as by a
Sacrifice

11436   Certainly not.  yet I should fear the
Spirits which would attend that and
I am not daunted at a little

Why should you fear spirits attending these powders

11437   They are evil and of the worst kind

Now Mr Andersons rubbing the back of the M as
though his hands came through.  & he has cleaned
the face of the Mirror

May I ask what you are doing to the M

11435   Certainly every one has a right to ask
what is being done with his property
     I was about to tell you that which
I had promised
85

By the bye how many. Responses to my Questions do
you think I have received

11439
I cannot say, but I should guess a 1000

I have had 11439 besides my books.

11440 
Astounding. (throwing up both hands)

Now theres some words coming

11441
I have to make one remark before I
proceed.
   If there is any portion of
my statement. that you do not
understand you can frame the 
questions or any remark you have 
to make upon a future evening

we will keep silent during you relation

11442
I do not wish you to do that

my friend Lea's obliged to go out may I ask you
to wait 3 or 4 minutes

11443
Yes. I will leave for I must go out for
a little while and return

1/4 past 8 Mr A left.

18' past 8 Mr A is here again he looks so pale & serious

11444    The Narration
What I am about to speak of happened
to me and a friend of my own on the 25th Dec'
1859. -- we were at a party and in the 
course of ordinary conversation -- Spirits
Mesmerism & Magic was the theme of our
discourse till twelve -- We then bid our
friends good night and proposed passing
(a)  My Seer here remarked that Mr. Anderson
had turned very pale & appeared to humble
86

the rest of the time in my bed room [?]

11444
Ive again resumed our communication
I told him of several curious things
that had come under my own 
knowledge -- showed to him a lot
of my mystic books --
   While we were so occupied
I became suddenly sleepy but did
not sleep. All my limbs became
rigid and fixed -- still my friend
did not notice me -- a horrible
monster stood in front of me which
grinned at and [defied?] me --
I tried to use your exorcism but
had no power my friend still
reading on, for [I am?] giving him
out any books had given him the 
one that I keep from all mortal
Eyes. -- and through his reading it
he filled my room with monsters
of every shape and form. -- one was
visible at last to my friend who
took the form of a woman -- I in
my miserable state could hear
and comprehend all that passed
and still -- Oh horrible -- had no power

(here Mr A again shook very violently)

11444
I tried to make my friend see
the position I was in for the agony
I underwent when I knew that 
it was through neglect on my part
that he was [he?] sinking fast to
perdition --
   This horrible scene lasted till
4 oClock, when I again returned to
87

my faculties & self I found my 
friend lying on the floor with his
wrist cuff his ring off his finger
and in its place a circle made of diamonds

11444
He had plighted himself to her
and she had gone -- He was to have
been married in a month but every
time he attempted to speak to his 
bride that was to have been -- the Spirit
rose between them. He fled I knew
not whither nor how, but he appeared
to me at the foot of my bed and
informed me -- Oh horrible (there Mr.
A put his fingers in his ears & shrank 
himself up) That he had ceased to
be of this world and was undergoing
a punishment too horrible for me
to relate for his folly. --
I will leave & return

20' to 9.
[141] 9 Mr A returned & said

11445
If it was not for keeping my word
I would not have returned.

I explained, &c

11446
I only merely returned to say on
Sunday I told you I should be in
Town and shall be at Covent Garden
on the 16th when I shall anxiously
look out for you, your Seer and 
her long half.

I hope we shall be all there, we shall be in the pit
88

11447  
Take M Lees glasses with you and
your seer will soon find me out.

Pray how do you know Mr Lea has got an opera
glass.

11448  
Did he not show me round his
apartments. - I would now like now like to leave.

Will you be at Mr Harris's next Sunday or during
your stay in Town

11449  
I cannot give you a decided answer
now.

he's gone 8' to 9. pm.

Invoked the C A.
The CA's here
I was not aware of calling this evening - as next Tuesday
is the one appointed for my late dear Seer is appearing
but M L has kindly given up his evening to me

11450    
It was not Mr Leas evening for 
Calling

No, but as I am to call again next Tuesday I did
not wish to engross both. - but then I look forward
with great anxiety to meet my late dear seer in
her new dress and I must happier state

No answer

does that meet your wishes

11451    
It is so

May I ask you, if you have any advice to give me
to my Communications with her - as I do not wish
89
by any tender thought of minE to bring her mind
back again to this World.
11452
I will be with You and will influence
You what to ask.
If your friend would not mind
leaving the room. I would _ _ _ _
My friend Lea has now left.
11453
I am aware of it and already your
Seer is passing ovEr. — I ask you to
pass your hand as usual — Your
right —
I have done so and now wait your Commands
11454
And I am waiting till the Seer is
sufficiently passed away.—
11453
In calling your late seer I do not
wish you to speak of your world
she does not cease to recollect you or
your Seer. I wish I could make it so—
11456
It was not decreed that either you or
Your present Seer should have suffered as
you have done.— but that will soon
pass away. — the power your present
Seer has of inspecting has always been
her own. I interceded with Mr Leas
Guardian Spirit to givE that power
to your late Seer. and I was content
for I not only gavE you the opportunity
of gaining information from our world
But I was able to Converse with you
That was my wish why you should
havE resided in the house with your
90
present Seer. —
I wish that could EvEn be so now
I ask you on next Tuesday Evening to
inform your late Seer that you havE
forgotten her — yet regret her wish
respect to your Mirror— that will
entirely from her mind = I think I
ought to havE said thought.

I replied her happiness was Ever uppermost in my thoughts

11457
do you wish me to be more explicit

I will say that her Eternal happiness is all that
I am concerned for her about her. you surely do
not wish to me say that I do not regret her loss.

11458
that is not what I mean
She departed from your world to
Another. with the belief[e] that you
had a worldly Affection for her. I
have tried to undeceive her but havE
not succeeded.
Am I understood now.

Yes. but I am still at a loss in what way to
frame my Questions or observations to her

1459
I will frame it for you as far as I
am able.
I do not wish You to do more than this.
Say You have only one Regret and that
is with respect to Your mirror.

I will say to her that I hope She will forget all
Connected with this Earth. — And ask her if She is
91

happy & if she says yes then I will say, then
I shall have only one regret & that is in respect to
my mirror.

11460
I thank you that is my wish

I presume then she will have the M

11461
I shall influence her to do that
and all power over you will cease.

It will be painful to me but I must in God that
all will be for the best.

11462
I shall only do that which is right
if I ceased to do that I should cease 
to be your guardian Spirit.

11463
While your Seer is in this state I will
give you the new addition I shall wear
on my next appearance.

11464
From my Crown to my Wings will be
a chain of precious stones.

11465 She returns

My Seer passed back -- Then left.

May I make a few observations for your opinion

11466 
You can do so

On Sunday the 4th [?] I attend M Harris's both
morning & evening -- In the Evening I saw repeatedly
a light between Mr Harris & the wall & [at the] towards
the end of his discourse -- after he had been standing with
his hands held up and his head for some time
upon his suddenly turning to his reading deck I
92

unmistakeably but very much taller than M Harris
for some seconds or 2 minutes. like a figure
with loose dress standing in the same position
as Mr Harris had been in remember I did not
see every figure but only a luminous form -- was
that may I ask Spiritual -- or an optical illusion

11467
You will not see that light again

May I ask why not as I am so exceedingly interested
in his discourses --

No answer

Mr. Harris's discourses which he started were
delivered immediately by the Spirit are exceedingly
interesting to me -- & I hope I shall not miss any
of the remaining ones as he leaves on the 9th April next

11468
I hope your Seer will be with you
the following Sunday.

11469
I think I have explained that now
away

11470
I have a wish that she should take 
the Talisman that is attached to
this Mirror with her -- You can carry
it till you reach there, let her place
it on the right side of her dress towards 
the Shoulder and return it to you before
leaving

I thank you we will attend to your wishes

On Sunday week Dr [Ashburner?] mentioned to me
that he had a patient whom he was mesmerizing 
for Cancer & explained a strong wish that he could
have "the aid of my will and mesmeric force."
Now I owe Dr [Ashburner?] so much for his kindness

93

In coming to Croyden to see my late dear Seer
without any change -- besides the respect which 
I have had for him ever since I had the pleasure
of making his Acquaintance that if it met your
[appar?] I should like to assist him

11471
Under existing circumstances I would
rather that you should not.

Certainly may I ask your opinion as to this -- (Lea [Th?])

11472
Another time.

As to my ill health

11473
Yes all will pass away
All things will work together for their 
good.

As to a Vision if convenient & agreeable

11474
After next Tuesday I think you may 
have all you wish.

9 PM.

O Mar 11th 1860

11475
At Mr Harris's Morning & Eveg Service

In the Eveing Mr Lea accompanied me & Lea to The
Institution "The Evening Sermon "Beauty." My
Seer placed the CA Seal as directed -- the [discourses] Service
commenced at 1/2 past 6.

Upon Mr Harris's Entrance he was 
accompanied by his GS dressed as [ideal?]
& took up his place behind Mr Harris apparently
setting up above the gas stand at the back
where he remained till nearly the end of the 
sermon

The words "mother [Hope?]" were on their fronts or
rather in front of them.
94

Shortly after two Spirits came in one
in white edged with blue (Mr Harris's mother)
and one all in white (Mr Harris's late wife) both
of them stood on Mr Harris's right side

On Mr Harris's left side there came 
5 Evil Spirits or rather Evil looking mortals -- dressed 
as at present in different colored cloathes one in [blk?]
one in brown & they looked like [cremated?] corpses 
& appeared to be mocking and jeering at what
he said altho in motion & talking they did not
appear life like & kept skipping & moving about
the 5 were all men -- one tried to stop Mr Harris's 
mouth & Mr Harris immediately threw out his
hand against him & at the same moment Mr H's 
GS seemed to drop the end of his wing right
between them. then all the 5 went off and
then they came back again and brought a coffin
with them & put it close against Mr Harris and
then laughed and jeered at him again then they
got it a little further and beckoned him to come
into it and Mr Harris smiled & put his out
against them then one of the 5 put out his
hand & tried to clutch Mr Harris [& p] & Mr H put
up both his hands and fell back. & looked as
though [it was] they were disgusting to him.
When Mr H was speaking about his mother 
these evil Spirits held up red words "we defy you"
and he then took up that subject when he spoke
of the Spheres all the Wall in the eight side
as high up as the clock disappeared & there 
were 7 great spaces 4 at the bottom & 3 at
the top. All the spaces were circular and at
the top & at the top was all one beautiful luminous
space of light [coated?] all over of beautiful colors
when he finished his sermon and before his
95

Guardian Spirit left he came from his place
at the back & took a horizontal position spreading
out his wings an [immense?] way. & underneath
his wings appeared to hang drops of many
colored stones and as he passed he took suddenly
from his belt a stone as large as the Japan Crystal
& cast it down & at it front the prayer appeared 
to come out of it --

Thelon Terrace

11' past 8 PM      CAM
Invoked the CA

From many circumstances which had risen during the past
year- & [1/2?] -- from the fact that on                a Spirit
calling himself the CA & assuming himself to be my GS.
Appearing to my present Seer I was Earnestly desirous on
an occasion so important to my self as this the last 
[endeavor?] with my late dear Seer. ELL to be as certain as
a mortal could possibly expect to be that the CA
who appeared to my present Seer was the same that 
had formerly appeared to my late dear. I therefore
for the first time used "The Great Expression" a spell
of great power agt. [invading?] Spirits -- I took every
precaution I could think of to insure my not
being deceived -- 
Are you -- -- -- -- --

11476
I am
None other would dare to appear. 
96

I used the [heat?] Exorcism

11477
I am the Same

As this is the Evening to call my late dear Seer may I 
ask when I shall call her

11478
I will leave in two minutes from this
then you can call her.

In the box mirror or in this

11479
You can call her now in this mirror
which your Seer is inspecting

I presume this will be the last time of her 
appearing

11480
I cannot say it will be the last 

Shall I se

11481

After my dear Seer has appeared I will invoke you
to appear again

11482
do so

18' past 8 PM Called my dear Seer ELL.
See my ELL MS.

1/4 to 9 PM Invoked the CA

The CA is here come in from the right side
he has been there all the time I should think 
there was a light in that side all the time dear Emma
was here -- & as Emma left the CA came in

I explained at great length my reasons for using the 
Exorcisms to clear away my remaining doubts

11483
You rather [grieved?] me at having so much
doubt. Still I do not blame you
I know Evil is so ready to appear.

I expressed my thanks [acknowled?] I had received 
many valued Spiritual gifts -- many protecting 
97

warnings & above all the books I prized so much
and while I am a Servant of the most 
High may I have the power of carrying
you higher and higher till you have
reached that [home?] from whence no
traveller returns.

[I?] thanks

11485
I have a few words to say to your Seer
may I be allowed to do so

My Seer will be happy to receive your advice

11486
I wish then that she would exert
herself to expel those low feelings which
oppress her nervous system. I am
almost at a loss to find words to make
myself understood. -- But the Father
of all goodness & mercies does not wish
you or any mortal to be unsociable
and dull because you seek after his
truths -- They are simple & easily
to be understood by all.

11487
This is the law he lays down
put your trust in Him, pray to be saved
through his Son Jesus Christ to be
a believer in the Holy Ghost, to believe
that he sent his Son to die for you
and for all mortals -- do this and
that is all that will be required of
you.

11488
Will you say that you have understood
me.

I thank you & perfectly comprehend your meaning &
will explain them to my Seer -- because in her present
state they pass from her mind as soon as spoken
98

11489
You will write them out if you please
And give them to her.

I explained as to my misgivings

11490
We shall progress on better when all
those doubts Are removed from her
mind

May I ask if you were present whilst my late seer
was here

11491
Yes I was near you.

I hope my Remarks to my late dear Seer satisfied you

11492
Yes. She will go on progressing Now
and forget.

And I must strive to forget her.

11493
You must try to forget, but if you
ask me on my Every 4h time of
Appearing to you I shall be enable
to inform you how she [is] progress[ing]

I thank you you are indeed most kind

Mr Lea requests you will be kind Enough to inform
Eltesmo : Why Mr Lea is prevented Calling him
this Evening

11494
Yes I am glad you mentioned it. I
will do so.

the thoughts that my dear Seer has happily Entd.
her first State. will be a Constant Source of Comfort
to me.

11495
Now She has left you , you will both
go on well

My Seer here remarked that she felt a little absent

11496
I think as your Seer is a "little upset"
I had better not stay longer but
will do so if you wish it

As to my father

11497
I think I [also] informed that he also
99

will soon pass away

I explained as to my Doubts being dispelled

11498
I think you will find you will
have no room to doubt.

11499   Odie March 18th. 1860

Odie [mung?] at Mr Harris' "The [heath?] of Heart" in
the Evening "Genius" Mr & Mrs. Lea present.

Mrs. Lea observed that when Mr Harris commenced 
his text his GS (dressed as before) stood at the back
and after a little while a golden cord an inch thick
came slanting down from the right of Mr H -- & rested
on the table in front of him remained so for a long 
time while the singing was going on there were
seven Spirits at Mr Hs right -- dressed in white & pink
white and blue and white & purple. robes who appd.
also to be singing like the purple the white & pink
& white & purple had gowns -- the white & blue had come
& after the singing they went away. & when Mr. H
began his sermon the CA stood by the rope holding 
it by one hand -- but high above Mr H. & from him
emanated a ray of light to Mr Harris's Ears -- by
which he received the words of the Sermon. -- Then
all the red curtains at the back of Mr H became
as it were Mirrored with a beautiful light filled 
with myriads of lovely spirits of all sizes some only
3 or 4 inches long others much larger than mortals but all
equally distinct perfect & beautiful -- clothed in various
colors -- during the sermon when Mr. H spoke agt
the [Calvinistic d? of Station?] 2 spirits in black
gowns which darted at him & appeared to sieze 
Mr H. by the throat but just at that moment

100
Mr [Hains?] GS. appeared to sieze the Golden Card with
both hands & dart like lightning & the 2 spirits fell
back and when Mr H. said the Calvinists made
God [?] than man.  they defied him to repeat it
& he said it again directly & then Mr H. folded his
arms & repeated it. -- the words they defied him with
appeared like printing on a white cloud in part of
them.  across their chests   after that they went away
& Mr. H's guardian spirit stayed till the session
ended and then he threw down the Crystal ball as
before  which appeared to open & the prayer a
very short one came out   & the GS fled away as
before

    during this session Mr Anderson came in &
perched himself just in front of Mr H's table over
the glass.   He then got down & stepping over the seats
sat himself down between Mr Lea & my seer & 
began nodding & laughing at her. -- he then got up
& sat by the side of me.  still nodding & laughing
every now & then at my seer & then went away.

At Mr Harris's Sermon Edward H. [P?]

Mrs. Lea dis not put on her glasses until the Sermon began
& observed Mr Harris' GS taking his usual place at
the back & above the chair & in a sitting posture & Mrs. Lea
did not observe any thing more until Mr Harris spoke
of the fashionable shops jutting back upon the squalid 
& miserable tenements of the poor Then the shops
became visible to her -- a jewellers, a linen drapers
& others and at the end an eating house. when 3 or 4
very ragged children looking in at the windows and
at each others with longing eyes. then several ladies 
passed by very fashionably dressed and appeared
as tho they were going into the jewellers shop and
took up their dresses as tho they feared to touch 
the ragged urchins as they passed -- then the
children turned round and gazed at them very
admiringly

Then came a good spirit dressed in white 
edged with blue with wings seemed to make some 
passes over the children and they turned away
from the eating house & ran into a [court?] & seemed
to play about as tho they had forgot the other
scene. -- then this all vanished

Mrs Lea then for a long time did not observe
any thing until Mr Harris began describing the
miseries & the doom of such miserable wretches as
were lost when a great number of Spirits appeared 
some picking each others pockets -- siezing each
other & hitting them -- some holding sharp 
instruments and acting as though they were
going to cut each others throats -- old [miners?] with
103

long bony hands counting Gold with their skeleton
fingers -- without flesh -- counting over their Gold
so covetously and [Hot?] there was an appearance 
on their countenance as though they loathed it
Then when Mr Harris spoke of fallen women
appearing as serpents there appeared a great.
number of different forms of serpents & hideous
figures with female faces some very beautiful
yet frightful = & with hideous & diabolical
laughter on their faces at the mortals who
appeared to come fresh amongst them & yet they
seemed waiting upon them in every form.

Then a veil fell all over them and
then there was a Vision of Evil Spirits in mortal
form and dress -- then 3 Spirits came in
apparently in their shrouds all white -- & here Mr.
Harris appeared to have lost himself [together?]
where he was -- When suddenly the word exorcism
came & he held his his hand & did so and 
then the Mortal Spirits fell back and his GS
came between them & Mr Harris & stood between
them -- then Seven Spirits came from Mr
Harris's right side across Mr Harris & they put
the three Spirits in Shrouds in the middle
of them & Mr Harris's GS came in front then
there was 3 on each side and one behind
and they all floated away carrying with
them the 3 Spirits in Shrouds --

The whole of the 7 & Mr Harris' GS were
singing & Mr Harris said "Yes I hear a voice &
 you are welcoming a [hither home?]. and they 
all went away to his right -- then Mr H's GS 
came back again to Mr Harris who appeared
mentally praying & turned M Harris [w?]
the audience when he went on with his address
104

at the end of the Sermon his GS dropped the
stone in front of him & the prayer came out and
his GS floated away.

[Maybl?] Institution
Mr Harris Evening Service

When Mr Harris came in as usual & knelt his
GS came in with him & took his seat above the
lamps behind Mr H's chair and Mr H turned to
the Clerk when saying the prayers & the visions were
forming at the back -- he then began the sermon
when giving the lesson Mr. Harris's right hand
 goes down the page until he comes to where
he begins to read & there it stops [d?] the
[d? w?] saying that Evil Spirits had no
home & in Evil Spirit women who were dead
I saw a number of deceased person on [ant?]
[cr?] in his left side and a number of good 
Spirits with wings between them & his GS. then one
of the deceased mortals a woman had her name
come as part of her [Autor?] She had got on a
black knit dress and a brown jacket no head
dress but looked like one out of dress she was
crying to the Spirits above her to sare her -- as
she was looking for a home.

Then there was the Spirit of a lower order
and his name come on a kind of [heart plate?]
in front of him [SUZY?] he moved & came off at
the part of the platform right in front of us
and said call me

Then I saw many good Spirits & they

105

went in and out among all the Evil Spirits who
appeared of all [co?] and the good spirits
singled out one here and there & took them
away.

Then Mr Harris said some thing about
serpents when he hit his heart there appeared
a large snake I should think 9 or 10 feet
long with a human head and that was 
marked on the shiny part Satan then this
serpent seemed to half left itself up and 
appeared speaking to Mr Harris but not words
only rays of fire appeared to come out of its 
mouth.

Then there appeared on the other side
the platform 5 children in white dresses edged
with blue no wings who were dancing then there
was 6 more children they had white dresses 
with a gold band round the waist with curly
fair hair and gold bands round their heads
white wings edged with gold and they were
singing --

Then I lost all of them then when
Mr Harris spoke of the rich men that lived in
pomp and said those men had no homes
when he turned round and said he would take
us to a -- -- then there came a Vision
of a large mansion and every room filled with 
people & serpents and then the company sitting
down & coming & [s?] and drinking [time?] &c
then he said that man had no home then on
Mr Harris right came a cottage made of tarred
wood red tiles 2 or 3 windows painted white
and there was the husband [dying?], he was in bed
there was his wife and 3 children kneeling 
at the bed side praying -- there was a good 
106

Spirit at his head & one over Each Child & also over
the mother and two Evil Spirits at the foot close
by the door then there came between them but
no words -- it appeared as tho he asked for
something which they had not got to give him
then the wife seemed to look so [desparing?] like
round the room and then the good Spirits appeared 
to pass his hand down over the dieng mans head
and smooth it and cast a ray of light all
over the mother and children -- then the two Evil
Spirits they had things in their hands like bottle
and glasses which they went towards him as 
tho going to give to him but his GS came
between them and they fell back and went
outside the door. -- and then Mr Harris said 
That man had a home --

When Mr H said a curtain should fall
down at night with all the stars &c.

Then there appeared the curtain which came
a large white curtain filled with Golden Stars
two corners of which were held by 2 Spirits
who appeared to fly down with it so as to
[Speak it ande open?]. They had each a golden
trumpet in their hands.

When Mr Harris spoke of the Wanderer
then there appeared an old man bowed down
with age leaning on a long shaft with him was all
kinds of Evil Spirits -- the words came down the
side of him he is a [deromer?]. then I [cost?] him
Then I had a Vision of 1117 Harris The last & the
rise The first the last the rise the home, to
the first came a boy he looked about 4 years old
a book on his lap in front of him came
"Seeking after the ways of truth" the last
"impeaching" 
the rise his good spirit with his spirit.--
The home" the Guardian Spirit this home.
107 

When Mr Harris gave a description of the man 
he had seen in his Carriage there came the Miser 
in his Counting house sitting in front of his Iron safe 
at his side his Clerk “the Clerk asking him for a 
rise in his wages” “he refuses” then there came his 
home with Evil spirits and the words “in home” 
then came his Clerks home scarcely furnished 
but very clean & looked very happy he went to 
the cupboard & took out a slice of bread, & about 
a teaspoonful of tea & caned it up in a bit of paper 
beside him came “going out to tea with a sick 
friend” & his wife was there & that went --

(There came a picture of a man in his Carriage  
fair & very like FH. he was looking out of the 
Carriage laughing & nodding to some pretty 
women—over the Carriage there appeared an old 
man very [ver] like him who appeared to be 
gazing with satisfaction at what was going on 
then there came between the top Spirit and the 
Carriage. —His home is death & hurrying his 
children into perdition") 

then Mr Harris spoke of the poor Temptress
then she appeared going up to a Counter 
for work and then there appeared a very fine 
man who was bowing to her and she started 
at him—and then he politely bowed her in 
behind the Counter then I lost them for a Minute 
then there was a warehouse [man?] going out work 
with a large pair of shears in his hand 
then the girl came back and she appeared very
dull and very unhappy & then the master said 
give her not more work—but the Clerk as 
he let her out at the door gave her a Shilling
108

then came The home No home"

Then the GS did not give Mr Harris
a stone for the prayer but a triangle & on it came
[Trine?], and he gave the prayer

When Mr Harris said he had seen Our Saviour
An immense space seemed to appear like the [?]
and then a figure came so bright that I could 
not keep my eyes upon it which seemed sitting
above a splendid high place, and our Saviour
was standing at the foot who showed Mr Harris
a room of all kinds & sorts of Angels of all
imaginable beauty & grandeur but as Mr Harris
said he could not repeat what he felt, so I
cannot explain what I saw.

Our saviour appeared with very dark hair
and very plain features and there appeared a
beautiful slope coming down and all the Angels
[houses?] right and left -- all numbered through
the 7 Spheres -- here some [heer?] -- there large [?]
& then all kind of musical instruments. [?]
were being played they did not seem to speak to
each other but in each of their chests there appeared
like a Crystal glass and they appeared to see each
others thoughts instead of talking -- they walked 
about some planting trees -- some sitting up in 
the trees -- some [drawing?] -- some writing -- some dancing
Every thing I could think of seemed [?] done
when that passed away our Saviour came down &
then there appeared an Evil Spirit as if tempting him
& J.C. waved his hand and the Spirit fell back
& then I saw 4 [?] who put him on the Cross and
then by the Evil Spirit there came

"They would lead you to believe that this did not
exist" -- & when Mr Harris spoke of the [pa?] there
appeared the whole of the Crucifixion H.

Invoked Michael 
The mirror became dark and in a ray
of light there appeared 

11509
"One fortnight from this"

Can I see Mr Anderson

11510
You can call him

Called Mr. Anderson
he appeared instantly black [h?] coat [waistct?], blue
tie but no hat on.

Good evening Mr Anderson I wish to ask you a few
questions can I do so

11511
You can.

My Seer has not been able to have any Visions in
the Mirror since the 13th last March -- has it been 
so with you

11512
Yes it is so with Every one, did not
your own CA tell you it would be so

No can you tell me the cause

11512
They have all been feasting & yet
falling

at this he laughed
111
What do you mean by that
1[5]1514
they have been feasting themselves with
prayer. , and fasting with Every thing
Esle besides
I was afraid my Seer had lost her faulty
11515
O no. She has not done that and
I thought as they could not appear
I might have been called.
I have not had the pleasure of being
so near the lady since I was at chapEl
I havE a bone to pick with you — for not appearing to
us at the Opera the night you appointed
11516
If you had said pluck a pigeon it wd.
have been more Gentlemanly.—but I
beg your pardon I was there.
Your Seer saw me.
According to our suggestionn I took Lea's Opera Years
& almost unscrewed my neck looking about after you
11517
I am aware of it I should have remained
in the front of the box Your Seer saw me in
but the lady who I was with has a
very great regard for me (placing his
hands on his heart)
I suppose You did not hear mE Singing
on your balcony
We were at Mr Harris's in the [27] What do you
think of him — he will be there again on the 27th May
11578
—He is a very nice man and I will by
& be those of course Your Seeress will be
there and I shall be delighted to see her
especially if she will leavE off that dark
dress and wear a light one.
I was Exceedingly gratified by your Cast Relation was
I must say in spite of your Bad manners — the

112

the relations you favor me with are exceedingly
interesting

11519
The next one I give you will be of a lively
description -- it will be the visit of me & a 
friend to the Sea Sid.

I have long promised a lady friend of mine to give
her a seance with my Mirror & Crystals to her &
a party of her young friends -- at her house at Paddington
but then delay in any Vision has prevented my
[doing so?] -- as it is so long since I have used my
Crystals for my Seer. That I am not certain if the
Spirits still have charge over them

11520

The Spirit of Your Crystal has still
his power over it, [if he [?]] and you 
can use it -- if they had not I should 
not be able to stand here

Now he has set [firmly?] down with his legs right out
but theres nothing under him

But I wished to [book?] the Spirits of the M & Cs if the Young
Ladies who were there could "See" -- which I always do
by letting them take my Seers hand -- & the Spirits then
tell me do you understand.

11521
I do
but I could do that for me.

I think you are poking fun at me

11522
No I am not

because I have often asked you to appear under these
circumstances & you have not done so -- of course [we?] shall
be very glad if you will appear

11523
I will do myself the honor.

I intended to take this Mirror -- my Japan Crystal
my ES. Crystal & the [die?] Crystal & [J?]
desirous if asking whether we could have Visions
in them. as other several are desirous of looking
113
It is so tedious to keep them waiting with only one
Crystal to use.
11524
I will send a message to ask I do not
know that I shall be answered.
Now he has gone out.
In two minutes | he's come [???ing] in out of health.
Well you have returned so quick you cannot havE
been far.
11525
I beg to differ I am out of breath running
how do you think I had better arrange.
11526
You would be able to havE visions in two Crystals but not in the unconsecrated
one and in this Mirror
I will then appoint some day after this day
fortnight
11527
I should prefer Wednesday Evening
Then I will name Wednesday fortnight
11528
You could go tomorrow week.
But it would not make any different if I wEnt
the Week following
11529
I should be Engaged in that day
Then I would make it next Thursday or Friday fortnight
11530
I must leavE you to do as you please
dont be Cross I only wished to havE the Spirits assurance
that we should havE visions as my Seer has been
unable to see so long.
11531
I havE just now told you it has been no
fault of your Seer.
But if the spirits Could not appear [h???] is you so readily
Came
11532
I had a message to say— Your Seer could
Not See and you was anxious that I
should appear if I could do so
Then I will appoint Wednesday week
11533
I think you will not regret it
Present Mrs. [Dreav?]
           Mrs. Robinson
           Miss Barclay
           Miss [Aerie?] Cunningham
           Miss
           Mrs. Lea & Self.
114

My Seer of course will be with me

11533
It would be little use You and I being
there if she was out.

Then we will consider the appointment made

11534
then if you will not be angry I will
leave

Then I will take this M the Japan C and the ESC

11535
Yes you are right

8.23 PM  CA Mirror
Invoked the CA

The CA's here 

I thank you &c. may I ask the [chance?] of my Seer with
having been able to see you for so long a time

11548
There are portions of time allotted to
Spirits to improve themselves and also
for changing their orders and abodes
and also for Spirits who have been doomed
for long periods & several punishments to
lead them to a better and a happier 
state

For about a fortnight after my late dear Seers last
appearance I was surprisingly better but [?] my
head has been & [?] very bad

11549
As my influence is back with you 
and greater than since your late Seer
went away I think you will recover.

May I ask you kindly to impregnate again my
last Seal.

11550
It is done breathe on it

A ray of light came from over the pit of the CA's [stomache?]
will you also [revivify?] the Solar Seal

11551
It is done

The CA made the form of a Cross with the light from 
his finger upon it --

May I ask you again to impregnate them before I
leave London & for that purpose I will request you to do it
on Tuesday before I leave --

11552
I will do so but if you leave before, and
you will call me I will do it then. I
should prefer you having it about you
when you start.

I am sorry to say my Seer still complains of much
117 
Pain in her Eyes after inspecting 11553 
That will pass away 
I am sorry my Communion with you has been since 
very late dear Seer death So ineguler Shape on 
my return to London—to commence a more regular 
choice of Communion 
11554 
There will be noting to prevent Ms Lea 
inspecting Every Tuesday Evening 
I look most anxious by forward to receive either the 
4th book you so kindly promised the or the one you 
last referred to for front location 
11555

To have it as Soon____________
Mr H has refused GS had the pleasure of hearing him last O die

Since we last met I have [closed?] my acquaintance 
with Mr K Mackenzie

11562
It is as well.

May I ask if you have any advice to give me for my
guidance.

11563
Only to be careful with respect to your living 
while you are away. do not take wine
take Spirit with cold water.

As to my seeing Dr. Garth Wilkinson --

11564
I do not think you will have any
occasion to see him.
place your head in front of the Mirror 
hold it down 
That will do

(When I held my head down my Seer said there is
a light comes from his open hand direct to your head
which appears thusly Mirrored I can see every lit
up -- They appear to have hollow tubes in them -- Every one
of them and I can see the skin of your head & every 
separate hair down to the roots.)

[I returned?] thanks

I hope when I return to again receive my Commun.
with you as I did in my late Seers time. It vexes
me much to be so [irregular?]

11565
We shall get on as well as we did when 
your late Seer was with you
but you must bear in mind that it
was not done in a hurry even then

It will then I hope dispel my present unpleasant
mental struggles
119

11566

I am aware of all you feel as well 
as you are -- and I shall be as happy
to give you the books/ as you will be
to receive them.

[?die] June 3 1860
Evening Service
When mr Harris Came in his GS came in with him
and took his usual place ovEr the lamps and remained
there till after the prayer and singing was ovEr.
the first thing I saw was a very large Tre in front
of M Harris , there were fruit upon it but not like
any I ever Saw, — yellow fruit. then a figure came
in a white loose dress very long. hair rather reddish
with sandals on his feet. he leant his back agt
the Tree . — then another figure Came in a Woman
in a purple dress her hair hanging own loose. fair
hair. — She stood on the other side of the Tre
and remained there some time , then came a
Strange form, like a Mist at first and then assumed
all kinds of forms — then something like a serpent
or rather a Crocodile with human face — then this
monster appeared to talk to the Woman and both
RemovEd from The Tree. Then the Man (Adam) put
out his hand to feel for her, and then I saw he
Could not see her— then Eve Returned and this
monster went & twisted himself up the tree round &
round the Trunk. then there Came — across the
whole of the picture a Vision just abovE Adam + Eves
Chests
11570
"Our first Parents"
When Mr Harris Spoke of People in a
Trance— I saw such a young & beautiful girl
laying in a Coffin but with such a splendid Evening
dress on. then there Came a Spirit in a white
dress with wings and belt.— then Came the words
between the spirit and the Coffin
"She sleeps but not the sleep of death"
And the Spirit movEd he face and She opened
her Eyes — and that Vanished.
121

11571 Then came a bed and I saw the figure of
a very handsome girl   dark  hair laying in the bed
dieing   the words "dieing" came over her  her Guard'n
Spirit was at her head - the same as the C A. with
white and purple robes  then there seemed to be
a struggle within her as tho passing away.  and
her guardian spirit told her
     "It is a sleep to awake to a land of light"
Then I saw just above the pit of the stomach a
bright gold light which passed up to her throat
and [?] all her head and she appeared to
breathe till  it came about level with her Eyes.
When her [?] suddenly dropped and the light
went out of the Crown of her head and it took
the exact form of the girl -- but no clothes on.  and
her spirit and her Guardian Spirit went away 
together.

     When Mr. Harris spoke of his belief = there
came 3 evil spirits who defied him  and offered 
to strike at him with knives - then Mr Harris's
G.S. put the words.
     "I defy thee but strike".
And they did strike one on the right collar  done
with a dagger.  and the other at his back  then
Mr Harris's GS. appeared to lift Mr. H. up by the
hair of his head and Mr Harris then became straight
with his fists clenched & arms straight down beside
him. -- then Mr H. turned round and smiled
and they all went away.
     When Mr H spoke of different trades & 
tradesmen & their practices to obtain gain & profit, their
appeared a number of tradesmen all sitting in a row
as many as 20  with bags of money before them

122

& some were busy counting them out and all their
fingers were only bones without flesh upon them.

11572    When Mr Harris spoke of the Profligate
I saw such a fine handsome fellow -- and then there
appeared six very beautiful women -- his victims but
they had become Spirits -- though they looked just
like women at first and they changed to Spirits
3 on each side as he went between them. - he had
and Evil Spirit along with him. -- and the women said
   "Forsake him thou Evil one  leave him to us
   "that by watching & praying we may bring him
   "back to GoD."
but they both gave a diabolical laugh and away
they went.

     Just before the sermon concluded Mrs. Lea
was going to take her glasses off  a light came & the words
   "Keep them on  had  the talisman in your right
   "hand till you get outside"

   When Mr Harris said he gave freely and
was oftentimes at a loss  but money came to him. - then
his GS went out as though through the Ceiling  then he
came back as it were by the door.  and brought
with him another Spirit in front of whom was
                " A Ministering Spirit"
then that spirit changed to the form of a mortal
who had money in his hands and he went up to
a spirit  the exact counterpart of Mr Harris -- as the
Spirit changed you could see the veins forming
and filling and taking as it were a mortal life

     When [?]. spoke of the Railway Accident
I say the Railway Train and every passenger  even to 
123
to the Stoker had a GS. with him  Good & Evil
two  to Each person, the Evil Spirits had all dark
hair and dusky countenances.  and seemed to fly as
swift and Even to guide  the  Train whilst the good
Spirits had each a hand upon the neck of Each
person.  I saw the spirits  without the train first, but
they came so quick  I could not see how they Came

11573     In the midst of the discourse when speaking
of Penticost — I saw the same Vision over again of the
Jews and the palm tree — when our Saviour came in
the midst of all these Jews.  and whilst the jews were
praying as before   there came a great many persons
of all nations outside of the Jews and Jesus appeared
talking to them and they appeared  astonished and
they also fell down & began praying  & then it vanished

          Mr. Andersons AS. was there as usual
by the Table legs —

          when Mr Harris spoke of its being wrong
to hanker after wealth. and gave the description of
the two men.  who began both alike  then Mr Anderson
Came off  the platform  right in front of HDL. and
laughed at him and said. "There you should
not wish to have riches"  and  then disappeared.

          towards the close of the discourse which
Mr H. was just going to close  his GS. gave
him a stone with the prayer  and he was going
to conclude when his  GS  went quickly across.
his face with his hand and Mr H then Continued
the discourse for some time — that was when the
light came for me to keep the glasses on

H
On Sunday last we attended Mr Harris's ministration
& heard an Excellent discourse upon the necessity of our
fixing our faith in Christ. — there were many Spiritual
Apparitions to C.A. particularly Adam [?] in the 
Vision of Adam & EvE the figures wore clothes & the Seer
remarked that Adam [?] out his hand towards
Eve as though blind — Are we to understand that A
& E had not the blessing of Sight.
11575
They had not that gift
"
then did they receive Sight after they had Sinned
11576
they did
How is it they appeared clothed Especially with Sandals
which must havE been an after invention.
11577
No answEr
havE I made myself Sufficiently understood because
I havE always Considered they were Naked & were not
aware of it until after they had sinned
11577
No Answer
havE you any objection to answer my Question as
to the dress and the Sandalls.
11577
No AnswEr
As Mr Harris is now [?] for Good we hope to form
a society Could you favor us with discourses which I
could read to them . & my friend H. also receivE Some
from his GS. the C.A.
11578
It would be what neither of you
would be able to carry out
Can you Suggest any means by which the Congregation
125
Could be kept together
11579
there will be another who will Appear
Among you
HS
Mr Harris some time since mentioned that one or two
would probably be amongst us,— & the affecting way
in which he mentioned his Trust in GOD as to his own
Suffering future Carried his Audience Entirely with

My friend Lea has Stated CorEctly the Seers vision
may I ask are we to understand taht Adam &
Eve were created blind
11585
They were.
[*To H*] 126

Then how could Adam give names to the Beasts
Birds &c. which names in Hebrew according to the 
Cabalists express certain of their qualities

11586
He put out his hand & touched them

Then if Adam was blind how could he perceive 
the difference between the trees, because we understand
from Genesis he was to eat of every thing except the 
Tree of Good and Evil.

11587
Adam & Eve were created to be immortal
if they had been mortals as yourself they
would have seen as you do

Are we to understand that in their first state they
were blind as to their organic vision -- but that
their Spiritual sight existed -- but after their sin
and fall their organic vision was opened

11589
you are right

I thank you as the answer stood it appeared absurd
but now you have explained it it assumes great 
interest as I had thought the Scriptures meant
that when Adam had [sinned?] the expression
"his eyes were opened" meant his Spiritual Sight
& not his organic sight -- I hope you are not 
offended at my asking this in a doubting Spirit

11590
You are right but you must be aware
there are many Spiritual things 
which the comprehension of man cannot
understand.

Will on Jenace 
I looked the C.A. 
The CA is hear. 
As to any sorry to the North requesting the LA to impregnate 
My talismans 
It is done 
As to the telesm for my head. 
11592 
I think when you are away you had 
better attach a small ribbon to it and 
let it hand at the back of you neck 
Shall the telesm to the M & the LA. Brought his face nearly to it 
11593 
It is done but in your return it must be worn in your hat 
as to my objection to wear his last telem with the Name____ under my foot 
11594 
Why. 
because I do not like thus to head the name ____ 
under foot.__ 
11595 
If your faith is strong in him, and 
you rely on him—does it matter in 
what part of your body you carry your name. 
Abstractedly is does not, practically it does: at least 
in own Capueal state. 
11596 
As a Servant of the lord I gave you 
that to prevent your Shuribling 
then I will lean it as you with 
11597 
Wear it and be strong in your faith 
As to a certain Business matter 
11598 
I do not see that there is anything 
for you to trouble yourself about. 
As to my living & dying in the north. 
11599 
do not drink wine=but take spirits 
I do not remember to what this referred
128 
with cold water but while you are 
away do not take spirits with hot 
water and sugar upon any Account 
You may take it with cold water & 
Should prefer your taking spirits with 
Cold water and no beer or wine while 
you are from home. 
And another thing that you should 
carefully avoid for the next six weeks 
taking fat of any kind 
I will do as you wish tho I am very partial to 
fat of all kinds 
11600 
I should like you to Eat all the lean of the meat and leave the fat. 
I will deal as far as I possibly can up to your 
kind instructions 
11601 
It is only while you are from home. 
And I think on your return You will 
find yourself a better and a happier man. 
I thank you. 
My regret at Ms Harris bearing England, I never 
look any think like the same interest in any 
other Ministration— 
11602 
He will return to England once more. 
The C.A pae appeared to place his hand out all over my head. 
11603 
I have assured you 
As to Mr. Harris other on the last mosey thing Since 
to Baptize & preform the sacrament to any of 
his heavens—& respective of freeds—if they Sincerely 
feel themselves. Desnons &e. &e of taking it 
129 
11604 
He would not be preaching the word 
of his Master if he denied Sincere 
repentant Sinners to receive that. 
for He taught sinners that they 
might learn from their wickedness 
and live. 
11605 
There you are right 
Our Savior wished it to be done in 
remembrance of him. but I am aware 
There are few mortals who could take 
it with a fall assonance that they 
would be saved in him & by him 
11606 
When he said do this in remembrance 
of me. it was that they would be just in every thought and word to mortal 
praying frequently to the father of all 
men.—and to buy a fan as he was able 
to be a type of that Son who so willingly 
died that man might be served. 
As to Mr Harris’s future. 
11607 
He gives you exactly what his life 
will be. 
As to my Mental Anxieties in respect to my present 
Seer & the M. 
11608 
Bear up with your slight trials
they are as dust before the winds.

I am happy to say I have assumed at home very much 
better for my sourey. unfortunately the last 3 or 4 days 
I have sattued pearl fam— Nuctures advice I 
intended remaining at home a day of two I paid the 
greatest attention to the advice you gave me about 
I was away. Y I was indeed thankfull to you for 
your past kindness. 
11609 
Had you not have paid attention to 
those rules given to you by me your 
illness would have been of a more 
serious nature a little rest and care 
and it will soon pass away 
11610 
It is only an illness that ll mortals are 
subject to as you have no influence near 
you or about you but what is good. 
11611 
I do not see that at present when I see 
that I will warn you. 
11612 
And I shall be happy to gibe it. rest 
assured all will go well. 
How shall I disappear if the Telesm you gave me to

11615
Your System does not engine medicine 
there are other means of keeping your 
body cool. 
do you think from those from words 
you understand my meaning. 
I replied—GS for make a pondle re ask next 
Tuesday 
let it be se 
11616 
That could not be 
11617 
If your seer will have from her seal and 
you will place yourself in front of the 
mirror—your seer standing by and 
inspecting at the same time—
I placed myself in front of the M the Seer Standing at the side.—
11618 
Cross your arms over your chest. 
I did so the CA Showing the seer how it was to be done= 
11619 
left your arms up your elbows as high as your head 
I did so 
11620 
That will do 
The Seer then said I see you in the Mirror. the front 
of you seems gone—I can see your head Comings 
Abdomen & all in motion. (I do not like to see it/ 
then the CA said 
11621 
I do not see any thing sericous with your inside. I should like you 
if you can stay at home [tomorrow] 
to lay a bed tomorrow. I thank you 
132 
will then find yourself better 
11622 
I should also prefer your going 
to bed now and remain in bed till 
Thursday morning—and what you 
drink let it be a little milk, but 
Cold—and I should prefer your 
taking jelly through the day—
would form my seer with a vision 
11623 
I would willingly do so— but I am apart you getting up & down would make you wase 
and it would cause you to do so by 
writing 
My friend Lea will write for me.

Called Mr Anderson 
hes coming dancing in with his hands in his Pocket 
11675 
Here I am 
Were you at the Crystal palace saying at Aunt Sally 
11676 
no I was not. 
When calling Michael just now I was surprised at his being 
so indistinct & the difficulty I had deciphering his name 
11677 
It was on account of its being his 
first appearance to your present Seer. 
I quite forgot that 
11678 
she will see him readily Enough 
the next time calling. 
11679 
Oh and I will tell you on another 
Evening I am very curious about another 
friend of mine, but I wanted to know 
if you had tried the Seer you was 
talking about=. 
I expect them here next Tuesday 
11680 
who do you mean to call 
I am at a loss which to use 
11681 
I should not use the Crystal_[and] I should use, the 
Mirror 
do you mean Michaels Mirror 
11682 
Yes I do not mean the other.
140 
Why would you not use the Crystals 
11683 
They are small and they make the 
ladies arms tire 
he’s laughing. 
I want to call the Spirits into them as I am quite uncertain 
whether they are still attached to them or not. 
11684 
I was turning user in any soon wind how 
I could politely ask a man to week 
out his own room, but I dont know 
how to do it 
Mr. Lea who was Standing by said I soppose you wish me away 
There upon he left the room, & Mr Anderson Continues 
11685 
It is with respoect to your getting another 
Seer, I find that you could obtain a 
person, any person—if you could get the 
Consent of the other party. for them to 
inspect the Mirror for you 
—
11686 
And the party who has the power 
My Seer would doubles have no objection to any obtaining 
Another Seer. 
11687 
I do not know hardly how to express 
what I wish, I would like to say it 
to you but should like no remembrance 
of it. 
The formula 
Now you can say it 
11688 
I find it would be a benefit to the party I wish to inspect for you. 
Could you not get Mr Lea to dispose 
of her power again. 
I think not 
11689
She is very fond I know of inspecting 
the Mirror I do not know how you would gain his Consent. but I thank 
141 
if I was you I would try.—Could you 
not get your GS. when she was in 
this State. to gain her Consent. 
I understand you 
11690 
And if the other Seer could take 
her hand at the time from what it 
Can learn it would go well. 
You must rest ne her because you 
have not got your GSpirits influence 
with you. 
I will do so 
11691 
I think you had better dismiss all 
this work for the night what you have done makes a difference in the 
System. 
The few housy “Returned over” I called Lea Back not to the tone 
Train Lea’s very q new & has been much worried with 
his lawsuit. 
11692 
I think he looks better he will 
have a little more worrying yet but 
I suppose he will take his larger 
half with him somewhere. 
Lea said I am bothered with my lawsuit do you see 
what S this wife are doing 
11693 
I dont know them. 
Well I should not much worry myself 
I should take it easy

Ms Mackenzie as a Writing Medium
KM—Samuel [Lemmings?] -- Mr. Hockley is here this Evening I beg
the favor of [Coming?]

I am here.

KM Welcome Mr Hockley will ask his own questions if
you will kindly answer

With contentment I greet your friend

KM Mr. H is desirous of Speaking to you can he do so now

Certainly with pleasure to [?] him

F. H. Samuel Lemmings I thank you for your kind offer so
readily expressed -- I explained shortly the circumstances relative to my last Seeress & my doubts as to the CA
who appeared to the latter Seer [was the] being the same
who appeared to my late dear Seer.

I think that the Character of the
conversations would almost be 
sufficient evidence in such a matter
as though Spirits may take the
semblance of other Spirits at times 
yet they cannot imitate in all [points?]
but if you are in doubt after having 
done so and you will give me a few 
leading points of information I will
endeavor to discover the truth -- It is
not as easy to show all things by
the medium of writing as by seeing and 
if it is a higher Spirit than myself
I should not wish to interfere but I
will let you know if you were deceived
by a false Spirit, very high Spirits will
not always show themselves through
every medium.
145 
H/d 
I explained further any Views, also as to my belief that is 
was infamous to the health of Seer’s —So beleived of the CA sho app. 
to my late dream Seer admed me to give up & sontualism I could 
do so without a pang altho I pad Standized it so many years. 
I cannot promise you to gain any information 
from the crowned Angel himself as he would 
not I think Comsise in this wery but I will 
discover whether it was the same spirit 
I do not think that it the subject is 
Calmly carried on and with a right object 
that it is as injionous to the median as you 
think—Your first Seer would have died if she

☉die 8th April 1866. 
43 Clouderley Terrace 
20' to 8 PM. 
Miss Anna [Hardinge?] & her mama Mrs. Floyd having
favored me this Afternoon with a visit. I exhibited
to their [notices?] various books [?] [?] - Engravings
upon the occult S[?] & my mirrors & crystals. -
My "Ellesmo" Mirror I had unlocked. & drawn the curtain
on one side - in it being in its place agt. the wall then
insp' it [?] was standing about 8 or 10 feet from it
obliquely I observed that a sudden flash of flame like
lightning issued from the M -- hearing this I at once
got my CA Mirror & placed it on the Wall at
right angles with the other, requested Miss [ESS?]
to inspect it intending to invoke the C.A. but miss
[Hardinge?] whose Spiritualistic feelings appear very 
impulsive replied she could not -- it appearing to repel
her. I was somewhat vexed & [removed?] the CA M. 
when again Miss H looking into the ELLo. M should
a Second flash of light & then said there's a large book
in the mirror -- but very indistinct -- presently she sd.

There is a very beautiful Spirit above having
fair hair & long very long down. a most delicate face 
but looking rather [?] but her appearance is 
radiant & light --

Now she appears as tho floating in the air
[coming?] a lamp having 3 chains -- the flame is 
very distinct -- now theres another figure with
dark hair she also has a lamp or light like the
other -- the book is a large book -- but I cannot
make out the characters -- Miss H was then
standing close to the M -- when these appeared.

"Should you wish to continue 
your volume again -- You will surely
find the child who can interpret 
the words the angels show"

Whilst I was reflecting upon what this could 
150
[?] these came 
"shut it away from her sight she 
is not able now to continue with 
such spirits as write in your book

I closed the mirror & we sat down to the table to look
at the MSs.  Holo's crystal laying open in[t] its case
when Mr  [?] said -- theres an old man clad in
black . surrounded by radiant flames. and the
lower part of is dark dress is cast in darkness
he has a kind of mitre on his head of glossy light
he has held his hand out to me.
  
The visions disappeared & I cont'd [?] her
my wife - & [?] H. after some time observed
taking up my unconsecrated Crystal (the [?])

Here is an anchor. upside down &
a line across it & some hands trying to right the anchor
the hands are pulling away at it -- now theres the
ring & the cable passed throug it & the hands appear
as tho pulling something from the [?] -- it has fallen
down outside the C so that I cannot see it --

Now theres a cross come also upside
down [illustration of an upside down cross at an angle] and the hands are come. &
trying to put it the right way up they
have succeeded in putting the other way up only still
standing [illustration of a cross right side up at an angle] now on every side of the [rang] cross theres a
[crop] a ring and they have drawn a cable through
those rings and by that means they have put it
quite upright -- when it suddenly descended & was
buried in the Earth and immediately a large mound
appeared covered all over with [?] & [?]

I then placed the unconsecrated [M] / Mirror/ before
her - now theres the mound & the hands are come and
are tearing up large handfuls of the flowers & scattering


151

them all over the World such an immense quantity

Now there's the same cable come up with
a basket and the hands are trying to draw dew from
[water] heaven to water the [crocuses?] & their crops. but
presently the cable appeared to turn into cobwebs still
suspending the bucket -- the cobwebs broke and then
the hands took the bucket and drew water at a fountain
and a finger came out and wrote on the fountain
watch & wait -- & immediately the cobwebs became golden 
with sunbeams. they are now descending lower & lower
to the earth. now they are fading away --

 It is to me very surprising that all the 
time these visions appeared & never thought for a moment
of the Spanish Monk in his MS. indeed my mind was
so bent upon the CA & his mirror that I was rather
disappointed at Miss H persevering in looking in so these
in C instead of my CA [M] or the Japan Crystal =
However I took down my MS responses [?] XI &
commenced [reading?] the [a?] of the Spanish Monk when
it became immediately obvious to Miss H & myself 
that the man surrounded with flame was the Monk
himself = & at the conclusion of the narrative upon
my showing her the colored drawings my late dear
Seer had made of the MS. -- she [recognized?] the 
figures on the [?] as the two figures she had seen
with the lamps.

I then asked if the SM would appear
when there came (on the ceiling) "I will come again
and even with more power than ever.--" I have given 
you the watch word "Watch & Wait"

All then vanished & we closed the action = 1/4 to 10 PM
1867 At Mr. Tells, Japan & Dresser Crystal 152
Mr. Tell, Miss Emily Fill, Miss Fanny Can[?] & W. Till
they all inspected the crystals & had no visions, then Mr. 
Tells maids inspected the crystals clouded with
both but they had no visions.
I left the Japan crystal to the following 
day one of the maids inspecting it had several very
interesting visions.
Mr. Tell appeared sitting on a chair
then at a window smiling & talking to someone
outside, the girl described her dress, why different from
what Mr. T has worn for years, and that Mrs. Till
had in her ears large pair of Crystal earrings  with
large silver-mounted backs.
(These earrings Mrs. T assured me she
had not worn since her marriage in about 25 years/ nor
had any one but herself seen them)
Afterwards the girls sister, who had 
in life been very religious - but has been dead several
years appeared in the crystal - the dead who was much
older then the maid who inspected had acted as a
mother to the younger child - - under the deceased sister
there came into the (symbol for crystal)
"Remember thy Creator in the days of thy 
Youth while the evil days come not
nor the years draw nigh"
Ecclesiastes XII.1.
And then said shortly afterwards
"Blessed are the dead which die in the
Lord from henceforth"
Revelations XIV.13
This very much alarmed the girl who screamed & fainted
(next line crossed through)
This girl had serv'd other [?], but I did not see
her again as she was to leave the following week. -

153

at Mr [Pa?] -- 1867

Mrs Scott inspected the Japan C and after
22 minutes looking saw her Brother who was then in
America appeared sitting in a chair looking upwards
with his arm hanging over a Chair, just as tho sitting 
for his photograph to be taken, this lasted for more 
than a quarter of an hour.

1st June 1867            Cly Terrace

Japan Crystal

9.30 PM   M.     Chevalier

Present Dr C [Manuel?] Danes, who introduced him, Mr C
never having known or seen any thing of Crystal work 
and had just published his

M Chevalier was quite sceptical of Crystal seeing ingently 
asserting it to be the Effects of Imagination and
this he continued to do all the time altho the Crystal
veiled & clouded & became clear several times, this he
attributed to his continuous looking -- & presently after
he remarked there appeared red streaks in the C
which he said was occasioned by the long strain upon
the optic nerve & certainly he gave it a very steady 
[p?] trial in both Crystals & as he had been
looking more than half an hour very intently I
advised him to leave off rather than overstrain his
eyes --

at 10 Clock I handed the [dresser?] Crytstal and
immediately he said the Crysta appears fully dark
[green?] water rushing about now theres a fish coming
in on this side -- I see it very plain, its a gold
fish -- -- not what we usually call a gold fish but
a Species of Carp -- it is as plain as tho it was on
the Table

Dr, Danes asked if it was not his Imagination --
to which M Chevalier hastily replied Imagination
-- No -- I was not thinking about fish of any




154

kind, besides I can see the white streak on its dorsal
fin -- the fish left the C and reappeared several
times --

The C then appeared exactly like two
balls or [stem?] spheres -- for several moments

1/4 past 10  An angel appeared parting from some
creature at the bottom of the Sea as the soul is
[apresented?] parting from the body, a light female
figure -- presently Mr Ch said Now theres no
light figures (like the angel figures over the [tomb?]
on the flight into Egypt in your (Dr D's) drawing 
room)

Mr C's eyes becoming painful he put the C
down for a short time & upon again taking it up
the C clouded & Mr C said

Theres the same figure at the
bottom and from the upper part of the black 
figure theres a form like a mans, coming away
& then appears drawn back into it again -- and
every time it does so the two Angels come down
with outstretched arms to receive it -- there it has
done so five times & gone back each time -- now
its gone

Afterwards there can in a man with 
something under his arm projecting out like a
[gun?] in its cover

Upon handing Mr C Earl Stanhopes
large Crystal there appeared [?] two
large [c?]

back towards you (myself) now theres something 
its a Gentleman & Lady, they are standing by
him talking to Mr Bray, the lady has a fashionable
bonnet and cloak on. I do not know them 
I wonder who they are the Gentleman has his 
hat on the Lady is shorter than the Gentleman 
but they both appear tall people --

Upon my asking the colors of their dress she replied
they are not in colors, they appear like India
Ink drawings

I requested the Gent & Lady to turn towards the Seer
They then turned partly round & the Seer said
Mr Bray keeps holding up his [arms?] as though
arguing -- Now they have quite turned round
they appear talking very energetically -- the
Gentleman looks like Mr [Cuff?]

Mr Clarke then came round and looking
over Mrs Bray's shoulder he to my great surprise
saw the same figures -- he never having looked in
one before --

8.45     The Vision still remaining I asked
Mrs Bray if she would like to see her children
& upon her answering yes I called them in & she
said I see Harry with a hoop & stick in his right 
hand.-- I se Gertrude in a white frock & black 
jacket & hat sitting down. -- Now I see Arthur --

Mr. Preird Mr. Pacton & her daugher drenlettle elsee 
Deringion Lonston at her sister. I went to see her Y 
Took my Crystals—. Mr Sohiem being gente seepline 
upon Crystal working supposed to it even if mere, inform 
religious grumds, yet alloned one to by his daugh. 
Elen’s family for seeing. I handed him my 
ES Crystal and his father called for a friend 
of his, 
The Crystal very soon clouded & prontin 
appeared & the described it her faterh alloused consily 
as tho she had never seen it but Mr. I was so 
impatient & worried the girl so much that.—after 
about half an hour he gave it up—and we went 
to tea. 
In the forme of the Evening the ten Children came 
in to wish us good night before going to bed and 
as Mrs Pacton & Miss Alice her Sister had both been 
inspecting without any vision appearing—I suggested 
that Ellen the oldest should inspect—which she 
did but very reluctantly. 
The ES Crystal 
Immediately clouded and Ellon was 
some homes slowly coming in then one gradually 
lightened up & became very plain she saw it was 
a bakers shop.—then three appeared a very wide 
pavement & shadows flitting past which soon 
became perfect as men & women the usual sheet 
passes by. during this time the whole became 
quite distinct & Ellen saw 12 Lakes in the window 
& the passer by staying to look at them & then 
go in—She then said there is a game over the
shop & presently upon request it became plain 
Enouph for her to read—& she saw it was 
Galloway. 
160 
As none of us know a Baker of that name 
I asked her to see if she could see the name 
of the sheet & after a time she said she saw at 
the corner a white space & park sheet upon it 
one of her Arm to then said it must be the bakers 
shop at Bark Street Barkley Signame where another 
of the girls Arms resided & she thought the Bakers 
nam was Pallaway.— 
Whilst this vision was in progress 
Mrs Pacton’s daughter Alice [water] was 7 1/2 years old 
looked in at the Crystal—side ways & very delighted 
said she saw such a beautiful place in the C 
a waterfall and people Ladies & Gents walking up 
and down looking at it—and then the Crystal 
palace inside dom the Centre wish with the 
Flowers & people down the centre & then suddenly 
the palace was lighted up.—and then suddenly 
disappeared as 1/4 past 8–
As this had passed off so pleasantly 
no one being in the room but myself & the 2 aunts 
Ellen the Eldest was very desirous of inspecting 
again and thereupon I charged 
The ES Crystal 
Ellen inspected & said the Crystal was very dark 
It then got lighter & some gas lights appeared in 
front of her then she said she saw the roof 
which was very lightly appearing quite plain & the 
lights getting brighter she said with much glee 
Oh it ft I am stall—she then described 
the stage & seats & gradually the seats appeared 
to be filling—A Black man came upon the 
Stage & she said “Oh theres bones” and then 3 
Others appeared with the Triangle & Commenced 
Singing—instal they left. when 2 others 
164 
Came in & place. 9 chairs on the stage, then 
“bones” & tambourine “Came over they Channel she 
then gave us the words they said which kept 
appearing in fast as else over their heads such 
as Jamboursua said to if Bones “do your and much” 
& Bones replied “yes I read command resumes”—& she 
Chose when they sang—
Now there are 4 Singing all saying 
“Brothers so—Now the if there had put two chairs 
One at the side & one in themiddle now heres a 
man come in as yellow coat, I can let rain cont. 
& such old books his loss are pointing out he is 
setting in the chair & the other is placing the plate 
“old aunt Sally.” his books are tied on with 
string—now he’s done he has got a wig on with 
3 points of hare 
Now theres a balushade of stone and 
blue curtains—now he’s gone & the man is stopping 
now here is 3 others one has got a bag—. 
She thus went this the performance giving the songs 
& times & the words of the Shvuses. but power   
her excitement & the two laughing till they 
Cried I could not put any more to paper 
and most assuredly I win saw any me 
eijary a peep in the Crystal so heartily before 
Miss Ellen perosm at the time was “12 last Oct.

Mr Jill was at that moment up stairs in bed / and after 
a short stay gradually vanished 
7 PM Called Emma Veigh 
Now here’s a lady in a light dress holding in her 
hand a very small book—She has a light complexion 
as we could not get any dried woman. I asked if the. if the Spirit 
Present were Emma. she would hold up her hand

Will you kindly appear in the CAM, when I brink it

Walter came in dressed as usual the Seer said he was

Madame Louise Besson Speculatrix
Madam B having been impressed to visit me by a 
Spiritual friend long since deceased, arrived about 3 PM 
and in the Course of our Conversation upon Spiritualism
I took from a Cabinet-- my [?] Crystal, Earl Stanhope,
Crystal -- the Box Mirror & The Evani Glass, the latter
she having never seen, & was certainly ignorant of its 
origin and use. -- but upon taking the Evani Glass
[?] at.
7' past 4 PM Madam B said here is a beautiful 
                           -(2) the Evani Glass from its
peculiar Construction, is rather difficult to inspect. I took
out the stand & tilted it for her [?] conve[?]t is O
and at 1/2 past 4, Mad B. again inspected it. Said

about 6 inches long
May I ask the Name
      1        "Emma"
                Do love this bird, this bird will be for your
                guide--
                I heard my name spoken through your
                John and the Seer.-- I have guided
                the Seer, many weeks. I have been near
                to you.
      2        You will get by her hand a flower which 
                she has already seen.
                This flower when it is dried, you must 
                keep-- and the book you showed her
                last [and] the months manuscript. and
               after this one you will get a great many
               more. by Spiritual impression and 
                given by Spirit
                Stop for the present, in a few minutes
                I will come again. 4. 35

The reading all came over the birds head & the Wings
moved as it appeared.
Whilst we were Conversing -- these appeared 
       3         It is better to wait the Spirits are not 
                  ready yet.
Madame B then took up the oval [?] Box Mirror and 
immediately there appeared in it a request for us to  
wait until after tea..--

Madame B then informed  she had for some weeks 
been very strongly impressed to come to me, Especially
by a very dear friend in the Spiritual world who 
also often had in her hand a flower like a Camelia
I then showed Madame my Magical Manuscripts & other 
Books.
C. A Mirror                                                             3
Invoked the Crowned Angel.
I invoked, standing alone, 3 times very strongly, my
Guardian Spirit the Crowned Angel to whom the mirror
had been dedicated (        )  and in about 5 minutes
The C. A. appeared. and said 
       4         Sit down
The Mirror is Clouding-- She is here very beautiful fair
Creature fair hair bright luminous skin, blue eyes
the hair all over the shoulders. in curls, a crown round 
the head like Gold a blue dress or golden girdle
round the Waist very bright.-- [?] with Wings
I addressed the C. A. 
        5         I will answer Your questions 
will you give me leave to explain the circumstances in 
which I now feel myself placed. and  the manner in 
which my last Seeress has acted towards me.
       6        I will 
May I ask your Name
      7           You have just wrote it down in Your book
                  You have traced it a few minutes since
Now there are 3 other spirits one with dark hair or
[?] beautiful hand very tall small waist she
Say I
       8          I was doubtful before indeed of the 
                   spirit world, I am now happy to 
                   see before me the bright light and 
                   my progress has  so rapidly come
                   to me with the help of the dear 
                    Crowned Angel
Now they are all talking together. - one of them is a
Younger Spirit not very tall with fair hair under
her has come
          9           For along time I have worked to speak
                       to you about your last Seer. Who used
                       to look in this mirror -- let me
4
                     beg of you never to let her look again
                     in this mirror, and for yourself it is
                     much better that you should leave off
                     the thoughts of speaking to her_rather
                     think yourself too highly elevated
                     by respect to your bright soul and
                     the CA will give you the same advice
Yonder the spirit with the dark hair then appears
       10           "Sarah"
                      The Crowned Angel[s] asks you to promise
                      to the CA that you will never have 
                      anything to do with Mr. Lea, if you
                      wish to keep the CA for a Guardian
                      Spirit you must this moment promise
                      Never to Speak any word. 
                      You will say so
I explained at great length the infamous manner in
which I had been heated by my friend Lea after
25 years acquaintance -- his meanness & the [?]ly
duplicity of his woman and that I was determined 
to tell him my mind upon the subject
        11          No use upon when you see him, look
                     at him as a friend again, touch his
                     hand and say to him
                            Oh Lea are you not so [?]
                     then laugh and he will be vexed &
                     finally he will feel in his heart
                     a great repentance & sorrow for what
                     he has done.  and he will come to 
                     you before long and beg you to forgive
                     him, - You will rise then and be
                     revenged.
I expressed my dislike at letting him & his woman
off so easily.
      12.          Now my friend & hither take any
5
                        advice and when you come to meet 
                        in the spiritual world you will see 
                        the progress of your kindness, and
                        you will see the one who offended you
                        kneel down and pray for you to forgive
                        him spirit & soul and help him to
                        rise.
                        You will do so for me.
I explained at length the sincere gratitude I felt for 
the many past favors & kindnesses I had received at
the CA's hands. & that nothing but that could induce
one to act in a manner so contrary to my feelings.
        13            The CA does not ask from you any
                         recompense, only to take his advice.
I hea[?]ly explained that it was only to meet the CA's wishes
that I could consent to do so after the manner in which 
I had been heated.
        14             The one who offended you will be
                         punished - not from me, but by the
                         power of God.
                         God will avenge you, at the time 
                         you least expect it.
My Seer [?] and I never saw any thing so bright & beautiful
as these 4 spirits appear
I then said I would do as the CA wished
          15             Now you will receive for this the love
                           and the great power of God.
                           Three words more
          16             You must often call me I will give
                           the power to Louise to see and to
                           speak plainer, this power is new
                           to her, she will be passive, have 
                           great success & make rapid progress
6
                     She will succeed with drawings. She
                     must draw with the pencil for a few
                     weeks.            and off the mirrors She
                     will describe tableaux, alone in the 
                     room by you two, and drawing the
                     figine, only she must be quiet & rest.

                    May to Heaven & God your father to 
                    raise your Soul bright and happy
                    and to give back to my friend the
                    great pleasure which he used to have
                    some time ago.
   
                    If you have something to say [t] do so.
The CA has sat down.
I then mentioned the many doubts I had had about
the CA's identity - that another CA had once tried
most pertinaciously to deceive me - the impossibility
of my knowing Even now that the one present was the
one who had gave me the info. & to whom this [in] was
dedicated but trusting in the presence of our Lord
J.C. I would believe that I should not be deceived
       17            That is right. Pray to Jesus Christ
                       he will give you the Assurance and
                       the Strong belief - I am your guide 
                       and I will preserve this mirror from
                       all evil Spirits
        18           Tell Louise before she looks she must 
                        place her Soul in the hands of the great
                        Merciful God. and ask of him the 
                        [?]ate power for her to see clear & well
                        You will after a little while become
                        happy & give thanks to me for the 
                        impression I give to this maternal body
                        to Come to you
7
       19           The second time you will look you 
                      will receive a flower. Take great care
                      of this flower. When it is day keep
                      it in the book, the Manuscript which
                      I shall direct to you, and give two
                      leaves to your Seer.
                      Now remember.
                      I will leave. Farewell. I desire your 
                      happiness - think of me I am always 
                      near you and direct you so much
                      as my power permits me.
As my Evenings are often so lonely & dull may I try
If I can write by spiritual guidance under your
care & permission
        20             You may
                          Wait a few weeks and I will direct you

the bottle.
          43       O yes I do
do you remember where I used to live
          44      you lived near ----------
After some further responses which appeared very
Equivocating I said I would call him another 
time
         45       well thats a good fellow
Where are you now
         46       well I am in the third Sphere.
What are you dead

I will not say any more to you tonight

                       The Vision
Now theres a young person in white in the left hand
she holds a rose in the right hand a camelia
on her head a crown of strange blossoms now 
she's talking to an old Lady now the clouds have
come across and hid them

       Now theres a Garden. full of beautiful friends
Oh so high with flowers & vegetables of the Spiritual
World - and grapes - I feel the taste of them
in my mouth - it is very sour to me. I see these
grapes are hanging from a vine - tree - now there are
many angels - I see beautiful faces heavy & under
neath the grape leaves - Oh many a great many
and far away from this garden I see a house
A summer house - there's a group of spirits. I hear 
the music - its splended music & light & beautiful
there are spirits dancing - Now theres a brighter spirit 
[?]ing - they are all in spirit robes, they are so bright
I cannot look at them. They look so far off
[blank top half of page]
I could not catch the words of the other line,
14
A mile at least away, and between the spirits & the
[and below] there passes large flaming colored clouds,
of every color and on one cloud I see a thing like
a babys cot - so large & supported by 4 angels
they are full of little Cherubs - Angel heads with
wings - the 4 angels are dressed one in blue, green
purple - and golden dresses. Now they remain
still so that I can examine them - In the cradle
they look to heaven. & beg me to pray - (This came
thru the seers interior mind & heart. & she had
never felt so before
           59        "Pray for the progress of the power
                        you possess, and ask of God to
                        send to you a fine spirit to guide
                        your sight in the mirror for the
                        good of your brothers & sisters
                        to teach the truth to those that do
                        not know. -
Between this a bright light has passed as tho' on fire
between the light one is many stars. Each star is 
a head. and each head is an angel. the cradle
now seems to fall down. & leave a lot of little Cupids
flying - Now a Superior Spirit has come in
with a Small Cupid at the top of a long bright
stick. - and this Superior Spirit is calling all
the others round him - They look no bigger than
butterflies. They are so far away - Yet they are
perfectly distinct.
              60      Round the bright spirit[s] the little 
                                                     spirits fly
[dotted line referring to the note on the opposite page]
Now theres a large group of spirits come - ah here,
the CA is in the middle so bright yet they look
many miles away. They are all standing & talking 
together. and point towards the light. It is so 
light my Eyes can hardly be [?] if they were
closer I could not see at all.
They are all gone.

The C.A. is here alone & says 
        61     I am here and will answer what you
                 ask of me, and if I am able will
                 give you advice for your good.
May I ask you to tell me then & on what evenings I shall request
your presence in the mirror -
        62       I will
                    rest a few minutes I will come back
                    directly.
7' to 9
The CA is gone, I can see myself.
Now behind my head there appears a yellow cloud & 
now a blue cloud covers my head and I no longer
see myself.
Now these two spirits come in. They have placed them
selves one on Each Side - 
           63         We are to stay here to keep away Evil
Now theres a beautiful veil come in front of me like
a dress.
     The C.A. is here
           64          I am ready to answer.
On which evening had I best invoke
           65          Tuesdays and Fridays
At what hour
           66          1/2 past 7 if that does not suit you
                          Eight - two hours or two hours to half.
                          I will give the power, & the hand and to
                         the [?] to see.
I thank you for your kindness, I will with your
permission avail myself of your permission
          67          Welcome I shall be always happy
                         to meet you both.
Shall I then be able to receive the [?] book to complete
the sit you gave me thru my late dear Seer.
          68           No you will come again
I meant at some future sitting
          69            Yes. 
[*16*]
    70      For days the Seer must thoroly develop
               this power with great care & sincerity &
               after weeks I will look and make 
               her ready, prepare yourself for that.
I thank you. - I will endeavor to do so
     71       I am not gone yet.
The CA's talking to Some one on the left.
Heres a Spirit come in and said
    72         Sarah
Can it be possible that you are my late dear wife
    73         I am., and pleased am I to say
                 that I am bright and happy. but            
                 Sorry to see your brain so much
                 affected. Your Study on these subjects 
                 will distract you = You will get
                 enough on the two [days] evenings of the week
                 for to occupy your mind on the other 
                 days 
                        Now receive my best love, and
                 I go to my Father to look for you
                 in the future a home in the bright
                 land., there to meet forever, farewell
                 I will come another day to give you 
                 some other description that will
                 satisfy you.
Accept. &c.

She has gone. and the C.A's come again
5' past 9.
My dear C.A., my late dear wife has appeared &c.
        75       I sent her to you. I knew it would
                   give you satisfaction & pleasure
                   Leave the past, and think of the future
                   What she did when she was alive she 
                   has paid for now. She is happy
                   and bright --

The Sacrament
              Unfortunately from the Seers imperfect
knowledge of our Language -- the CA's responses
are very imperfectly rendered in these passages
tho the Seers English when repeating the responses are
[?] in advance of her usual Conversation.
I [?] [?]  to return to this subject again
17
May I ask you a question on a Subject that much concerns
me.
       76       Welcome
This being Sacrament Sunday at the Chapel to which
I have attached myself - (Independent) the minister
naturally presses exceedingly upon his Congregation the
necessity of their taking the Sacrament for many
reasons. I have never done so. May I ask &c.
       77       do not allow yourself to do this --
                  The Sacrament is to love God and to 
                  pray to him, and not to pray to man
                 God will give you the Sacrament for
                 the progress of your Soul. and the
                 Sufferings you must bear. pensively
                 & penitently put your Soul into  
                 the hands of the Great power. and 
                 beg, God's will be done, that is the
                Sacrament.
As to my unfitness &c.
        78     It is for this I gave you that advice
                  The one who cannot receive the
                  Communion with a pure Soul and
                  a pure heart., had better not go.
                  to blaspheme so great a power.
                  and as Jesus Christ says to you
                  "Remember me" for your Soul & your
                  heart. You do not feel called to 
                  drink my blood and Eat my 
                  head. -  It is much better to
                  stay away & pray by yourself.
                         Pray to my Father to forgive
                   what you have done wrong and to
                   give you the power to act better
                   for the future -- and pray for yourself
                   alone.
                   x x x x  x x [?]
                   Now my friend pray for yourself.
                   before you go to bed and when you get
                   up in the morning -- trust yourself to me
                  Your Spirit guide. & I will do my best to 
                  direct you
18
  79     God will see in the bottom of your
            heart and Soul if you love him truly
            He will love you too. now think of
            him & pray.
            Call me to your help. I am always
            near you and welcome.
From the imperfect knowledge of the English language
possessed by the Seer, I have received your kind
replies but imperfectly & have been obliged to omit
some portions may I ask your assistance when copying
it out
       80    You Will get the power for it
I regret to say my head is very much oppressed
this Evening.
      81     You must take some Exercise, go out
                more in the open air. do not say
               so much inside the room.
               You will feel better by & bye.
As to the perplexity I am in about -- and the
CAs sylogism - & if by willpower I can expell
        82      Some evil around you you cannot
                  see. - You will not suffer long.  You
                  must get some incense that is burnt
                  in Catholic Churches, the Seer will
                  buy it for you.-
Will you tell my Seer how to use it
         83     I will impress her.
                   patience you will not Suffer long
Thank you
         84     Welcome.
I regret having to make our Evening upon a Subject
which appears in itself so [?]. Yet has been
such a Severe Source of annoyance to me
          85      Nothing is Extraordinary to me
                     ask me any thing that belongs
                     to the Spirit power and I will advise
                    you and do what I can.
19
Do you remember giving me the Palingenesia
Spell for plants & other things.
        86       Yes
Altho I have never practiced it - I have felt a very
great Satisfaction in my mind in knowing the formula
       87        I do not wish you to do it.
May I at a future time solicit some other formula
for the encreasing my Spiritual knowledge
      88.          You may
I ask to know if with your Consent I shall have
the flower given to me
     89           Yes.
                    You will get it when you do not expect it
 Will it be here or at my Seers
     90           I can say no more.
As to --
     91           She is bright but not bright enough
                     to come yet.
As to my past life
      92           You are right so far this was your
                      mission only hope for a happy day
                       be faithful in Jesus Christ and
                       God the Father.
In future I will endeavor to get my Questions ready
& written out
      93           Do so if you like it better
As to my Seers improvement.
     94           before long she will make much
                     more progress
The CA is in a white dress gold girdle & Crown
wings, fair light hair she looks so bright and 
beautiful yet I cannot say whether man or
woman, the eyes open & very blue, her dress all
one. (white) She says
      95          All my wish is for the purification of your
                   Soul for heaven, my desire is for
                   your progress.
I returned thanks.
Mr. Randolphs Crystal is precisely the size of my Japan Crystal &
quite equal to it in color & beauty.-- but has a small clear [?]
on the outside.  it is kept in a square black leather case lined
with black velvet – 4 inches long & 3 inches square at the top
& bottom with two hoops & a spring fastening at the top.

            when shut [drawing of the closed box]

When the case is opened the sides fall back and the
crystal stands on a small hole perforated in a square
piece of wood covered with black velvet under which is a 
small black locket or stand black with gilt flowers
round it __ & red underneath

12' to 9.     Dr Randolphs Crystal
My Seer Louise took Dr R's Crystal & inspected it and
immediately said
        Here is a star in the Crystal here is a 
naked woman with a child in each arm_ near me
has left the arm & is walking at the side, now the
others down. and are all 3 walking, they appeared
to go down at once (not put down) Now theres a 
Angel bouquet with a large blue flower, a large
red tulip and two yellow tulips -- on the side the 
naked woman carries it in the middle of the
Crystal -- She is quite alone -- now there appears
a high pyramid and she kneels down. and
prays, on the left side of the pyramid is two blue
flames -- each flame is a man and he appears 
to throw out a blue flame from his fingers, he 
has thrown it on the womans head. and she 
looks and kneels down and prays to him and
to point up to Heaven. She cries So much. The
Men and the woman are now gone.
          Now I see a large mountain and
the reflection of the Sun appears to go up and
down. -- its all gone

CA mirror.      Harpon St.
Invoked the CA
7h 30' PM
5' Its clouding
       101        Sit down.
Now the CA appeared surrounded with beautiful
golden light & splendid blue clouds.
       102         I am ready to your call.
May I ask if with your permission I endeavor
to become a writing medium shall I succeed
      103         Yes if you try
                      Every morning I told you before when
                     you awake. Ask of God the power
                     and to send you a spirit that can
                     sympathize well with you and 
                     then you may succeed after a few
                     days, may be a few weeks.
Shall I use a common lead pencil
       104        Yes and common paper to begin 
                      with
I will have a book made & it will be nine [?]
       105        Yes and you may write at first
                      something you cannot read.
I presume I must lay on my back
23
      106     Yes you may begin so.
My Seer Louise has commenced Spirit drawing & I hope
She will succeed
      107      Yes
She has also commenced Writing, some of which I
have here in my hand but it is quite unintelligible
      108      That is to control the hand & teach
                   the nerve to be passive
                   You will receive by drawings some very
                   wonderful things through the hand.
                   of the Seer Louise She will progress
                   rapidly.
I related my Seers Spirit manifestat'n that occurred to her—
     109        Yes it is right
                    last night — she got her Soul free
                    from the body and under a developing
                    Spirit of high Sphere. She will feel
                    that for a week or so Every night
                    and see Every night at the same
                    time the same figure for her good
                    She must be quiet and passive
                    and Steady, she has got a very strong
                     power given to her under GODs protection
10' to 8 Now the C.As vanished
The CA's here again.
      110                I have not gone for long.
Mr Mackenzie for sometime received Communications. Thro
his mother as a writing Medium from a Spirit who
described himself as Samuel Jennings, a deceased
Clergyman of the Church of England some of his
Communications were interesting — but none of a high order
      111                 That depended upon the Sphere
                             that he belonged to, if it was not a 
                             bright sphere he could not give
  ,conversation,   the language of an elevated [?d]
                             he may be progressing by going about
                             in the Spiritual World.
                             Mackenzie himself has got a rather
24
               Evil influence by the weak mind
               he has got. and this brings to his
               mother a weak power, she will
               progress soon.
I think they have discontinued Spiritualism
    112      Not all
The letters on the [?] JC
    113      Not to night when she is permitted
                I will come in the same dress. and
                the same robe and let her see.
I thank you
    114       Welcome.
I will wait with patience and doubt not being
able to develope her sight
    115        do you not see she is quite near on
                  the Subject She will in two weeks
                  she will be able to see brighter 
                  manifestations.
                  I will show something to night
I will procure some glasses such as you directed me
to get for my prior seer Emma.
    116        Yes it will her Sight & enable her to see
                   better. and you must keep the place
                   as dark as you can. the darker it is
                  the better the seer is able to see
It is my intention with your permission to call you in
this mirror alone on Tuesdays, and on Fridays to
Call Spirits in my other mirrors & crystals.
     117        Call me in this mirror on every Tuesday
                   Evening --
                   one Tuesday you must invoke in the Crystal
                   and [strikethrough and] one other Friday in the
                   other [strikethrough crystal] mirror
My Japan Crystal was dedicated to Louise and
afterwards to ADA who took charge of it. but I
do not know whether Ada has directed it or not
       118        You will know when the Seer looks
                      that is not my work. but I will
                     give you advice  If the Spirit cannot
25
            influence the Seer by the look of the
            Spirit I would advise you to send away
            the Spirit if he is one that does not
            suit the [strikethrough spirit] Seer.
Of Course if this you wish I would call you only on
Tuesdays and Fridays
   119     I cannot come Every day -- I may
              visit you every day. I have got a 
              great many to do good for in the
              Spiritual World when I am able to
              come on the Tuesday and the Friday
              I will let you know.
As to pub'g my book
   120     Very well it will do you good and do 
               good to others.
May I ask if you remember S.O.M. and Ellesmo
Ellesmo gave me two very excellent discourses
    121       I do he will give you some again
                 by & bye.
I shall indeed be delighted to receive them.
   122        Everything will come in Time with
                 patience.
                  Now I will
On my Former birthdays you used to Congratulate
me. for the Ensuing year and my last [strikethrough] birth
days. I much grieved to lose the opportunity 
     123     You have it the same.
                 You must wait with patience. The
                 next you will receive two birthdays
                 as a recompense for the one you
                 lost.
After I called you on [strikethrough Tues][Sun symbol]day Ev'g the Seer inspected
the Box M[agic] M[irror] and a Spirit appeared who called
herself a friend of my mothers and said my mother
wished to Come.
   124          It is not right one mirror on Each
                   Evening is sufficient so long as
                   the Seer is not quite developed
26
As to my mothers appearing & her extreme unkindness to
me when I was a Child & my having no affection for her
    125       Well if so you must forget the
                  unkindness of your mother. When you
                 were a child and only think of the
                 progression of her Soul in Heaven and
                 pray for her, and she will be able to
                 Come to you to beg you to forget her
                 hardness towards you, remember you
                 belong to her blood & flesh. her Soul 
                 and body, for this you must love 
                 her & be pleased to receive her when 
                 she does come. -- Receive her well and 
                be happy to meet her by & bye for
                all eternity
                        Take my advice   I will guide
                her near you   when She has got
                permission of our Father to come & tell
                you something for herself   I cannot
                tell you the day nor the week.  I 
                know she will come  it may be sooner
               than I expected.
On the 22nd of Sept.r next my mother will have been
dead 40 years.  I was in hopes that in that time Spirits
attained too high a state to be able to appear in
our Mirrors & Crystals.
      126     Yes my friend the Spirit must
                  progress in the Spirit World like a 
                  Child growing up in this She must
                  pass thro a great many Spheres before
                  She is in the right one
                 That is all I can tell you
May I ask you a question
      127       Oh yes you may ask 
You say many Spheres, how many are there
      128        Fifty Seven.
Can you give or show my Seer a diagram of the Spirit
Spheres that my Seer may Copy
27
    129         Yes one Evening or She may get it by 
                    drawing
I hope my Seer may be able to [perceive?] the incense
    130.         She will
When I use it I shall do it with a Strong will &c.
   131            That is right
My Seer is very Anxious about her divining.  the
Spirits seem to be gradually developing her power
I hope they will succeed
   132         Yes she will if she takes time & hears the
                   writing passively & with perseverance
                    She will succeed and rapidly    I told
                   you so before
My Seer had a person Call upon her about a matter
of importance to her.  Can you tell if it will be
favorable to her
     133         I will Examine the person and the
                    second day tell her
                    Look next Tuesday and I will tell
                    her.
                    Tell her She must not worry herself
                    the troubles [?] a bright life
                    will come before her now, She must
                    believe in the Spirit [strikethrough world] that 
                    guides her  it has great power and 
                    will guide her for the best. 
Now the CAs rising
Will you favor us with the Vision
      134        I will in five minutes
The CAs gone up over the Seal.
26' past 8 PM
                      The Vision
The Clouds begin on the right hand of the mirror
is a cloud of blue and gold in the middle pink
and blue on the left side a dark & smoky Yellow
Now in the mirror comes a beautiful Garden
with stones like Gold & diamonds on the Ground
28
there are beautiful flowers and a great many spirits
are flying about over the flowers & smell at them like
Birds.
                   Now theres a house come with a dome
on each side of the dome there appears a lovely face
& theres a cross on the top like a diamond -- now
theres a procession.  One Spirit very tall comes first
the others walk after him.    they are so bright & look so 
lovely.  Some are dressed in blue, some in purple, white
Gold & Silver dresses    each one has a flower in her hand
blue, pink, yellow, dark blue, light blue, mauve.
Every color.   Now I see in the sky pink blue and 
very light white clouds. Now theres a very broad
place where they stop -- the ground like gold, they
are praying and looking to heaven.
     135      Each one has a mission. __ __ __ __ __ __
                  Each creative life to guide Each
                 person alone __ __ __ __ __    __   __ ___ __ __
                 then part  & say farewell __ __ __ __ __
                 that will meet again
Now they point to a large purple flower
     136      This flower is the point where we
                  may meet again.
Now the flower changed to [strikethrough] a spirit, on Each side
theres two little angels in blue dresses, wings fair
hair round face, bright color in the cheeks, smiling
up so sweetly to heaven they go into the sky and
take away the spirit that was the flower -- now 
I hear music. The sky opens and theres a great
many spirits come forth.  They say
    137          Welcome to the Group.
The spirit that was the flower is joining in.  I can
see only his foot and that is such a beautiful pink
the sky has shut up altogether.
               Now there are 2 more spirits coming
but they cannot go after the others -- now between
the spirits and the sky is a large mountain there
spirits are trying to reach the top of the mountain
Now there is a cloud coming in the middle of the
29
mountain & making an opening in the mountain
the Spirit looks so dull  he is working on the side of the
mountain, his tears fall -- he's praying
    138       I pray God to leave the way free
Now theres a little Angel come down with a scroll of 
paper    on the paper is
    139       Pray earnestly & longer for progress &
                  you will rise one day when your work
                  is accomplished -- This is your mission
                 come down to your Sphere & there stay
                  in Comfort [?] till this bright sky
                 opens again and I will come for you
The two spirits are brother & sister born on the same day
and died on the same day., and have the same mission
to bear and the same work to do
    140         Now two little bright spirits have come
down and brought some fruit longer than pears, they
are pink and yellow. One has this fruit & the other some 
large grapes, the angels say
    141          Eat these, our father sent to you
                    some other sort of Fruit that will be
                    more suitable to your Sphere.
                   Lay quiet and rest for the rest of the
                    night. Farewell __ when the night has
                    passed and the day begins to rise
                    I will come again in two days. good
                    by I go.
1/3 to 9    its all gone
Now heres something coming  it is 5 children in short
wings dressed in white and blue, and guided by a
very fair Spirit fair hair dressed in blue, Here is a
paper come.
      142          I come to you to let you see all your 
                      children watching you, and come 
                      to your sphere, for my Father gave
                      to me the permission to guide your
                      children and the wife who is with me
                      only say ___ __ __ __ my children are all
30
[strikethrough]    in the same sphere
The Seer remarked I know this spirit  he has appeared to
me before in a Vision
        143               Dear mother thank the guide whom
                              you see and thank God for the power
                            which you have got, love God. Love
                            your children -- You will receive every
                           week more & more. Oh mother my
                            love is for you the same as though you
                           brought me, many times    I play near
                           you and you do not know it. before 
                           long you will see your children fly
                           like a bird. Every step every thought
                          comes to me mother. I will pray for
                          you and prepare for you a home for
                          your soul to part no more.
They look such pretty innocent creatures
       144             Never grieve any more, if you have
                           not got any children now, God knows
                           the best
Now the children dance all together round the tall
spirit they are so bright and happy, they are gone
Heres a spirit come dressed in purple & said

other Evening
    160     He will and will tell you the cause
               why Evil came, some look into it who
               are not fit for so great a sight, who
               were not serious upon the subject, only
                played and joked, and for this
                Evil took possession, it is against those
                that the Crowned Angel gave you that
                advice, to use each mirror one
                Evening and so for your Crystals, to
                bring back again the influence belong'g
                to each object you may have trouble
                to regain the influence for a few
                evenings or even weeks. this is why
                I tell you to leave it here. for here the
                spirits manifest themselves through
                the medium and he will act and
                purify the mirror
I thank you for your advice
    161      You are welcome    I shall be happy if 
                 its useful to you.
I will leave as indeed I had intended   this M[agic] M[irror] and my
Seer Louise can look in it what she pleases
    162      That is right
                 Any thing I can do for you I will
                 do with pleasure and shall be happy
                 to give you good advice
                 Yes you must work a few weeks with
                 this to give the purification  -- You know
                 if the Earth is not worked the vegetables
                 cannot grow.
                 If your mirror is not looked into in
                 a proper manner and proper persons
                 for it -- it is spoiled and is not good
                 for any thing
                 The Guardian of this M[agic] M[irror] sent me to
                 give you advice today -- he is engaged
33
                 in a private mission and is [?ed]
                 to a brighter sphere -- You will see
                 him the second time -- myself and the
                 Guardian and 5 Spirit Angels and
                  other Spirits will Come to
I thank you  we shall be glad to see him once again
     163       You will see him more than once
                  I hope.
May I ask if we can see my old friend Mr Anderson
as we call him.
      164       No let the mirror come into its right
                    state after this you may receive what
                     you desire.
       165        thats right.
There are so many discrepancies in the description given
of the spiritual world -- the states of being -- or the
spheres -- it would be very desirable if we could arrive
at the truth
        166        Never,  no man alive will know it --
                       It is not permitted -- It is through
                       this many men believe the spirits
                       break down --
                       men want to know too much.
                       It is impossible for any human
                       being to know every secret under
                       heaven's power. No one will know
                        this -- and even when a man or woman
                        dies they are many years before they
                        know the definitive to the power of
                       the creator 
                                    Man must die in a very pure 
                        state, his spirit must be bright &
                        elevated when he leaves the body
                        then he may see all at once his frontier
                        and See the future
                                     It is for this no man must
                        ask too much on some points when
34
                when the spirit says he cannot tell
                him any more, and you say to
                him in the name of God. I require
                a true teacher and true lesson and
                receive by your teaching the  truth.
The Clouds all round the Spirit are very beautiful
blue, pink & golden.
      167      You may get it but be not in too great
                   a hurry.

                   You will get some book by dreaming thru'
                   the present Seer bodily of Spirits of
                 Every soul and shape, many Spirit
                  change their shapes when it likes,
                  for this you must study how to gain
                 again the time you have lost.
        
                 Sometimes it is to break an illusion of 
                 the mind --
                  Sometimes you think a spirit deceives
                  you when he does not, he sees better
                  than yourself --
                  I would not say every spirit is prime
                  A great many are evil and ignorant
 
                 Some spirits just deceased like to go
                 on an think they are to progress all
                 alone, and they go back through
                 their ignorance and inferiority.
Some years since I was one evening Engaged with this M[agic] M[irror]
when a spirit avowedly evil came in & on certain
conditions offered to leave me a diamond in the water
vessel. I sometimes used to invoke spirits in.
       168        You may see a picture but not 
                       a diamond, this is not permitted
                        to any spirit.
                       Take my advice & never call any spirit
                         that offers you that.
35
I refused to have any thing to do with him, out of
respect & regard to my G S the Crowned Angel
     169        That was right
There are many different orders of spirits, as spirits of
the spheres -- planetary spirits & others
     170        to be sure
May I ask of what order of spirits you belong
     171         Oh yes
                    I belong to Jupiter
May I ask who is the Chef ruling  Spirit on [Jupiter symbol]
     172         S E
My Seer heard the name & repeated it -- it sounded like
Sevomt but upon asking for the name to appear we
could only get two letters S.E.
     173        That's right -- no more.
                   If I was not good I should not be
                   permitted to come.   The Seer is guided
                   by a Spirit higher than my sphere
                   and for this I cannot come, and not
                   be truthful.
                         The impression she received and has got
                   the power to hear the spirits talk mentally
                   and all at once see, hear & feel his body
                           This a gift from God. She must
                  transmit what she receives properly
                  She is only the subject to give you what
                  she receives, she does not know how 
                  that comes. She is like a machine
                  which any mechanic can work.
                        She is sensitive and impressable
                   and likes God herself.
                          It is not very great and you will
                    get better soon.
                          I am always pleased to impart
                     my Spirit Knowledge and therefore
                     that you __ __ __ __ __ __
We will wait patiently for the Seers further development
       174         Thats right -- you know what the
                       Spirit told you and never break
36
                    the Spirits commands, when the Spirit
                    gives you advice keep it and never
                    break it, it is for your good.
                            I will soon show you a Sphere
                    and that will close---
I returned thanks etc
        175      I will show you a low sphere in the
                    Heavens, at least in the planets.
21' to 9.  Whilst we were waiting & the Seer looking in the M[agic] M[irror]
She suddenly started and exclaimed, Oh dear its all
dark what is that
        176         Do not be afraid Louise be strong 
                       [?] -- you are not alone   each 
                       side of you is an angel, one of
                       your children watches your head
                       and your brain.

The Vision
Now I see a place like a large broad field, I see a
human figure   it looks so miserable, as tho' begging
the face looks so sad and distressed -- now there is a
number of them men & women    Some look merry.
Some devout and one praying, some look haughty
and proud, some are dressed like princes, priests,
clergymen lawyers and gentlemen       Some are ladies
and Nuns  & Some very bad. Some pray  Some look
very lively and witty, and some tipsy, ragged, oh so
dirty without boots, filthy no shirts on. wretched
creatures worse than the beggars on the street all
in the same place alike
       177         Another time I will show another
                      Sphere, where they begin to progress
                      This is for your understanding how 
                      those who are kings in your life
                      may be very miserable in Spirit life
                              You see a great many spirits
                      who for a number of years have been
                      in the Spirit world and are not
                      progressing yet. Kept down by their
                      ignorant pride

37
                 Who still keep to their Evil proud
                 life some of those have been here 200
                  years and some a great many more
                  Now they feel so wretched, they
                  dont know the way to progress yet
Now here is one of those very dirty wretched men, he
does not know the way, but he begins to brighten
his cloathes become cleaner & brighter, his face a little
cleaner, his hair tidier  he seems to go alone to a
small corner. he kneels & prays & says
      178            O Lord break down this foolish
                     pride in my heart & cleanse my soul
                        O Father call me up give unto
                     me a better place I feel wretched & 
                     miserable I will progress.
                       O Lord send me an elevated
                    guide to teach me to Love the truthful
                    and to purify my soul after so many 
                    years of suffering     I begin to see it is
                   very wrong of me not to progress, I 
                   had every opportunity by the visits &
                  the teachings of those bright elevated
                  Spirits Oh Lord on this Evil Sphere
                       Oh call me higher up I feel my
                  body burn & my soul is wearied but
                  oh I cannot forget what I have done
                  to my brothers & sisters, I would live
                  again for to suffer myself, what I
                  allowed to be done to & suffered by those
                  below me --
                       I see now the truth. I see the
                  proud heart it cannot succeed and
                  the soul cannot progress, thru its great
                 imperfection it cannot come to the 
                 heart of its Creator.
                       Oh Father of the Whole of Every
                 Creature you love all your children
                 and I did not love you enough. I did
                 not trust in your great power, but
38
                     but laughed & derided thy Name
                     Oh call, Call my soul to your
                     place & make me free from this Evil
                     Sphere.
Now I see a bright Spirit come down to the head of the
penitent & place his bright feet on his head. they are
so beautiful & pink and his beautiful wings [strikethrough & his] go
round his arms    they go up & in a second the sky
opens & theres these birds.
         179       Come again
The Spirit says to the penitent
        180       Your prayer was heard by our father
                      he sees [?] the bottom of your
                      heart true repentance he sees your
                      wish for truth & he has turned your
                      Sphere to a bright one.
Now the angel & the penitent is on the Second Sphere
         181       The Second Sphere is [?] [?] leave
                      all for a Second Night. for this one
                      Spirit, now look and examine well
                      this Sphere. and see the wretched creatures
                      that wickedness and a bad life draws
                      him too. The next evening you will see
                      the same Sphere & the Second Sphere
They all look so wretched & miserable all the fair people
are gone, they come & go -- heres one comes who looks
as if he he did not know what to make of himself  he
feels his head, his hands, his body & puts his hands
up and down his legs, he cant tell whether he is
dead or alive, Some of the others speak to him but
he cannot answer. He thinks to himself. he is in 
Hell. and that he sees the devil all the [?]. ---
Now theres a brighter one gone to him and said to him
        182           This is not Hell but only a low Sphere 
                         and if you try you will leave this get
                         better.
he does not understand it but tosses up his head. He
39
wants to see God all alone, one of them has said
      183               You must wait     the time     Your time
                            is not come yet
Now he calls his wife and children & one of the others says
      184               You may call a hundred times before
                            they will come, You have seen
                            nothing yet do not be foolish, sit 
                            down on the ground.
he replies
      185                 I cannot Sit down      I cannot rest in
                             your place I see my body all the
                             time -- 
the other says    Well of course you do
he replies ----
      186                 I see my body very black, oh very
                             black of course if my bodys black
                             my soul is not white
                             I dont like you, you dont suit me
the other says     Ah. I suppose you want too much
        187               You want to progress all at once
he replies             I do not, I don't know that I am in
        188               the progression place, I don't know
                             any thing about it, only I see
                             my wife cry and my children crying
                             after me, and that worrys me a great
                             deal. -- I wish I could go and leave
                             off this old coat, I wish I could go
Now hes trying to go to his body & he cannot. he says
        189              Theres no hole to go out at again
                             Oh - I see the worms near the body
                            I feel it touch me. Its eating me
                            Oh what a bad position
Now theres a very tall man come from the others & said to 
him,
        190              Come along & leave this thought, come
40
                     with me and I will give you a better impression
Now theres a small bright round and the tall spirit says
    191            look up this hill, & try to reach to top
                     when you are there you will feel better
the fair creature replies
    192          Well
the tall spirit says
    193         When you are there call me
the man replies
    194         how can I call you I dont know your
                   name
the tall spirit says
     195         Call me the Guide to the unfortunate
                    and there I will be near you.
Now the fair man walks along quick hes reached the top
There he is standing still, and he calls & prays -- the
tall spirits' gone to him & said
      196        I am here what do you want
the other says
      197        You told me to call you when I had got
                    to the top.
The tall spirit says 
      198        look to this side and there is your
                    Sphere.
                    Its the 3rd Sphere, the 3rd Sphere up.
Now its all cleared and gone.

I thank you very sincerely for the interesting Vision you
have shown to my Seer. Shall I call you again in
this mirror next Friday
       199        You have other mirrors & crystals
                     You must work their influence first
I replied as to the mirror being protected
       200         Certainly, and watch yourself too
                       a good influence, and a good guide
                       is always necessary for the soul
I returned thanks
5' past 9 PM
41
[Mars sign] die 15 April 1862           H St.
C[rowned] A[ngel] Mirror
17' to 8 PM    Invoked the C.A.
      201           Sit down
I exorcised three times. -- The CA appeared as beforeeared to hear a longer
name given
          204           No
May I ask why their names were not given
         205            No necessity
What do you mean by that, Am I not to ask their names
         206          You may not ask that question
                          It is not necessary.
                           It was only a friend sent by the Guardian
                           of the mirror
My former Seer dear Emma used to see the names in
the Mirror at full length, but this Seer appears to hear
the responses which is not so well.
       202          Welcome
Last Tuesday night I used the Box M[irror] for the purpose of
restoring the Influence back which may have been lost
thro my lending it to various friends

                    them away to your friends
Last Tuesday my friend asked a question which you
kindly said you would enquire about. [see note on previous page that refers to p. 27 response 133]
My Seer said the person is there
      212      She must look sharp, the person is
                  not quite honest.
                  the person will walk,
                  I will use the power I have got
                 He will come to you tomorrow between
                  2 and 3 oClock. you must be firm and
                  not say yes before I speak to you
                  again
                         Let him make to you a proposit'n
                   after this I will advise you again
                   He may want to use you for his profit 
                    for his own interest, and advantage
                    do not do any thing before I see you
                    again.
My Seer said I feel a weight just as if someone had
sat down in my lamp & put their arms round my
next.
I mentioned it
        213        That is right
                       It is a spirit physician, he has
                      mesmerised her for her good
I asked relative to a vision my seer had seen the day
before
            214         I will.
                           This vision is somebody who before long
                           you will do some business with, this
                           will be very sincere and good for you
                           do you recollect well the color of the 
                           person that you saw.

Louise:
Yes I do
              215           Look again & you will see
The Vision
The man is here he is more than 30
years of age he is in the same dress I saw him
a round hat, black hair long nose rather a long
43
Face, a moustache but no whiskers, he looks English
at least he does not look like a frenchman, he has got on
dark clothes, rather brown, dressed well, palet of
black Handf. his shirt collar falls down broad
he looks quite a gentleman, he has got a great many 
spirits round him
My seer made some remark
      216            Not answer to night.,  For this the time
                         is not yet come, when it is time and
                         you speak to him, I will give you 
                         advice the Tuesday Evening before, and
                         you must take notice what I say to you
                         and not do any more nor less,
                         remember this.

[strikethough "hes gone"] he has saluted me with his hand Now hes
turned round & saluted me with both hands. hes gone
2' past 8 PM
                         Now heres an old lady in a carriage
in a white bonnet pink flower on the one side and a 
white feather on the left side. She is dressed beautiful
a very dark lady, I seem to know her face, she is in
a carriage with two beautiful brown horses. the coach
man has on dark blue livery, white stockings & long
silver buckles in his shoes round the hat a silver
band. a footman behind in the same livery
I have seen the carriage - I know her [strikethrough "its Mrs Cohen"]
heres a word coming
         217          Certainly you have seen me before
                         and you will see me again. you 
                         have rode in my Carriage many
                         times
My seer s'd Oh it is Mrs Cohen, she died 2 years ago last
Christmas
          218         I let you see me in the state. I
                         received the permission of the Guardian
                         of this mirror yesterday, I watched
                         your thoughts.
                                   Now if it will give you satisfaction
                         you have a power to see in the mirror
                         thru a gift of the Creator.
44
219 I permitted this vision to you to make
you sure that it is not your imagination.
It is God's gift.
You may see clear some days & 
on others not see any thing, you must
not be alarmed at this and not say
why don't I see tonight, I saw yesterday.
The reason is your system is not
fit sometimes to receive a communication
Sometimes the influence you receive
in the day, sometimes its the weather
sometimes it is the health, the dispon.
of the mind and brain.  This power
will go and come.
It is for this that no one may be
proud of it, they must say to themselves
I thank God it is a great gift
You may have it today & not tomorrow
Now take my advice & be always passive
and quiet.

I thank you much for your advice
220 Certainly
I will give advice to you to her and to
every one that needs it my mission is
to do so, I will come very often near
her & dispose her system to receive these
manifestations to progress rapidly

As to my ever seeing in the [?]
221 You may, if you try, I am afraid your
patience is not enough for this, you
have not got the gift for that you
have for the impression by writing and
by drawing guided by a spirit

Intended to by the writing
222 Well that will come after a time and
you must look for it, nothing comes
without trouble
Louise will see better in a couple of
months than she does now and read
45
                         rapidly, she may be able on the days
                         she does not see any thing, to draw
                         figures and many things
As for patience I can say without Vanity that no one
on this subject can be more persevering --
       223            That is good and I am glad of it
                         The one that works for the father, works
                         for himself, the one who progresses
                         for the Father progresses for himself

                         I am the messenger of God and you
                         the Servant and the Son., work for this
                         loving Father, and the Father will
                         work for this son too.
                         When you come into Glory, and see the
                         Bright Star before you to guide you
                         to the paradise before God. your father
                         all at once you will receive the recompense
                         of your labor., you will kneel down
                         and say to yourself, any recompense is
                         too great, I never did work enough
                         so as to deserve it. and you will find
                         the father gives a much greater recompense
                         than the work done.
                                Never be tired to work for the
                         advancement of your brothers & sisters
                         do so from the Charity of your heart.
                                  I will never be tired myself to
                         come to you. Call me at any time
                         and to your call I will answer.
                                  If any Evening I cannot come
                         receive the one I send in my place
                         he is of the same power as I am 
                         myself, and do not fret if sometimes
                         I send a spirit to answer for me.
                         If I can help it I will not send
                         any one, I am happier to come
                         myself.
May I ask some questions for my advancement on Spiritual
Knowledge
46
      224            Of course I will answer any thing
                         that is necessary
do you see my Seer Louise
      225             Certainly
do you also see me
     226             I see you the same and I see your 
                         mind
do you see me immediately -- or thru the medium of the Seer
      227            Through the Seer.
                         during the time the Seer is in Seance
                         She is controlled by my magnetic
                         Electric power, and through this I 
                         see and hear and answer.
Then if the Seer were now to leave the room, you would
not be able to See or hear me.
       228            No, Each creature is used by the
                         power he has got, by the gift he has.
                         This Seer has got 5 faculties her
                         hearing seeing and also seeing the
                         Spirit not in the mirror, hear music
                         the Choirs of the Spirit World, See
                         gardens flowers fruits all at once
                         Come before her. & Views like a panorama
                         & She will be a Spirit drawing Medium
                                   She receives too Spirit manifest'ns
                         when it is needed tho she is less
                         disposed so she does not covet it
                         for all that She must steadily
                         work for progress
As to my [Mars sign] die Conversings with the C[rowned] A[ngel] alone by myself
         229          I am with you very often
As to his being able to induce or develop my Sight
         230         My power is not given free for you
                         to See. If God does not give permission
                         to the Spirit he cannot pass the point
                         which God fixes   remember that for
                         Ever. When I tell you I cannot
                         do what you ask me to do, do not
                         ask me again, If I can I will
47
                         I will tell you so --- Yes.
I made a remark about my not forgiving Mrs. Leas treachery.
      231             I do not tell you to love her, leave
                         the person and never think any thing
                         more -- not do her harm, and leave
                         it free when one day she may come to you
                         himself to excuse her Conduct -- you
                         can say Freely I did forgive a long time
                         ago. go away far from me and never
                         Come again.
                         When you meet in the Spirit World She
                         will be ashamed for what she has done
                         to you, and she must be punished --
                         For you no Vengeance, that is my advice.

                         I was [?] any power that gave you
                         the impression to do so. -- but let me
                         tell you I am always near you
advice as to my Father
      232            Not now, I will remember it a second
                         time if you ask me again
Some other Tuesday do you mean
      233            Yes
                         I will examine the old man & let you
                         know
Shall I ask you next Tuesday
      234            You may  If I have done the work
                         I will answer, if I have not done so
                         put it off to another day, I will say he
                         is a very strange man.
As to my mother appearing in the M[irror] at her wish, not mine/
       235           That is not in my power, a greater
                         power than mine to ask that
                         I told you before, when she is permitted
                         She will come and I will guide her the
                         proper way,
                               Leave her soul to rest quiet & passive
                         to progress that she may receive the power
                         and the permission to come
48
                         you may be a few years before you see her
                         or even in a short time     I cannot tell
I will wait your informing me
      236           Take my advice that is all
                         Thoroughly believe
May we receive thru your Kindness a Vision
      237             I am rather in a hurry. I will show her
                         a short one. a satisfaction for her too
Now the C[rowned] A[ngel]'s gone.
Its clouded
The Vision
        238          "Look at my House"
The House is all Gold the top is
white    I see 4 windows that look like large glass.
theres flowers down a garden with large green Lawn
and theres a stone looks like silver and diamond,
and now theres some beautiful spirits looking not
of abundance -- Now heres a very big home come with
a garden and a green lawn. and Spirits looking thru'
Every Colored flower, they are so beautiful  I smell the
mignonette  Now before the house theres the green
lawn and the garden and the Spirits are all
together. they are singing    I hear the music     such 
delightful Harmony    theres Several groups of Spirits,
Some Spirits appear nearly naked, only Covered
with flowers and the little children        they look so 
pretty, they run in and out among the flowers &
behind the rose trees,
                     Now here's a beautiful bird with feathers
just like Gold -- the Children Keep on running about
& playing & talking altogether so pretty.  theres
four Angels flying over their Shoulders   Some with
wings some without, heres a very tall grand
Angelic Spirit come in, he looks so pleased to see
the Children play -- Now theres a Spirit with a
Trumpet all are going to him, and Every time
he sounds the trumpet all the Spirits go to him
he's a long way off, he points different ways and
the Spirits separate and go away
49
                         Theres one spirit has got the Children
and guiding them, he looks old but very bright
they are all in the garden now, the children say they
will come again to play bye & bye., he has got
a little book he is teaching some of the Children
they are sitting round a large broad table, he is 
teaching them to pray, oh it looks so beautiful
Now there are 4 very tall Spirits      middle aged teachs
the Children --- Now its crossing over.
     239             This is the Sphere of the Childrens
                         place -- it is to show you that when
                         Children die young upon Earth
                         they must be taught in the Spiritual
                         World, they cannot come to your 
                         Sphere before they learn to read & write
                                     Persons who die in your world
                         if he does not know how to read & write
                         when he is in the Spirit World he 
                         has to learn. this shows to you there
                         is a progress there -- only it is more
                         rapid here than with yourselves
                                     I tell you why in this Spirit
                         World there is no selfishness -- no pride
                         no falsehood only the Truth. and
                         therefore the progress is rapid -- Your
                         Sphere is imperfect
                         Now that is Enough for to night.
'to me,             be pleased to accept of me to take you
        240          home

Japan Crystal
12' to 8 PM      Invoked the Spirit to appear who last
                         promised to take charge of this Crystal
The Spirit did not appear or give any response but the follw'd
Vision
     241              Here is the house I have drawn & on Each
Side a Spirit, there is a garden of flowers very far away
and the Stone which looked like silver or Gold & brilliants
and theres a Spirit theres a figure Come like a Chinese [marking]
with a very flat face and a long tress at the back of 
his head -- Now there is a Chinese woman & child come
The Chinaman has got on his hand a splendid ring it
Shines brilliantly. the house and gardens are still
there  the house is at B. he walks about as if he was at
home now theres two beautiful bright angels come
Each has a flower in his hand, they have golden Colored
dresses, fair hair but no wings --
                         Now the house is gone and these two
Angels are praying they are two beautiful Creatures
                         Now theres such a wretched looking
man dressed like a European, so wretched, his hair all
stands up the two Spirits walk to him
      "he asks them the way to a better Sphere he is
      so wretched"
Now the 2 Spirits appear to make him brighter each
lays hold of his hand. and appear to draw him
to a small bright road or path, the ground looks
blue and a beautiful flame goes before the poor man
Now his clothes changed all at once, his hair
appears combed and it lays down nicely, the angel
passes his hand over his head as tho to smooth it
the man kneels down and is very thankful, he is
in a nice place and looks about every way, he does
not appear to know where he is, but he looks more
comfortable, he is feeling himself all over as tho he
was not sure his clothes were changed --- Now
51
the Spirit says to him
      242            Now you must feel more Comfortable
                         and at rest. Now you have found the
                         Sphere which you belong to.
                         Come with me before the Judgment
                         and receive your mission from the
                         great Creator, mind what the mission
                         is you receive, look well, be steady and
                         do your mission with love and harmony
                         and truth -- look down yourself like
                         my brother and me have done to you
                         try to raise their fortune, try to teach
                         them to leave off all selfishness &
                         proud thoughts -- only turn your
                         hearts to charity & love
                                   Now come & prepare your soul to
                         receive this great judgment, prepare
                         your mind, do not be afraid of any 
                         thing that the Father may tell you
                         like Every thing passively & steadfast
                         and be thankful for what he gives to
                         you -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
here the reading became too small to read
      243            Receive every thing and Say not a Word
                          do not answer but with thanks
                         look on the right hand side and 
                         see your past life. Now look
                         opposite and see the future Coming 
                         before you.
Now the man trembles and looks afraid to go before
the Judge.
Now the other Spirit Says
      244           No trembling, take your powers, receive
                         your sentence with faithfulness and
                         Love.
Now that place is all gone. I see a very bright place
There is a very bright Spirit and he has sat down
upon a very beautiful arm Chair in his left hand
52
he has a large Cross in the right the balance & over
it "Love and Faith" --
                         Now the mans Come again & he has
put the forefinger on the side of the balance, theres 
like a needle that is to show his life for the future
The great Spirit says to him
     245             Now look straight before you look
                         at this book at page 89. there 
                         you will find your mission and
                         you will read on the side your life
                         passed, and by your judgement you
                         will judge yourself.--You will take
                         the punishment you think proper
Now the poor man humbles he kneels and two bright
Angels come to him & raise him up. the man thinks
it is a Hell coming before him
The angel says
        246           on the sphere of my Father no hell 
                         comes  it is only to show the mind
                         the passed life and Show the
                         Spiritual present life. Now take to
                         yourself comfort     my Father Angel,
                         all, if his Son is truly penitent
                         from the bottom of his heart & soul
                         You have my brother come to the
                         Glory and the Sphere of the purification
                         You will progress if you will take 
                         the trouble
                                  Receive kindly that advice which
                         the brother & sister gave to you to 
                         leave behind you the thoughts of your
                         past life and only think now of the 
                         approaching life, and try to progress
                         rapidly
                                    You will find Every thing
                         proper to help you, to teach you
                         and to give you every opportunity of
                         progressing rapidly
now the man looks so happy he rubs his hand
53
with pleasure     he kneels down near this beautiful
Spirit who is sitting and there he prays and
the Spirits put his hand on his head & said
   247                 Rise Rise you will see him who
                         has got your judgment in his hands
                         now take my advice and work and
                         when the time comes go to my
                         Father and be not afraid he loves
                         his children and he is pleased to
                         see each child progress., go home
                         to your Sphere and rest happy and
                         try to receive by spiritual food the
                         purification of your impure Soul.
Now the two bright angels take him back to his
Sphere. they show him all over and Every Spirit
Comes to him and Say to him
     248              Welcome       Welcome
Now the mans speaking to himself & says
     249              Well I asked to be dead 20 years
                         sooner. When I was alive I thought
                         to go down to Hell, to burn & to suffer
                         so much. I see all the tales the
                         Fathers & mothers tell to their Children
                         in ignorance.
                                     Ignorant poor Creatures, poor
                         human beings you do not know
                         better how to teach your Children
                         Now I am on the line of the truth
                         on the line of love and to progress by
                         myself. Oh pleased I am to 
                          meet here such good friends that
                         I never did find alive, no one like
                         it     I never saw any thing so
                         beautiful as the place where this
                         bright guide guided me to receive
                         my present judgment   my judgment
                         is very sweet  a great deal better
                         than I expected, Now Thomas tho
54
    249              Speaks to himself Oh you must work
                         to progress to the same point as
                         the one who has shown you such a
                         beautiful bright brother. I do not
                         know that he is a brother. but he
                         looks like it     Every one looks here
                         like a brother. that shows it because
                         I began to feel my heart belongs to
                         Each one here, I feel I love every
                         one., Oh this is true love, Oh I
                         am so pleased to find myself in 
                         the Spiritual World   my hard work
                         is to be done here -- not half or a quarter
                         of the life I used to live
Now he goes to all and says how do you do & shakes
hands and looks so happy. Now I see the Spirit
group and the Sphere is Closed and three
beautiful Spirits cross over the sphere and Come
down to another. It is the same as I saw before
now its stopped.  its all gone.
May I ask who showed this Vision
      250            I have got the permission
                         My name was when I was alive
                         Thomas Elliott

                         I am dead. 52 years on the 2oth of
                         last June.
                         My life was rather rough. I would 
                         say I had not done a great deal 
                         of bad. but I had not done good
                         Enough  for this I show you the
                         same Vision     I did myself pass
                         through.
                        
                         Remember me I will show you
                         some more when the opportunity
                         is given
within material body -

I thanked him &c

                will try to teach you and make you
                understand my Spirit Home. it is a

                upon the mind a doubt that it is not
                true. but you will shortly -- -- -- --
                ---
                ---

                the pure truth   I spoke to you to show
                you what I did pass this way

he is gone 25 ' to 9 PM
Earl Stanhopes Crystal
20' to 9       Invoked the Spirit of the Crystal
Now theres a Spirit come very bright without wings
She has very nice brown hair, beautiful face
long nose small mouth open forehead. She appears
56
very bright, her dress is purple, She has a flower in
her hand, its a long fleur de lis before opening --
May I ask your name
   253      Call me Charlotte
was that your name on this Earth
   254     Yes that was my Name when I 
                was in your Sphere
                now I call myself
                          LILE
                my flower is the same as my state
                it is my favorite flower in any
                Sphere
                I am pretty well high up _ I am
                not now come to you for a lie
I casually remarked to my Seer that was rather a
low remark for a Spirit rather High up -- when the
Lady Spirit replied
    255      Your are right, when I was alive I was
                rather vulgar at one time, after my
                marriage I was obliged to Change
                my manners and become a lady
                       My beauty gave me a rich
                husband but it did not give to
                me a pure Soul   it is many years
                since I was in your life certainly
                       I will come now and talk to 
                you of the manners of the Spiritual
                World in Changing the life. I have
                changed my wrongs & feelings, I
                feel now I ought to fit myself
                to see above me.
                         I see the people of your Sphere
                and I see the State I was in before
                I died I thought my rank so
                great [strikethrough "before I died"] after I married
                a gentleman that it gave to my
                thoughts only pride and selfishness
                and I lost the good feelings which
57
  256       I possessed in my rude state before      
                I was a lady -- Lady Sidney
                        Now in my Sphere there is no
                 Lady -- only [strikethrough "a"] Sister and brother
                Oh how I pity the one that is rich
                and proud -- riches & pride give
                to their hearts corruption selfishness
                and untruthfulness and destroys their
                feelings of Charity.
                           Now your Seer was once richer
                but make yourself happy your position
                is brighter than many a rich Lord in
                England ---
                            The Lord looks down upon the
                poor if the heart and mind are
                Elevated and God perceives them
                from State and has great compassion
                and love for them and he truly
                cares for them and think of them every
                prominent day and night.
                             Sometimes you grieve yourself
                poor Louise Oh think yourself
                far higher than the one that has
                so much Gold & many diamonds
                when he comes to the Spirit - Home
                he will find his mistake, there
                are no Gold or diamonds only
                pure hearts, pure hearts & free
                minds loving and truthful are
                what God requires. --
                Pass over.
She is gone 9 PM
Now the Spirit is here again, & says 
    257       I died in Egypt of Consumption
                and left two children    my husband
                died 3 years after me at Paris in
                France.
                My home was 83 Park Lane
58
May I ask in what year you died
   258      I died 20 years & 6 months, and I 
                died 2 days before Christmas --
                22 years next Christmas, my Son is
                24 years old.
                I knew a man, he used to travel with
                me, he is now very old & poor if I was
                alive I would give him great fortune
                I will give the name if you desire it
We shall be pleased to receive it
    259      Joseph Monsiegn
are you happy
    260     I am happy and bright, but I am 
                not quite pure enough
May I ask in what sphere you are in
    261      I am in the 5th Sphere.   I began to get
                on very well. I have got a great
                deal more to progress before __ __ __ __ __ __ __
                I knew this medium too a long time
                ago and she used to receive manifestations
It is very Curious you remember persons still being on
this Earth.
     262     That depends whether God gives the
                permission --- ---
                -- --- -- --
                I will tell you another thing I am 
                very often in your Sphere and Come
                to you, I remember the time past it
                comes to me, as if I read a book
                and recollected it. Now I may in a 
                few years forget every time, Every
                feeling and memory of the life.
                When I leave off Coming to you here.

                It is this way you receive Communications
                from the Spirit that belong to your
                Earth.  by Electric power from an
                Elevated Sphere you receive communication
                and Visions.

   263       One thing if the person was not
                  fitted to this Elevated Magnetic
                  Electric power. She could not
                  transmit the words,
                        The medium receives the transmission 
                  belonging to the Sphere where
                  __ __ __ __ __ __ and the magnetic-Electro
                  power when accumulated to her body
                  and thus if her Soul is Elevated
                  She is enabled to transmit many
                  sorts of communications by difficult
                  Spheres.
                           If the medium is a low [?]
                  Spirit he cannot go any further
                  than where his soul belongs to, if
                  his Soul is Evil he receives Evil
                  Communications & evil transmissions
                          The medium rapping & moving 
                  of furniture is a low Spirit who does
                  the work for greater Spirits, the great
                  Sprits do not come and rap and
                 move furniture, but reserve his
                  power for great & higher manifestations

                  Now this instruction may here be 
                  necessary for you for the future

                   C. A. Mirror
20' to 8 PM     Invoked the C[rowned] A[ngel]
Instantly
The CA is here
    265        Welcome.
May I now mention that the Stranger you informed my Seer
would call upon her on tuesd'/ between 2 & 3. -- called on 
Saturday about 3. -- he exactly resembled the Gentleman
 Shown in the Mirror, He declined to give his name or
address but after some stated that Dr. Harrison & his Lady
had ment'd Madames B's name., he asked her if she had
a Brother__ Stated he had come from Mexico, and promised
to call again. Madame B. states she never saw
him before to her knowledge.
    266        He will come again at the end of the
                  week. --
                  Your Seer must not be frightened or
                  alarmed, this Gentleman is sent by
                  her Brother from Mexico.__ Your brother
                  has sought after you 5 years, he
                  is single this Gentleman is his great
                  friend    he will come again, give
                  you his name & tell you why he has 
                  come to you.
                         He was astonished to find you
                  in this State after what your brother
61

    267       had told him of the position you
                  had in France --
                          Now be patient & passive you will
                  See Something astonishing Soon
                  you must not fret, receive the Visit
                  like as if it had fallen down from
                  Heaven, tomorrow at 2 oClock you
                  will see a lady -- old dressed in
                  black. Grey hair long nose, long
                  face, thin and pale. She will appear
                  to you a perfect stranger, -- you will
                  be strong, and receive this visit
                  coldly, do not say any word about
                  your position, hear what she will
                  say but do not answer.

   268        Remember what I tell you.
                  a great amount of money will be
                  offered to you, do not accept it  &
                  refuse it. Say you do not need it
                  take my advice and I will guide
                  you properly.  That's all.
I returned thanks for Louise & sd she would endeavor
to follow the CA's advice, & trust all would be for the best
    269        She must trust in God -- as I
                  who am a bright Spirit. Trust
                  in prudence and in your guide
                  This is your best friend he would
                  not offer you any money, but he
                  will find for you the prudence
                  and the way. -- Trust yourself
                  to God the father. and say to Him
                         Oh God, only you Know my
                  heart. Only You Know my thoughts,
                  protect me now & forever.--
                          He Himself will drive away
                  the Evil and Send the pure to direct
62

                  your Soul and every day make your
                  progress--
                         Yes sometime & you pray
                  Oh God hear my prayer. If I am 
                  fit to leave this impure Sphere, Oh
                  Call me your Child Oh Love me &
                  protect me forever.

    270        This strange Visit would not hurt
                  you, only you do not understand it, by
                  this man you will get something
                  that will benefit you., but the woman
                  who will come tomorrow comes only
                  out of curiosity       nothing more.

                  Look rich & proud. You will cast her
                  down.
We were Conversing together upon this Singular response &
the circumstances [?] to which Louise owned she
could not understand when the CA said
     271        I dare say you do not understand it
                  You will understand it when the 
                  time is come --
                  When the Woman is in your Room
                  3 knocks will [strikethrough "come"] advise you on
                  the left side of your door. and this
                  will let you know that a Spirit is
                  Near you. This Spirit will protect
                  you and give to you the power Strength
                  and the Spirit to answer properly.
                  Thats all
May I observe that if my prior wife had been living 
this would be her 50th birthday -- I hope &c.
      272       She will progress so long as she trusts
                  in a loving Father. He will send to
                  her a loving [?]ing to show her the
                  way to progress and purify herself
                  to enter Heaven pure as fair.
                           Now do not be alarmed nor dwell
63

   272         about Sarahs state or position.  She is
                  happy for her state and a great deal
                  better than when she was alive & 
                  suffering, She would not desire to 
                  come again to breathe the impure
                  [strikethrough "air"] Sphere to which you belong
                  of Selfishness & Pride, unjust and 
                  unloving.
                            Here in her Sphere she finds
                  loving hearts & true minds and there
                  she may love herself and rest -- and
                  receive the blessings of Heaven and
                  and aspire to rise to higher glory
                            Oh do not be uneasy for her.
                  it is true and right to think of her
                  sometimes and to ask her Heavenly
                  Father to forgive the wickedness which the
                  Soul did when alive and to give her
                  his loving water to drink -- This
                  pure water which falls down from
                  Heaven upon each heart & each thought
                  The better is the brain for giving
                  a bath to the Spirit body aye to make
                  it clear & sweet to pass from this 
                  Sphere and Enter a pure one.
     273       Certainly if today is her birthday
                  She will receive in the Spiritual World
                  a better birthday than the one you
                  used to give to her.
I thank you, I went to Dr. [?] this morning
he gave me a prescription -- & advised me to get married
again -- may &c.
    274       This is not in my power to tell you
                  if this man has foolish thoughts
                  in his head. I am sorry for it
                             If your mission is to get married
                  again, the Creator would not send
                  foolish thoughts by this man     He
64

    274        would direct you the road by giving
                  you the impression. He must guide
                  your Steps, that may Come to you
                  one day My Mission is not to tell
                  the future unless it was something
                  that would hurt you    then I would
                  give you advice & try to prevent the
                  Trouble, I leave this to the One
                  who gives each Creature its mission 
                  To the one who is the master and 
                  a power greater than myself.
                           You would get better if you
                  would was your head with vinegar
                  & water., at least put on the head
                  a rag soaked with Vinegar & water
                  Try this and if that dont do, you 
                  enough Good, I will tell you Some-
                  thing more, I have no doubt that
                  will help you.
I thank you I will try it after I have gone thro Dr Epps
course.
     275        That will not hurt you   You might
                  do it all at the same time, it is
                  only the blood come up to your head
I remarked to my fear that Dr. Ellertson ordered me some years
ago, a similar, indeed the same only gin was mixed
with it when the CA said
      276     Well you may do so too, a glassful
                  of vinegar, a glassful of Gin & 
                  two glassfulls of water.
Was that Dr. Es' quantities
     277       I do not recollect.
                  You will feel in 2 or 3 days better
As to my arrangements for my Father
    278        That is right
                  do your duty & God will do his own
My dear G S I[m] always & in all things desire to be
& act in Sincerity & truthfulness towards you, & I have
said I would in good faith believe you are the same
65

Spirit the Same C.A. to whom this Mirror was dedicated
& took upon yourself the office of my Guardian Spirit
before I had that happy privilege I was in my relig's
belief a unitarian -- from your precepts & teachings
I became convinced of the divine birth of Our Lord J.C.
and the writings you gave me Enforced that belief
It does therefore appear strange to me that when
you direct us to pray to God you never use the name
of Our Lord.
      279      If I saw you were not truthful
                  I would cut my Visit Short
                  I would not trouble myself to come
                  So Speedily to teach you.
                  I see you are truthful and it is
                  for that I will help you
      280     Jesus Christ is a Spirit like myself
                  and certainly a high Spirit in Heaven
                  The one who trusts himself in God
                  trusts himself in Jesus Christ --
                  The one who calls upon God the Father
                  Calls upon Jesus Christ.
                  Jesus Christs does like an other
                  brother and Sister he asks after the
                  order of the King of Heaven.
                 Certainly Commend Your Soul to
                  Jesus Christ pray to him and he will
                   transmit to his Father your prayer
                  and your request and he will send
                  to you some messenger to give you
                  that advice and that impression
                          If I have not mentioned this
                  name its for the conversation __ __ __ __ __ __
                  __ __ __ __
                  Now for the future I will guide you
                  to the world order of Jesus Christ
                  Jesus Christ is so high & pure a Spirit
                  it is above the greatest Spirit to call
66

                    him for Small or trifling things
                    when you have the higher visions &
                    the best instructions, you will receive
                    this Blessed name very often
                         "The Lord [Christ] Jesus Christ"
I am pleased I mentioned this as it has troubled me 
much lately and I wish to deal with you openly 
candidly & truthfully.
      281       You need not trouble yourself for this
                    It is not necessary to mention his name
                    for Love. If you have got this in
                    your heart Jesus Christ Sees your
                    heart and Knows your love he knows
                    when you pray to him, for he gives 
                    it to God his father and transmits
                    Your prayer to him.
                               Now rest in Quiet & do not be
                    afraid     I love Jesus Christ the Lord,
                    of Heaven.  The Son of God the father
                    who forever will Give my heart & Love
                   for he transmits that prayer to God
                    for he prays for each of those who
                    love him truly --
                         I pray for you as I pray for
                    myself.   I pray for all who loves
                    God and Jesus Christ.
                          This true love from a pure heart
                    Elevated thro thought goes to the
                    heart of the Father. The Father
                    with love looks down upon his children
                    and gives as a recompense the
                    blessing & the Communication to those who
                    thoroly believe in him, and trust
                    themselves in Him, heart & Soul --
                    He who trusts himself in his power
                    and providence receives by his Messenger
                    their reward & instructions
67

                  Oh Lord give to these two Creatures
                  Your protection and your blessing
                  raise these two impure Creatures to
                  Heaven and give them the power to
                  bear their troubles. & to perceive and
                  progress in a true State.
                  Oh Lord thy will be done in blessing
                  all.
We were discoursing on the progress the Seer had made
notwithstanding the difficulties occasioned by her not knowing
our Language fluently when the C[rowned] A[ngel] said
     282       Do not be afraid you will receive
                  greater & higher Instructions than 
                  this    You said -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- ---- --
      283      Jesus Christ was a man, like 
                  any other man, only he was born
                  pure and Chosen by God the Father
                  who sent him to your Sphere to teach
                  the Infidel, to raise the Jews to
                  give instruction to the minds of
                  men.    and to teach this loving
                  religion & doctrine to those who did
                  not believe in God., who did not 
                  believe in a Soul.
                            Jesus Christ was at birth pure
                  & Elevated In paradise     he was Sent
                  to your world for its purification
                  to the Infidel to the one who said
                  there was no God no Heaven.
                  and after the teaching of Jesus
                  Christs doctrine, only one religion
                  only one belief, to Love God to
                  Love Mothers & [?], to help one
                  another to act and teach the Truth
                  to break down ignorance and try to
                  fix in the brain to Strong [del?]
                  to break off this Impurity and to
                  rise into the line of Love and Truth
                  It was for this that Jesus Chris was Chosen
Mr. Dawson please show mercy as that I live a life that is full of oppression. I beg you till I am unimpressed.

             When Joseph was Chosen for his Father
             that was            belonged to the power --
             the great mercy of God
Here the Seer had to leave for a minute or two
And the C[rowned] A[ngel] resumed.
   284    Yes. Joseph received a Vision that he
              was to become the Chosen Companion of
             Mary -- that Mary was to be a mother
             by God's Impression.
             --
             --
             --  [see previous page for a note about Seer]
             --
             --
             --
I remarked to the Seer that I could not follow her when
the C.A. Said
  285    Before you go you must read what
             you have put down and if some of
             the words you cannot make out
             I will give the instruction & the impress'n
             to Louise
             I think myself She progresses very
             rapidly and I am pleased at it
             before long She will be a great Seer
             You cannot complain much, you
             get on I think very nicely indeed
             --   do you hear?
yes       She never learned the language
             yet She speaks very well
             do you understand me?
yes       I will teach her to speak well give
             the answers word by word, letter
             by letter, this will give you greater
             facility to put down sentences
             Will that do?
I replied &c
    286   You will have it & do it all right
              Now -- progress together truly and
69

             faithfully that i all I [must] require
             of you.
I thank you for myself & my Seer

On [Jupiter sign] die last I used my Japan Crystal & the late 
Earl Stanhopes Crystal. and two Spirits appeared who
said that when on this Earth their names were
             Thomas Elliott &
             Charlotte Lady Sidney
They gave us two very interesting Visions of passages in
the lower Spheres.
   287   You will receive a great many more
             Showing the passage from Sphere
             to Sphere like as you go from one
             Tram to another when travelling and
             when she is fixed in a very high Sphere
             She may stay some [weeks] months
             this is for teaching the Line if She
             does pass thro' when she leaves off
             the life in this Sphere She will not 
             have to go there. that is a mission
             given to her and I cannot tell you
             any further
             Each is vision is necessary for you both
             only you do not understand it thoroly
             well
             You think it is very astonishing it is
             indeed a great power and the one
             who has it, may indeed consider it
             a great blessing & be very thankful
             to the great power that transmits this 
             to her --
             that is all
I ret'd thanks 
  288     Welcome farewell the blessing of
             Heaven be with you

Box Mirror          H St.
[venus sign] 25 April 1962
         Invoked the Spirit to whom this 
         mirror was originally dedicated.
20' to 8 PM
The M[irror] clouded & the Seer said Here is the same Spirit as
appeared before (11 April page 31) blue dress, Brown Chestnut 
Hair, I cannot tell whether a man or woman -- yet a very
nice face, a gold girdle round the waist with two cords
& tassels hanging down -- no Wings
The "Letters"
  289       Yes when I am permitted
                 I am not permitted yet, indeed I have
                 got no "letter" yet.
Invoked the Spirit who took charge of this mirror
When I first made it may I ask why he did not Come
     290      He cannot come yet
                  do not be afraid I am a good friend
                  though my power is not so great as
                  the one that guards this mirror
                       Some private mission keeps him
                  away for the present when he is not
                  so much engaged he will come again
                 and satisfy you ---
May I ask the favor of your name that I may Call
you by.
   291         You may call me the Second Messenger
                  of providence -- my name when I was
                  alive was
                          Seraphine
                  just now you Seer said She did not 
                  know whether I was a man or woman
                         I am a Woman, I died young
                  yet suffered a great deal before my
                  death -- and I sympathize very much with you Seer and that attracts me
71

          better to her, I love the one who like
          her Suffered with patience & love. Now
          I am here this day I will look after
          your happiness, I know of your suffering
           in private -- i will cheer you up and
           raise up your thoughts. give Sweetness
           to your [thoughts] heart, lighten your
            trials & enable you to bear them [then] 
            patiently -- to persevere. & progress until
            you come to the "gloria" --
than looking towards me the S said
   292   Now I am ready for the writer 
             right
Are you aware of the nature of the Works  produced by the
old writers on magic
    293    No I am not I am too young
               I may serve you in any other thing
                necessary for your instruction.
with all deference to you I must remark that on matters
appertaining to the Souls welfare we have all our Lords
Own words in the Gospels.  We have also the Epistles of
 his Apostles besides learned Commentators of our own
day.
    294       Rely on the Son of the Father and the
                   Son will transmit your thoughts and
                   desires to the Father ---
                   ---
                   ---
Here the Seer read many apparently disjointed words
with much Energy & less fluency -- & I could not make
sense of it, & I got her to promise to read me a page
or two of some English book that I might better understd.
her manner & diction -- & requested her to read Calmer 
& quieter. When the spirit said
      295       You two creatures do not understand
                    Me.  I hope you will be calm and
                   receive the words properly.
This response (        ) came as I have here written it &
scarcely, if one been Seer, required my correction even
in the Grammar -- and certainly the Seeress could not
either in her ordinary conversation or by writing express
herself so fluently -- but this response did not
come any thing like so easily or fluently tho the meaning
was well given.
72

I began to explain the great difficulty I had to contend
with in regard to my Seers want of knowledge of the Lang'e
& her pronunciation &c when the S said
    296     I will answer for you
                I come just to help your Seer and
                you must Calm yourself
                    When you do not understand the
                word properly, I will repeat the words
                three times if it is necessary.
                     The language must be teached to 
                the brain and the organ of the material
                body with patience and Calm(ness)
                you will get on properly and very quick(ly)
                     I repeat to you again I will tell
                you word for word -- when you finish to
                put down one word, say finish, and
                I will go on again.=
I thank you sincerely for your kind response and regret
troubling you so much.
    297       Nothing will trouble me for a good
                action. --
                I tell you before the one way to 
                pray to Jesus Christ & to pray to his 
                Father. -- to the one to beg his favor
                and perfection and J.C. goes himself
                to God to ask Him to give you this
                blessing. --
                      And if this you See and Seer, does not
                pronounce the name of J.C. I will tell
                you why.
                       Your Seers belief and her religion is
                very like yours, only the Catholics pray
                first to God, and look to the Almighty
                for favor & protection
                      After their prayer to God they pray
                to Jesus Christ. They know very well
                that Jesus Christ cannot give the pardon
Victor has needed multiple for that the love of my life is no longer here to protect him.
I truly am honored by your sacrifice. 
73

                to the guilty, If the Great-Lord of
                Heaven do not give the Sentence
I again began to repeat the difficulty I labored under but 
was cut short by the Spirit saying
     298      She will improve Soon
                Ask her in what state She was at
                9 oClock last night, 3 Spirits came
                to her and mesmerised her brain, touched
                her organs -- gave a passive power to
                her Soul -- rendered her body as
                though she were dead, and she was
                in this condition all the night, the
                Spirits worked hard to dispose her
                to receive -- great Sentence, great Manifest'ns
                to teach those that are ignorant
I hope these visions of the night and trance states will
not be hurtful to thee Seers health, I am much afraid
of them from long experience
     299     It will not so long as good Spirits
                are with her
                     Were Evil to take possession he might
                affect her brain, she has a good friend 
                to come to her
I have been promised a flower to be given to me by others
Spirit influence & power --
     300      Yes you will have it -- Your Guardian
                Spirit the CA promised you that.
                You will receive it certainly
I shall indeed be gratified if I do, it will be the
most [?] Spiritual [strikethrough East] fact that has occurred
to me -- being at the same time both Spiritual & Material.
     301     Oh yes, you will see a great many time
                your labor must be paid -- in this life
                and in the Spiritual life too.
                     After your death your book will
                Certainly be read, and may be give
                good instruction to Some men who

                never understand this -- they may
                be very pleased and read, read and
                read it again to their great satisfaction
I said some remarks as to having writing a fair transcript
of all the dialogues & visions which had taken place
thru my Crystals & Mirrors &c for the last ten years -- which
I had received from Numerous Spirits & predominantly my
Kind G[uardian] S[pirit] the Crowned Angel.
    302      That is right
                The one who may -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -
                receive the words which came down from
                Heaven to you this the power of this great
                Spirit. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
                that i must insure great respect, and show 
                that by putting this in respectable
                hands we did not abuse the power
                and after having spent so many years
                & so much attention upon your work
                I dare say your Soul would be
                after your death worried a great deal
                if you Saw your work badly cared
                for -- I hope it will not come to this--
                You will not be surprized if before 
                you leave this Sphere you will receive
                some impression to direct your mind
                to the disposal of this great blessing
                       Better had your books be banned
                than fall into bad hands -- I hope
                not -- I dare say some will be prepared
                to receive your book. and keep the same
                collection properly
                        do you understand my friend
I stated my hopes & intentions as to their ultimate
dispersal.
   303       Now look over what I have given, if
                any thing is not right I will help you
                I have got one hour & a half at your
                disposition --
75

I am much obliged by the trouble you take
     304      You are very welcome, no trouble to
                  me if it is a good action
May I ask if you and other Spirits give the responses from
your own knowledge of our Language or whether you search
the brain of the Seer for the language & words to do the (express)
your ideas with -- have I made myself understood
      305      Yes my friend I understand you
                        myself.
                   " not this the mind of the Seer. her true
                   " her power, it is true tho her power to
                   " you "
This not proving very intelligible & while Conversing with
my Seer there came
        306   Not thro the mind of the Seer but
                  through the power which God.  has
                  given to her -- and through this
                  Electric power. which comes to the
                  Spirit he takes possession of the 
                  Seer at the time when she is in 
                  Seance.
                          This is the truth.
                  When She is more developed her only
                  Sitting near the mirror will cause
                  the words to come fluently letter by
                  letter 
       307            do you understand my friend
                  You must remember that some days
                  the Spirit is not so well disposed
                  that depends upon the body of the
                  Sphere and the atmosphere. You
                  may have got a Splendid day but
                  it may not be fit for a Spirit, a
                  pure Spirit to come down thru the
                  atmosphere there may be some bad
                  influence in your atmosphere., for
                  tonight I have felt perfectly well
                  easy & passive.
76

                  Last night the blood of the Seer was much
                  moved by the purification of the Spirit who
                  mesmerized her with great power to develope
                  [strikethrough the] her system to receive the communication 
                  and to enable her to transmit it to you by
                  speaking. now do you understand it
You were formerly on this Earth but may I &c.
      308      Yes I told you before
You interrupt me I was going to ask if there were not also
Spirits who had never been embodied on Earth
     309       This is not possible no Spirit can live
                   if he has not got a Spirit body
I was again repeating that I believed there were Spirits
who had never lived on this Earth, but was again
interrupted
     310      You are right some Spirits never have
                  come to this Earth, but their Electricity
                  corresponds to the one that was on this 
                  Earth before
Swedenborg asserts, as I think very erroneously, that there 
are no Spirits in Heaven but once were Men & Women:
       311       I am not a proficient on Swedenborgianism
I was ag'n going on when the S said
                    I understand I tell you
Permit me to say that I think you are talking about 
what you do not understand. For I believe that these
Angels who never did live on this Earth
     312      No each Spirit has been thru the life
                  for to come to a pure Sphere.
I differ with you entirely
     313      Now I will answer you
                  Each spirit must pass thru the purification 
                  and receive his mission for to progress
                  he is not an Angel if he does not progress
                           Before a Spirit becomes an angel
                  he must pass thro' the great Sphere and
                  like the Child born today must grow
77

                  grow up and progress and so does
                  the Spirit
                        Now receive once for all, there is no
                  Angel that was not a man or Woman
                  once.
     314              Certainly children if they die young
                  progress quickly into Purity, but no
                  Child dies pure directly they have
                  sucked the breast, the impure blood,
                  the require purification to enter a
                  pure eternity.
Do you know my Guardian Spirit the Crowned Angel
    315        I do
Then he has asserted both of himself & others that
he never had been a mortal or lived on this Earth
    316         This I am not permitted to tell you
                  She may be permitted to tell you
                  herself -- She is a far greater Spirit than
                  I am.
                        I would not tell you any thing
                  in my power that was not permitted
                  Every Spirit sent like me cannot go any
                  farther than he is permitted.
Then you think Spirits may in Some Case not have been
embodied
     317        I told you before No
Then I think you are quite wrong
      318      I am not
I have asked others the Same question
      319      You may have asked what I am not
                   permitted to tell
                       There may be Some Spirits who have
                   belonged to the purity of the King of
                   the Heavens
                        There I must stop and not go any
                   further.
                        Be satisfied with what I have got
78

                   permission to tell you - for myself I am
                   happy.
    320            The Crowned Angel will remind you
                   of the discussion between you and me next
                   time.
                        There always were angels, always for
                   Ever will be angels
                   No one can pass thro these Secrets but
                   the master of the Heavens
                   Now do you understand it
I thank you for your Kind condescension --
                   Welcome
How many States or Spheres are there
      321       So many, so many I cannot tell
                   you I have not yet passed through
                   my Sphere is the 7th
that question appears to much perplex the Spirits for
I get very discordant answers
     322       You get the same answer if you require it
                   I tell you the truth my Sphere is the
                   Seventh, and I do not call myself
                   Elevated Enough yet.
My C.A. has informed me there were only 7 Spheres
in all & then the presence
     323        How long is it since you asked your
                   Guardian Spirit the Crowned Angel.
Five or 6 years
     324        She is a great deal higher now, ask
                   her when She comes again
                   You may receive very high spirits if
                   they Sympathize well with you
                   When a High Spirit sees sincerity &
                   Truth in the heart he likes very much
                   to Come to you & instruct you for your
                   good
                         I will come again and I may be
79

                   be able to give you good conversation
May I ask if you will kindly favor my Seer with
a vision that will interest & instruct us
     325        I will
                   You will now see the the second sphere you
                   saw the first now the 2nd
                   rest 5 minutes
9 PM
In less than 5 minutes the M[irror] clouded
      326      The Vision
     The Clouds are of 3 Colors blue pink white
the dark blue cloud begins to open      I see a large
bright place as tho' gilt all over, now theres a
wide place with a group of men & women  they are
dressed like as but some look more Elevated than
the others, Some are dressed like old court dresses in
blue, yellow, pink dark blue light blue all colors
Now on the left hand side's a large door forming the 
Centre, and theres two men one on each side
                Now I see a Spirit Coming he looks
like a man, very fine looking, the men on each side
of the door have long white hair with [?]
long dress all in one -- & girdles round the middle
& two tassels hanging down, each keeps moving
his hands as tho bidding them to pass., there are
some that cannot go to the door those that stop
look so sorry & dull, they cry & pray & are very
patient.
                Now as I look thru the door, I see
a long broad road very Smooth and neat there
are men & women walking -- some gather flowers
some look wicked, some look steady & penitent
and some look so bad. on the right is the
1st Sphere  it is so wretched  Some are very miserable
wicked, bad, some beg to leave off this State 
80
a great many who are dressed in brown dresses come to the
1st Sphere and draw them from that Sphere to the
2nd a great many Young Creatures like Girls 15
or 20 years old. and the four creatures look so happy
to enter the 2nd Sphere, they seem to change their
state and their dress. --
               Now the first Spheres shut out and
theres the Spirit "Seraphine" at the top of the M[irror] a
long way off. She says
    327      I stay there to protect you from the Evil
                 influence,
                 I think there has been enough of the
                1st Sphere  it might hurt and frighten 
                 you come to the second sphere.
All the first Sphere's gone. Now those that entered
are kneeling down before Seraphine, they are
praying and Seraphine holds her arm up &
points with her finger to Heaven.
     328         Pray to the Father, pray to Jesus
                     Christ -- to send you good impressions
                      make up your minds to progress
                      and to rise to the 3rd Sphere   Suffer
                     with Submission & patience and receive
                     your mission from the one who gives
                     to you the life, bend to his will and
                     ask the Sweetness of his heart, ask 
                     him to look down & forgive the wrongs
                    you have done to your brother & sister
                    when you was in the Sphere which
                    you have just left.
                                Now be steady & think better
                   You will receive from the Great Spirit
                   good advice & instructions how to progress
                    hear the lesson attentively that the
                    Spirit will tell you, go home to your 
                    State and rest in Quiet and wait
81
                     until the time comes to receive the notice
                     to go up to another Sphere where you
                     may receive better comfort.
                           I will pray myself to the 
                     Father for help if I can
                             -- Finish --
                     Now the Spirits are come down they
are more quiet and they look at Seraphine as tho'
they thought her a very great Spirit, she looks
very pleased -- now shes praying to Heaven herself
to the [strikethrough Father] Creator.
                      Now they are all praying together
holding up their hands & Seraphine is at the top
they form just like a pyramid
                     Now there's two young angels with
wings come near Seraphine   they have come down
on each side with very fair hair      they kiss
Seraphine on the forehead and take her away.
                      The Spirits underneath look so Sorry
at her going, they are begging her to come again
and She promises to Come. one of the Spirits looks
quite a young girl, She was one that was in the
1st Sphere. Some of the bright Spirits come down to her &
says
        329      Sister wake up. do not lay down your
                     thoughts, do not be so unhappy
                     rise, rise, heaven is for all
                     God the father did not forget you, if
                     your time is finished in this State
                     come with us to the 3rd Sphere,
                     there you will be brighter & happier
       The group of the Spirits look at this one & are
Sorry to part with this bright Girl, She has given 
to them such a sweet look & says
        330      Brothers & Sisters a great many of you
                     will come soon on my Steps, do not
                     be sorry if I go, rather be pleased
82
                     if I am a step sooner than you
                     you will soon follow me. I will
                     pray and call you
Now one of the beautiful angels has said
      331         I do not come down here to break your 
                     [hearts] happiness    I come down to do
                     the order of the Lord, I do my mission
                     when the Lord gives to us the mission
                     to come down here, we are always 
                     ready & pleased to do a good action
                     for our brothers & sisters. Now be patient
                     & soon your time will come.
There are a great many in this group of Spirits
with the tears running down their cheeks, some
tear their hair and cry as though there were no
more hope.
                      Now theres a very tall Superior look'g
Spirit in a robe, he has in his hand a long Staff
with a cross upon the top, he looks very kind
he is rather dark, like an Italian. He says
        332      Now why do you distress yourselves
                     look at this Cross, and the one
                     who carried it so many years. he
                     did suffer great injuries received 
                     bad treatment called Every Evil
                     Name which human beings could
                     pronounce with their mouth, to
        [*?*]     be refused a Glass of water & a [Cut]
                     [of] Crust of bread received thru -- his
                     flesh the nails to fasten him to the
                     wood, the Jews put him on the
                     Cross and there nailed him up and
                     for this he did not blame   his
                     Father.
                            You must not blame the great
                     Lord if you wish to progress quickly
                     be patient loving & truthful. do
83

                     your duty break down your selfishness
                     break down your bad passions, leave
                     off your bad thoughts, cast off all
                     at once the feelings of the impure
                     life -- think only how to live [strikethrough on] the
                     life for all eternity, as soon as you
                     have broken down this imperfection
                     you will feel better, it is not
                     necessary to think always of the
                     past and the evil pleasures you rec'd
                     when you was on the Earth in the life
                             Now I hope my coming may
                     do good to all, I will visit you very 
                     often if my presence makes you 
                     happy.
I see the Groups of Spirits about  So many a
dozen, a million       the other Spirits hold up both
their hands as tho asking him to come again  he says
     333          I will come soon and guide you 
                     the best way
                            Pray to my brother J.C. he is the
                     one nearest unto God, pray to his
                     principal messenger and he will
                     help you too, pray always for
                     Heavens power and protection
                     Farewell for the present time
The Great Spirit is going he looks so kindly towards
them. -- Now the Spirits are going different ways 
there appears at the back a number of standards
on flags & the spirits are Each going to a different
one in groups -- above & very far away there appears
so many very many bright Spirits praying
The Sphere closed.
      334         The next Vision you will see the 3rd
                     Sphere, I hope my brother & sister
                     you have for this day received satisfaction 
84

I beg you to Accept my thanks for your kindness
& the trouble you have taken -- I hope you do not feel
offended at any thing I have said, altho I may at
times speak my mind freely, I would not for a
moment personally offend any spirit who appears in
good faith.
     335      The truthful Spirits loving one another
                  take no offence. If you were to say
                  that which was not right I would
                  that minute tell you and call you
                  to order.
                       I mean no offence only only Love and
                  truth the blessing of Heaven for all
Seraphines gone

85
                  to or attend any Evil appointments
                  not that it would diminish her power
                  but it would hurt her health. She is
                  not strong enough to be [strikethrough ever bright] &
                  receive such influence --
My Seer had been telling me that she had felt impressed
to go to Mrs. Marobulls on NedSin St. for a sitting as to her
absent brother. but Mrs. M. had declined sitting --Mr.
Nessin invoked for inf'n as to her absent Brother
      340     What you want you will get in a 
                  couple of weeks -- The Lord never leaves
                  a faithful desire -- You desire to find
                  your brother. You will find him be
                  patient, the time will shortly come
                  when you receive  news from him in a
                  Strange way. He is himself very
                  anxious to Know how for the many
                  past years you have Spent your time
                  he loves you very much and thinks
                  ardently of you and he reproaches
                  himself all day that he has left you
                  alone with large Tom for friend
                  no parent. no one [strikethrough of] to look after you
                  in your young days

                  Sprit that guides you and has done
                  for so many years & protected you
                  through great dangers. -- love him truly
                  in your heart he is a great Spirit
                  greater & higher than myself
                   I am not permitted to tell his name.
The C.A. then [?] & said to me, [?],
      341      I am now for yourself.
I was talking about Madam B's brother when the response
came
     342      He is [strikethrough well] alive & well off Single &
                  has a great desire to find his sister

                 
86

                  who he hears has without doubt suffered
                  many trials
                          His cross was very heavy to 
                  carry but Jesus Christ carried his Cross
                  with perseverance & love to His Father
                  dear Child Do the same. The Father will
                  look down upon you & help you and
                  [?] your good Sentiments, do not
                  be afraid now Sometime ago by
                  writing you received the assurance of
                  the protection of God by his minister
                  believe it, it is true.
I made a remark. 
       343            Not any one Spirit can come
                  in the name of God for to deceive those
                  that thoroly believe in the protection
                  of the divinity -- now do you underest'd
                  me
Would her brother appear in this M[irror]
       344     I will try.
May I now ask some questions
                  Certainly
Is Grace H. alive
       345     She is not
Here my Seer suddenly Ejaculated Oh Wonderful, oh
my God I never Saw any thing so beautiful, the
Crowned Angel has risen up in the mirror with two
Such beautiful Angels one on Each Side, all in white
no wings very young & small -- they have each a
Small bow & arrow ornamented with yellow ribbons
        346    I let you See this to cheer you up
                  I see your mind & your Spirit is
                  very low & cast down for the last 
                  two days. & this vision will cheer
                  you, think on your loving Father he
                  will give one the power to rise you
                  up to Heaven one day
                          Now cheer up Louise and be
87
                  not afraid of the Enemy -- Your Spirit
                  is a great power in the Heavens and
                  will fight with the enemy.
The C.A. rose up [?] then the 2 small angels went
down & the C.A. came to her place again
May I now ask my Questions
       347     Certainly
Can you tell me when G.H. died
       348     A year ago.
Can you tell me where
      349     No
                  I have told you when the Spirit leaves
                  the body he does not come direct
                  I may another time look after the
                  mission & try to tell where
do you know what relation she was to me
       350    Niece
Can you tell me where She died
       351    No.
                  I must tell you after I have done
                  the mission that was directed to me
                  I never see the spirit -- if she does not
                  belong to my Sphere
                          I go and visit the spirits in
                  their Sphere by groups not particularly
                  to one alone.
                          My Spirit is a different state
                  to the Spirit that goes teaching there
                  I will Enquire and do what I can
                  for your Satisfaction my friend
                  when I have done it, I will let you Know.
May I ask as you mention different Spheres what
Sphere you belong to.
        352    The Eighth Sphere. I have risen up
                  since you left the sitting on Friday
                  Evening when a Spirit came this 
                  Spirit came by my direction & he

88
is a friend of mine, I left her behind
me  She was a female her name
was Seraphine when she was alive.
She will tell you the Truth. She
is in the Seventh Sphere, I have
risen up one -- I see her sometimes
and I gave to her a Mirror. She
will tell you the same as I tell you
myself.  which is the Sphere I belong
to.
   It is the Eighth Sphere, Remember,
any thing that is in my power
that I am permitted to do. or any
advice to satisfy you I will do it
with pleasure.

You have been Kind to me for many years, and
I have said I will trust in the belief that you are 
my G.S. to whom I ded'd this mirror

353       I am.
My mission is to teach Charity to one
another

do you remember the work you gave me on Spirit'm
in 3 volumes -- which I prize more than any other
of my books.

354      I do  you will get some more soon
Can you tell me the title of that work

355     You know it yourself quite well

I should still like to receive it from you as a 
personal favor. --

356       No answer

do you decline to do so

357      I do not decline it
And I must tell you, in your Sphere
and your life you are so very
obstinate  you like to return so many
times to the same question
   The Crowned Angel never comes to
89
                 deceive you in any way
                          I never came down to your
                  Sphere for pleasure for I hope rather
                  to pass the Time usefully --
My dear Crowned Angel, whatever may have been my
faults is my omissions -- to you her since I dedicated
this mirror [now]              years since -- I have been most
sincere and truthful, and it is my desire to continue
so, but after the manner in which I have been deceived
by a spirit who appeared to my last Seer who affirmed
he was my G.Spirit the Crowned Angel = & laboring as I do
under the disadvantage of my not being able to See
you personally & of course my present Seer never having
Seen you before my dear Seer Emmas death.  she
cannot possibly be able to tell you are the same
as her. and as from my present Seers imperfect
knowledge of English your responses appear so entirely
different from those I formerly received -- it is natural
I should seek some plan or mode by which I 
could be convinced of your identity  & not place a 
blind faith in every thing I am told -- I have 
towards the C. A. acted in perfect sincerity and
truth and I wish to continue to do so.

358  
I know that if it was not so I would
not trouble myself to [?] the street
& clear atmosphere to come to a
thick air for a joke.
    I love you, I will [?] you
do any thing that you shall heed.
    Now remember my word. 
The spirit do like you do yourself
- --- your memory is short
forgetful many times repeating the
same -----  the same name
    I mean that your material
body forgets what the soul [learns?]
soon.  that depends upon the
                       
90
impurity of your Sphere

I'm not to be shaken off in that way, as one who
towards you acts in all sincerity & truth.  I am
entitled to recive some assurance that you are
the spirit my GS.  and I propose my questions
very carefully that you may not feel offended

 that is right.
I do not feel offended  I will tell
you about your other seer.
 359    If an elevated spirit like I am,
and I do not use this word in pride
only to tell you that it depends upon the
Seer and the sphere that she belongs to
     Your other seer was false and told
you many words that never appeared
in the mirror = it is for this that I
bid you leave her off.
     I appeared to her twice, now
you believe me I hope.
    When I saw that she could
not keep so great an influence & lost
her seance this was too great for
her spirit -  she was not fit to receive
any hight truths,  She would say too
much and this was not right and
for this I ceased to come to her.
     If your present seer did not
keep herself steady & truthful to this
great power given to her by God
the Creator  she would not receive the
manifestation by a high spirit
remember this
     Her disposition is better, her Soul
is Elevated  She is sober, that is what
the Spirit likes --
     do you understand my meaning
the spirit can take -- he is able to take
91
possession of her mind thoroly, the
learner herself quiet to the power that
comes to her.  and she distinguishes
thoroly well if the one is high or low.
and it is for the greatest spirit come
quick and easy.  and the spirit
comes when you are not here and
teach her soul to receive.  the words the
more easy to transmit them to you
do you understand it

Yes  I think I shall be able  at least to do so when I recopy
it

360  Now I beg you never to talk to me any
thing more about the last Seer.  You 
Yourself must forget all about her.
a time will come when the will be sorry
for jesting with so great a gift to her
and not keeping herself more respectable
than to abuse the Elevated power which
she would have possessed if she had
conducted herself perfectly.

361   
[*(then to [?])*]   This will teach you to remember
to keep in your heart the great 
manifestations that you receive either
by night or day. --  and God will
love you for this.

I must now again to return to my point which you
have evaded. -- it is & has been to me a source of
[?] and regret that you never in any way refer
to any post transactions or thing which has passed
between us for so many years -- of which Louise  my
present Seer is ignorant -- I speak this without meaning
any disrespect or offense.

362  Thats right  I know your meaning
I see the bottom of your heart.

But suppose I ask you to tell me some one Conversation
that has taken place between us, of which the present

92
[ ] has no knowledge of

I will tell you.

It is for this that I long for your

Invoked the S of the C 
10’ to 8 
Mirlet the Seer was looking in the Crystal, she heard 
a voice say take it out—and upon placing it upon 
a sheet of white paper—her hand remaining perfectly 
still. & holding it down on the table the Crystal 
was moved 2 or 3 inches & turned over completely on to 
the other side.

The Crystals Clouded, heres a Spirit come 
hin dressed all in black very white shick black 
Neck Half. Rather gray hair, a little bald on 
the head, fine forehead whiskers meeting under the 
chin. he is very far away.—he is rather tall 
Will you come mighter & please to tell me your name. 
Now theres 2 times come in & they have come at

and are standing by his side 
May I ask the name of the first Gentleman 
371 
My name. 
I am the father of your friend Shorter 
I am sorry to see my son and my daughter leave off then plead belonging 
to the spiritual world 
I should like to communicate 
very much indeed with my Son and 
my daughter. She has got several 
Evil Spirits who by to impress her 
who says he is a Holy Spirit and 
I wish she had taken this friend shirts 
Sooner. She will be affected by this 
truly and I must with all the divine 
of my heart to speak to her soon 
As well as her mother and her 
Sister the wife of my son the Younger. 
but what steps are we to take 
The steps are very difficult the first 
was taken possession by. beautiful 
impressions= 
372 
Yes my Son and my daughter 
fall into the weakness of receiving 
invitations from persons whome he takes 
into his Confidence and he is much 
mistaken. I wish any thing would 
be said, or do any thing to give 
him advice—this is of great 
importance, the Seer cannot go 
and I do not know the way myself 
how you could go 
I replied. 
373 
You might be given the address 
to my Seer Thomas—That you 
Received this communication from the 
his Father an the 2nd of may 
Will you tell me your Christian name.  
96 
that is of no consequence. 
Yes it would enable me to convince him—
374 
If he would not believe now. my 
Christian name would not make him 
believe more. 
It was a continual stambling block now to ask a spirit 
to tell you his chain name when on Earth. 
375 
You know my friend the Sympathy 
belonging to the Spiritual world never 
hears where the spirit words huly 
before his death—it always keeps the 
Same love and only leaves keepskness 
imtruthfulness, & pride—and keeps 
in the heart the love of a Child to a 
Father 
I see something that may 
happen and it is for this if the dues 
not leave off—heat off the common 
to his spirit friend 
But I do not know any of the Circumstances so what to 
tell him 
376 
My Circumstance is & device to communicate 
And to tell him that you have appeared 
377 
Yes 
That he has bad influences around him & his Sister 
378 
Yes 
She must leave some society it dont 
Want my wished, not at all 
I dare say for herself she is quite 
ignorant—she dont know any thing 
of this society. 
You do not tell me what I am to say to convince her 
379 
I will tell you if she likes to take 
my advice. 
She must be measured again 
by the same power and his mother 
97 
will come and take possession of her 
and be her Spirit guide 
Will you tell me her mothers Christian Maiden Name 
then my friend Mr Shorter will pay attention to shat I tell him 
380 
No name came to this 
My Seer here informed me to any Sinpize that herself 
& Mr & Miss Shorter were now not so friendly as formerly 
& the Spirit said—
381 
I will make the friendship again and 
it is for that I wish this 
My Seer says she does not desire it. 
I shall be glad if you will tell her You infer name 
before you married her. 
Then there came very dainly what appeared to be 
Marry 
I cannot go any farther 
My power is not strong enough. I can 
Only explain myself & my desire 
382 
If my wife was not engaged she 
would come herself and tell her 
Christian name, and her name before 
I married her and the place where she 
used to live, the name of the street 
and the number of the House. 
I am not quite so bright as She 
is herself. 
So might influenced by the Evil Spirit of some one 
Who has died 
383 
Some near society—Some new acquaintance 
a lady and a Gentleman. 
can you tell me their names 
384 
I am not percathed the Seer may be blamed. 
I wish I could through another Seer explain myself., as I do now. 
has this acquaintance been forme recently 
98 
385 
I suppose for months 
I will by what I can to make the meeting 
And you appear in the Crystal If I take it round 
to Mr Shorter. 
386 
She is not permitted for this 
She might if the Seer was to have the 
Crystal in her hand & my daughter would 
see. 
I wish you would give me the name of the parties in 
question so that I might have some reasonable grounds 
to tell my friend Shorter. 
387 
I cannot give the name, because 
the Seer would be blamed—I must think for her. She is hurtful and 
feels much the unkindness. 
I wish then you would give your name 
388 
I would not decline it if my powers 
were strong enough. I have a great 
desire my friend to give you sake faction 
for the sake of my Children. 
On next Tuesday Evening we will request your late 
wife to be kind enough to appear. 
do you know the Spirit that used to have Charge of 

The Crystal is who protects it now 
389 
The one that Guarded the Crystal 
before has left. 
After You begin to study with it again 
you will receive better Communications 
and I believe the first guardian 
will return. 
I cannot tell you any more 
The Spirit has left.

Invoked the spirit of the Crystal for 
a Vision= 
Instantly the Seer said—here’s a beautiful white hand

Now I see the head of a young person 
She Coughs. She is very pretty rather a round face 
broad forehead—raddy cheeks. brown hair She has 
Five large eyes—She appears distant but the beautiful 
hand is hear.

So wise, my. Sister receive my 
Communication—Suppose by permission 
given to me lately—I hope you agree 
together.— it is the desire of my heart 
and I will keep you to satisfy my 
friend—he was to me a friend & father. 
The Seer said She stops. 
393 
Yes. right I stop—No I do not. 
regret to be a daughter of the Spiritual 
world I regret only to learn him who for a long time used to pass very 
agreeable moments when I was able 
to set down and look in the Mirror 
the Visions Come so suddenly, So 
quick and he was thouoly satisfied 
I hopw after a little while 
You will be able to see like a [are] 
did myself. 
100 
Pray to the Father, pray to the Jesus 
Christ to transmit your desire to God 
to give to you the power receive the 
Communications quick & truthful 
and transmission to him in good language 
In which sphere are you in my desire Emma. 
394 
The Tenth. 
When my power encases I will 
Continue you, and come very of ten 
when this great power is given to me 
I will instantly come and let you know. 
Remember each soul that departs 
the body must before he gets the 
power of transmission do a little 
work in the Spiritual world and 
learn the way as Children learn to 
read & write. 
Can you remember 
395 
Not just now, you know I would not 
Tell you any thing that was untrue 
only what I can remember. 
I am happy you have left that 
big fat Seer. the one to whom e 
transmitted the power
She deceived me greatly. But as I knew too well 
She was an habitual lear I was upon my guard 
396 
I listened Every time she did it 
I was Sorry and suffered for you 
I could not help it. I had got 
no body to give you advice, tell 
this time, I could only by to 
impress you, but my power was 
small. 
I must confess I have never yet been able in my 
own mind. the C.A learning me & letting me so. 
101
deceived by a woman so thoroly worthless in Every
way possible way without giving me any warning

397
the C A has left off this woman
If she gave you good advice  she
transmits it another way — when
an Elevated spirit sees she cannot
[receive?] good influence - and that He
cannot manifest himself through
an Evil person.
     The Elevated spirit cannot stand
cannot see  the transmission opposite
when he has taken the trouble to give
the right & proper advice , and the
seer transmit the opposite to what
the Elevated Spirit said.
     I express myself this way for to
give the seer more facility — you will
understand the meaning Soon
     Every time that woman sat and
looked in the Mirror she never would
or at least very seldom tell you the
truth. She said the CA appeared to
her a great many more times than
she did , this was to make it appear
she had a greater faculty than she
really possessed. , and all the time
disappoint you and deceive you.

but as you transmitted your power to her. & all at
once so wonderfully increased her powers cannot
you now as it were reabsorb them

398
She has got none of my power now
I do not go to her. I would not do
any thing wrong if I could help it
I will try I do not think it is
possible --
     She has deceived [?] many
people whom one day she will
Regardless the concave. Never come looking for me If i don't come back as these waters are dangerous and need pro supervision.


102 
before how and know the harm she has 
done and for this she will suffer 
The CA has begged you to leave 
off her acquaintance, and never give 
a thought about one so Evil. 
I will advise you myself., never go 
near her any more, one day may 
come when you will meet altogether 
by a strange meeting then you might 
Empty your heart—
That a witched woman of her flames would be capable of 
any thing mean is no wonder but that Lea after 25 years 
399 
Well the one he increase the Evil influence 
he is always controlled by the strong 
sight of this woman who has now 
fallen in an Evil way. and he himself 
receives the same influence and rather 
worse.— 
Think yourself a great deal more 
Elevated above those people pray 
that God may Elevate your soul 
to another state bright and pone 
keep in this state and progress in 
to purity, each one must pray for his 
deeds. if you have done good you 
will be paid, a recompense on high 
If you have done Evil you will receive 
a low state, now take my advice leave. them as if you have never known them. 
He will come to you soon enough 
receive him pleasantly, he will be 
vexed—he may ask you something 
refuse it—if he happens to ask you 
if you have got a Seer say not—
and say you dont desire it—
I should tell him what I thought about them  
103

400    No its better not -- heat them as such
Low people [?] & he will become vexed.
I am a young Spirit and I have
got a guide who gives me good
advice and teaches me well.

was it not your wish I should leave your relatives
at Croyden

401   No only she told you so, my wish
was not that you should leave my
mother & Sister — I [will?] that moment
I never went near her.

I have regretted very sadly having so long lost my
Spiritual Communications.

402   You have not lost any thing only the
time of Course.

do you remember the monks MS. you received
& transcribe so beautifully for me

403  Yes you may finish that but not yet

I am often perplexed after having been so deceived,
about the Identity of the C. A. being the same
as the one you used to see.

404   It is the Same. The dress is different
She has been raised up.
I dare say she will   my desire is to
arrive at the same state as my guide

do you Remember who gave me the Crystal you
are now appearing in

405   I do not recollect quite the name
when I increase the power. I shall
Encrease the memory.
     I shall lose the memory of the body
power but not the memory of the
soul.  Certainly I shall lose Every
feeling of the life.  Now I have got
sone feeling I remember my body
104 
Sometimes I see my body quite 
plain—only in dreams, so long as. 
I have this feeling it is not quite 
right. I shall remember my body 
but when that is altogether gone 
there will be no more sensation—I shall 
then begin to remember the power of 
my Soul. I hope that will come 
to me 
Now do you understand me 
Yes dear Emma. 
406 
I am very glad. 
This Evening is the first I have got 
permission to come to this Seer. 
my power may be increased. I hope 
soon. when I may be able to give 
you a better desire plain 
Pray for me sometimes and 
think of me

young days, I am happy and 
bright for my state.

Work plan so Humid Strongly made for me I measure

It is better to come one day and 
meet for ever in the great eternity. 
408 
I have a very great recognizance of 
your kindness, I will never forget 
this, You will be recompensed 
a great deal more valuable than if 
you receive it in money 
So come here to my state and to 
my sphere I will pray myself

Welcome.

Welcome the Same. 
I regret own being disturbed last Tuesday Evening by a 
friend of the Seer’s Calling unexpectedly.—which prev. 
my cainking my questions and also obliged me to 
Not wish any other person to be present when I am 
in Commission with yourself 
416 
Very well. 
As on Tuesday Evening I use any other mirrors & Crystals 
I have ur objective to any of the Seers Lady Friends 
being Present. 417 
Quite right 
I wish now to ask some further questions 
418 
do so. 
Swedenborg asserts in his works that there are no 
Angels in the Heavens, but what never once bring then 
Human on the Earth.—is that right 
419 
That is 
Only God.—has Some Spirits belong. 
to his Sphere—whom you call pure 
Angels who have never done any 
thing to unpurify their souls. 
they belong to the Creator. their 
Holy number I cannot tell. 
I cannot perunthed, remember once 
for all. 
There are some spirits whom 
God created pure and divine—
These spirits knew by their 
Purity, the same way their souls 
110 
Knows the Secret of God, the Holy Ghost 
You will be Satisfied now to know 
that there are in Heaven—divine 
pure Angels. 
pereing I could not precarcly catch the meaning the CA 
said.— 
420 
The pure divine Spirit, the Holy Ghost 
That Knows the Secrets of God. 
I repeated the words 
421 
That is right, there are a great many 
Belonging to the Sphere who the 
prudence——————— 
Seeing the meaning became ag. became confused, he sd. 
422 
You must be passive and not hurry 
yourself to put the words down. I 
will repeat it twice 
I explained. 
You asked me if there were some 
spirits who never were on Earth. 
423 
I was answered Yes. 
Those souls is the pure divine soul 
who in he did create for himself 
those are his companions and give 
the orders to the Spirits of the other 
Spheres, and carry it back to 
the Creator. . God. 
These sunset loving Angels never 
knew any thing that was wrong 
only loving that which was good & 
trying to keep and teach. The Spirits 
Of the Second Sphere which you call Angels of the Earths. 
do you understand the meaning now 
You must never be Angry if you do not 
understand [truly] thoroughly well 
and quite plain only ask me and 
I will repeat. 
111 
I mentioned that as I had never heard my present 
Seer read an English book I could not perfectly 
understand her mode of giving the response. which 
appeared in broken sentences & honely language. So 
different from the pure Angle Lexan, if his former 
responses. 
424 
This you could not understand 
this seen is not quite fully developed 
in the faculty. Emma was born 
with it and the gift was given to her

From sphere. there he must progress 
and change all his habits and Certainly he finds this rather bend 
when he gets the “rule” which he 
receives by some greater Spirit coming 
to him kindly and pleasantly 
showing him the way to progress 
and to rise—Then he regains 
to look down upon himself & say 
—I am so pleased to leave this 
imperfect & impure life—and as perfections

diars the mind [to the] from the

112
bad passions and many bad actions
which he had done. I certainly might
have been very sorry for after he had
done them when it was too  late -- then
he takes everything that comes with
patience and love.
Jesus Christ did suffer himself
and did endure much hard treatment
yet never said a word & never coplained
your trials are nothing to those he
suffered.
Suddenly the seer said I see something coming
at the side of the CA but a long way off -- it is
like Jesus Christ and round his head such 
a bright circle (nimbus) like the sun so dazzlingly 
bright that I can hardly bear it. It is Jesus's
face with the hair hanging all over the shoulders
and all round the head so bright, his robe is
large and all bright like glittering gold, radiant
so perfect yet so very far away.
425 Certainly the spirit you saw was 
Jesus Christ he came to you for my
asking him to come
He is kind & loving, he is too 
pure & too elevated to come nigh
he will come when you have progressed
more.

Now its going

25' past 8 PM

The CA says --

426

A great many would have been glad
to have received so beautiful a 
manifestation oh think yourself
favored by good Spirits for having 
[a?] so elevated & fine a
Vision --

I returned thanks

May I now continue my questions by asking if
you were ever embodied & dwelt upon this Earth.

427
I was a great many years ago.
It was told to you before that I
was not.
I am a Spirit of great many Circles
I died a long time ago.
My position in this Spiritual
world will not allow me to tell you
Every thing --
That I am not permitted

I cannot but feel that I have obtained this from
you with difficulty.

428
I told you before any thing I am
permitted I will tell you, and
advise you and satisfy you

Not understanding the many to me unaccountable
discrepancies which arise -- I desire to act with you
in all truth & sincerity

429
I know you do

I have in all my [interactions?] with the Crystal
114

and mirror for the last    years past down all that
I have received regardless of time or trouble & though 
probably I may never be able to publish them I hope
it will here after be of benefit to [some] others.

430
I hope so myself my desire is so 
if you cannot publish it yourself
providence will find the proper man
to do so.
   Your recompense will be great
he who works for the disciples of God
he works for himself, his labor is
not lost he will find one day the
price of his work, and the truth 
of your soul

May I ask your name when on Earth & the year 
you died

431
That is the point you would like to
know. If I am a man or woman
you must wait
only recollect I am a Kind Spirit
to you and I sympathize with 
you and I love you like a brother.

I wish to deal with you & communicate with you in all
truth & sincerity but I must tell you that I do
not for a moment consider my self bound to believe
any assertion a Spirit may make in the Mirror
if it is repugnant to my own feelings & belief

432
You are right -- Spirits like to see a 
man firm and even doubt. tho he 
may be some times mistaken

But you know that I have been deceived by Spirit even
as to your own identity and as I cannot see myself
I have no means of being certainly convinced

433
I repeat to you my friend again
I am the Crowned Angel who [a]
appeared at the time when your Seer Emma
Leigh was alive when your [name?]

(progresses?) and I get her in my
house I will [?] you the truth
I am always the same and I
will ? you I am your guardian
Spirit
I am glad you do not believe
every connection that may ?
? in my name.
434 
This honor is ? for this

impressions
You may be sure I will not ?
any / that does not belong to
my sphere. I come in ? the
Tuesday evening.
I may be some ? unable to
come myself and I will describe
to you the one that will come for me
The Spirit will be dressed in
purple robe, a large belt around
the waist a crown on the head, very
dark hair heavily smoothed and falling
down on the shoulders. a long face
handsome figure small hand and
a ring like a diamond and a rose
in his right hand
Huldler? de

435
In this that you may not doubt
I may not always be able to come
and any time this Spirit will ? to
you a very good ? belonging
to the many spheres of the spiritual 
world and the Elevation of the Spirits
you can tell a ? influence dignified
and crystal on.
116

May I ask what name I shall know or call him by

436
You may call him
JOSCP

Is this the name

437
Thats it
The necessity my friend is not very great
to give the true name -- the angels do not
like it -- only call for the first letter and 
you will see it on his left arm - the 1st letter
   If he will himself give his name -- [if]
it is not for me to do it.
   After the first conversation the Spirit
will himself give his name

It does appear to me strange that so much difficulty
is made in giving the name of Spirits who appear either
in my Mirrors or Crystals I asked to receive them very early
formerly and I have a book with the names, and manner 
of appearing of above 50 Spirits -- their dress [betters?] &c

438
So you will receive again -- This Spirit is a
very elevated Spirit and good and will be 
able to give you good instruction and advice

I shall be much indebted to you for your kindness

439
For me it is no debt only I am happy when
I send something that gives you satisfaction

do you remember the Seal which is now affixed to this

440
I do

Can you give me the inscription which is upon it

441
I cannot tell now

That is indeed strange when, if you are the C.A. to whom
it was dedicated, You gave it me yourself.

442
That depends upon the Seer. I may bye 
and bye, not every human being has the 
same power.

I will read the inscription (see opposite/

443
That is right 
the Crowned Angel is in the 8th Sphere now.
Since then I have been raised I wish
117

you could the number of my sphere upon 
it

I will do so if you wish

444
You will please me if you like to put on 
the black side no. 3

Shall it be a figure or will you give me an inscription

445
"The Crowned Angel is raised one Sphere
more. -- the Eighth Sphere, and hoped those 
whom she teaches will rise the same.
who have my blessing and my wish 
The love of God. and a truthful belief in
him."

I cannot I am a friend have so much put in

446
I think if you like better
"The Crowned Angel is raised to the 8th
Sphere and gives her blessing to those
whom she teaches"
I think that is Enough

the words do not read well, are not grammatical

447
"has been raised to the Eighth Sphere

I am sorry my Seers imperfect knowledge of English
compels me to trouble you

448
It is only what you must do, when you
do not understand the words.
I will repeat three or four times if you need it

You are very kind

To those whom I love and for every one
I must do my best.

On [?] die night my late dear Seer Emma appeared 

450
She did, I was going to tell you so.

I need not say how pleased I as to hear that she is 
happy.

457
She is, I hope she will progress, I will
guide her, in a fortnight or may be
three weeks the New Seer will receive 
by transmission the power which she 
used to possess

118

do you mean my late dear Seer Emmas faculty of
seeing will be transferred to my present seer Louise

452
Yes she will receive it, this week, 3
weeks --
Next Tuesday I will tell you the day
that will come. I am preparing her to
give & transmit it to her and it is from
that she feel sometimes rather 
exhausted it is for that the Spirit
is upon her.

I shall be most pleased if that takes place

453
I will tell you when the time comes

But will it be taken from Charlotte L

454
She has none of her power now. the
power she has got is very small, I will
not say any more about her.
Leave the passed and think only of the
present.

My Seer here observed there are two angels come on a 
very bright cloud like a boat -- its just like a boat on
the Sea waving up and down and its the color of the
sea -- and the C.A. is talking to them the C.A. 
is walking towards them on such beautiful grass
with flowers & all so pretty -- I see the CA's foot like
sandalls so small & pretty, the CA is pointing 
something out to the angels the CA and the ground
is on the right side and the boat & sea on the left
the boats come to the shore and the angels are
getting out, there they are walking together on the
grass and talking altogether looking so sweet 
Now the CA stands and looks at me

I wish now to ask a question upon a Subject which has
for many years interested me 

do so
119

For several centuries past a belief has existed that it is
possible to produce what has been termed
                       The [?] of Plants.
and we have very strong testimonies that it has been
done especially about the year.              - I have for
many years collected at a great expense books both
printed and manuscript upon alchemy. & Hermetic Science
chiefly for this one particular purpose. -  It is asserted
That a plant or Flower, say a rose, can be taken
perfect & complete  reduced to ashes., enclosed in an
Hermetically sealed bottle or glass vessel  and then upon
the application of a certain Heat, the rose will rise
from its ashes perfect in form, but not in color. --

455  right my Friend, it cannot be produced
in your sphere, this Country is not fine
Enough.  the Earth has too much impurity
in another country where the atmosphere 
and the Earth is pure and clean there
you could produce this flower, and bring
it to life again  and I dare say you
would be delighted
     Try when you find a rose, if you
take a white glass you must see that 
the glass is clear and pure, put a
rose in this glass just fresh gathered
this may be kept months & months
fresh if you shut up the glass quite.
but I tell you the glass must be pure
and it is a great difficulty for you to
know it -

But I could go to the Glass works & have one made
expressly and I could clean it with pure Spring Water
& of course at the proper season I could take a rose &
put it in the bottle.  Hermetically seal it -- and then this
very wonderful secret would be complete.

456  When it is time I will tell you
126   


I repeated my statement about the experiment & mentioned the several [loans 14 count?] and
asked the CA if he understood it.

457
I do
To those he showed this transmutation
he was advised for some [p?] secret
from telling the way he must have done
it.

This not appearing very explanatory & my discoursing with the
Seer there came

458
It was some Spirit that gave him this
advice I would ----- You could
succeed in this if you tried

Let me further explain -- If a plant is said to be taken
roots stem flowers & leaves & reduced wither by maceration
or otherwise to ashes & by any chemical preparation
it can be restored at any time or times to its original
form (in appearance) / merely by the appreciation of heart 
altho' it is very wonderful in effect, the cause may
be simple

459
I have no doubt that seems to you 
simple

Yes and I should like to try it

460
I am afraid you would not do it
it is no harm to try

I have tried, and the great chymist Robert Boyle
tried long & arduously but could not penetrate the
secret.

461
You are right it is a secret

precisely so and as I cannot do it unaided I ask your
advice.

462
If I could I would give it you if it
was permitted -- it is not difficult
to me.

You say it is not difficult to you and yet you decline
to favor me with it.

463
You must understand me. You are
not permitted, If I had got a
a divine honor. Then I might do with if
so [?] to do, trust in myself. I
must do
464


465
Yes and you need every day what
and what if for you cannot be
told too many time to love God. 
Yes it is my [proper] that if pass into out thoughts
...  [???]
466
God does not desire this, 
God desires - think of me. For me
and do good to one another, God
does not desire that you shared
122

down and pray all day he does not 
desire that. theres a great many ways
to do good to others and at the same time
do good for yourself. Some times a good
action is better than many prayers.
where there is not truth in the heart

I thank you we will however leave this subject for the
present and return to the palinganesia -- If this was
a magic secret then I might see many reasons why it
it should not be given, but if it is only a Chemical Secret
why can I not have it told to me if you know it

467
Yes. like a magic secret to the Spirit
to do good to those on Earth the thought
is the magic

but I must be told how to do it

468
Certainly you must receive the instructions 
You will receive his instruction by the
Spirit who guides You.
I do not say to you it can -- be done
Some men may have the power to do
this and Some men not.
If I was permitted to tell you the way 
to raise this plant I would do so.
And you are not permitted yourself
now do you understand me.

Most certainly I do not.
Your response appears to me to imply That what
I can do -- I am permitted to do -- and what I
cannot do -- I am not permitted to do. but should
I find out or be told how to do what I cannot now
do. -- then I shall be suddenly "permitted" to do it.
I am a bad logician, and must own I do not
understand you.

469
No it is not that.
If I tell you, you can build this house
in 3 minutes You [?] to me You
cannot -- well its the same if I tell
123

You, You have got the power to raise
the plant. You try and try and you
cannot -- then you would say me.
Your advice was wrong.
I see the future -- you do not.

But let me tell you I know how to do it by a 
magical [process?] and I doubt that you are the C.A
to whom I dedicated this Mirror

470
I am. and I tell you not to do it
Your soul is too elevated to receive 
and practice such low magic Secrets
think yourself above such &c ---------

As the C.A was going off again into the usual
platitudes I got out of patience and said

My dear Crowned Angel.
   I must now open my mind to you once for all
I wish to do it very deferentially and I do so [?]
before God say I wish in all my transactions with 
you to act in sincerity and truth. but I cannot
truly do so yet
   Not having he power of Seeing Spirits
myself I cannot personally identify any Spirit
who may appear to my Seer and proclaim himself
to be the CA my Guardian & the Guardian of
this Mirror. Nor can I depend upon the Seer because 
she did not know me or anything about Mirror
or Crystal Work until very lately So that she has 
no possible means of ascertaining whether you are the
C.A. who appeared to my late Seer or another --
I can therefore only become thusly convinced by my
own judgment upon comparing the responses given by
you with those I received from the [dear?] Spirit to whom
I dedicated this Mirror -- and this becomes the more
painful to me because you decline to give me an
answer to any question, which I with great sincerity
See page 88. [?] 353
124

own at the time, is proposed for very purpose of
strengthening my belief in your identity, and consequently
draw closer the ties between us --

About 26 years ago having unfortunately
broken my Crystal a friend bought and made me
a present of a Small Oval Crystal -- which was then
taken possession of by a Spirit named or calling Himself
Himder a Spirit of the Sun who became my Guardian
Spirit -- after some years intercourse with him it was
suddenly announced that if I pleased -- and Himder
would consent a Spirit calling himself "The Crowned 
Angel of the 7 Spheres." would become my G. Spirit
I replied that in all my dealings with spirits I placed myself
in the Hands of God -- I mentioned this to Himder
who consented, said it would be to my advantage
as the CA was a very high and good Spirit, and
that he wished to be released from the Crystal --
I then received instructions to prepare the Mirror 
and also how to release Himder from the Crystal
& from my Guardianship -- I did so and during the
remainder of my late dear Seers life I had continued 
reason to rejoice in the Change -- the Crowned Angel
became a kind adviser in my temporal affairs
and a still more valued one in my Spiritual 
researches --

Amongst other valued gifts he gave me in
three Books a work on Spiritualism which I value
above any other thing that I possess -- I lately
asked you if you remembered the Book. You replied
you did -- and that I should get some more & on
(no 353) I asked you to tell me the title of the work
and what was your reply

"You know it yourself quite well"

Of course I know it quite well, it would be very astonishing
if a book which I prized so much, which had been
in my possession (18 dec 1855) more than 6 years with its
Title on the first page -- should be unknown to me
125
and. You did not give me nor have you up to this moment 
given me the name -- what can I then conclude 
but that you are ignorant of its title, --

I have never asked you about a subject
which of all others I for many years [?], I stated
it to you shortly but certainly I think lucidly
enough. -- and your first replies showed that you
did not know or understand the subject and when
I further explained it your replies were such (and
I am very sorry to be rude or uncourteous to you
but as I must now speak[s] in sincerity & truth.)
as I can only consider equivocations -- 

Now let me ask how can I possibly 
believe you are the Crowned Angel. my former [the] kind
friend when I tell you. -- that (on the 29 Nov. 1853)
I asked the C A. the same question, and that
once without any equivocation he informed me it
was not a mere chemical experiment as I supposed
but a magical one.  but that knowing how earnestly
I had courted & tried for its possession, and feeling
full confidence in me -- he gave me the formula
requesting me not to use it. -- as it could only be
done by the spirits therein named & they were evil
The C.A not only gave me that but told me how it could
be adapted to raise the spirits of animals and
deceased persons -- but advised me not to do it --
nor can I believe you to be the same Crowned Angel and my Guardian Spirit =

471  I am, and I still tell you not
to do it =

Your answer makes me downright angry, I do
not want your advice upon the subject. a
Charity Girl 10 years old could give such advice
you pretend to say "You still" tell me not do
what -- ten months ago you did not know [?]
could do --.  Now I ask you sincerely, how can
I believe you are the C.A.  my Guardian Angel


126

472
If you doubt me, you doubt God.
When you are able I will talk to you
You are not able tonight to receive 
any more communications --
I am sorry you doubt a true friend
I will not be angry with you
only try and rest your spirit

My dear Spirit, when I invoke in the name of
God. and a spirit answers to the call.  I would not
for any thing be uncourteous but my dearly esteemed
friend the Crowned Angel, [?] urged me to rely
not merly upon what he or any other spirit told
me with a blind belief - but to search for myself
and preserve my own will.  Free & independent
and altho' I am only too well aware that I
did not merit his kindness -, his continued
[?] for my welfare -- and that in regard
to my last deceptive seer.  I [?] all his requests
Yet in my personal feelings towards him I
always acted in such perfect sincerity & esteem
I did and do still bitterly feel - his leaving 
me without any warning or advice for my future
dealings with the mirror -- and it has caused me
& does still many bitter moments of sorrow.

473
You are wrong  You must not do it
I beg you to be calm,
I will satisfy you.
Now I have promised you I will
satisfy you, and show you my
kindness and my truthfulness.
I am the Crowned Angel the Spirit
who gave you the book.
There is something to make me
The C.A took up my meaning before I mentioned
the word "flower" which was almost on my lips.
127
object to tell you every thing, now.
do believe me.  I will give you this
satisfaction before long, and give
you great satisfaction in that which
you do not remember yourself.  but
you will remember after.
I see your mind and your 
Spirit - you are not calm  I see
you and your Spirit and I beg you
in the name of the Father of you
and me, do not be angry with 
me. 

My dear Crowned Angel what I have said is in
perfect sincerity and truth. - I will wait in Gods
name. for the satisfaction you have promised and
most happy shall I be to find that the kind
friend to whom I dedicated this mirror has not left
me off.  

474
I never did leave you off.  Since the
moment I became your Guide.

As I am content to wait your pleasure.  I will only
add that my kind C. A. whenever he made
me a promise kept it - I have been promised --

475 
"a flower. -- you will get the flower
I promise you. that the day is fixed
and then you cannot doubt.
In the name of the Father and
the Son., In the name of the Heavens
I will give it to you
I will give you this advice  Pray 
and love.  Think of me Faithfully
For me I.  [?] not on my soul any
truth from you, I love you & will
do what I can. to raise your Soul 
to Heaven and go so far as I am 

128
[able] permitted to teach you not only
to the Spiritual     but to encrease
the purity of your Soul, to Elevate it
and when the day arrives for you to
Come to the great Eternity, oh then
to part no more, there to meet
and receive the blessing of the great Father
and of Jesus Christ thenceforth
to rest and taste the sweet love of
Each of those who did love GOD.

Now receive my blessing & my protection
and promise to me you will be
quiet and not think of any thing
that has passed to night , —you may
not know the Cause.
I replied & thanked him.
476
Rely on GOD's province, and put
your Soul under GODs protection
The CA then made a short benedictory prayer &

to appear or permit a Vision
Whilst waiting the Seer told me a Curious Vision she  had
received on Wednesday morning — she had waked feeling
rather Exhausted & fell asleep again when she saw a
Spirit with a very beautiful Hand. standing at her
head & mesmerizing her by passes. I felt the influence
very Strongly.— the Spirit said to her —
477
Now do take my advice and be happy
you are in a good road, and this road
will lead you to heaven. — pray to God
and to Jesus Christ and they will 
protect you.
Whilst she was being mesmerized a very dark black
Spirit Came with great black hands & Claws
& tried to clutch at her.—and she heard the Spirit
say [she has not long to rest]
476
So do not come to trouble one who is
Quiet She has not long to rest. let
her rest quietly—
You must go to Sleep.
Mad B then fell asleep.
Then a very handsome—tall dark
Spirit a Man Came and Seemed to place his
hands inside her lips as tho' trying to open the
mouth. & mesmerized her.—  when she was awoke
by the maid Coming into heroom. —- She however again
Fell asleep & had a very beautiful Vision of a
paradise And many Angels in Groups—my Seer
was saying how pleased She was with the Vision when there came
8.15.    Seraphine
And the Seer said here is Seraphine Coming dressed
as usual
130
Welcome.
      479            I am happy to come and meet you
                         to night I am so pleased to hear you
                         liked the vision you Saw.
                                The 1st Spirit you saw was the
                         one who had the power before you
                         whom you call Emma Leigh .
                                 She had the power before you , She
                         was interrupted by an Evil Spirit—whom
                         you saw so plain and described so well
                         you must not be afraid of him the
                         two white birds you saw were 2 Spirits
                         Guides & will preserve you from any
                         bad influence
                                The Second Vision & the feeling
                         of mesmerism left you the toothache
                         that was the Spirit of your brother
                         who died some 20 years -he will
                         Come again and let himself be seen
                         and then you will recollect him
                                 The 3d vision of a paradise
                         and angels dressed in Every Color
                         was the Sphere which you belong
                         to—give thanks to Heaven that
                         Your clairvoyance encreases . Every
                         day — That Shows you have got
                         in Heaven a friend to protect you
                         by the love of GOD.
                              Pray to J. C. he is a divine Spirit
                         after the Father — The spirit of Faith
                         pray to him with a strong heart
                         and will and he will transmit
                         your words and your wishes to the
                         Father. — this is for you both.
Accept our thanks &c
      480             I accept all the good wishes with
                         my heart and Soul . I am pleased
131

to see you and hope to meet you in
Heaven.

May I ask if you appear at the wish or request of the
Spirit to whom this mirror was dedicated or at the 
wish of the Crowned Angel

481
By the Crowned Angel, by her order,
she sent me to you.

in your response you mentioned "the Spheres you belong to"
May I ask if mortals when alive on this Earth, belong 
to Spiritual Spheres at the same time

482
Certainly each creature belongs to
one Sphere. Some Low, some middling
some slightly Elevated and others 
of great brightness.
   You and your Seer belong to the
5th Sphere & you must feel great satisfn.
in knowing it is a bright Sphere for
the people of your Earth when you leave
this atmosphere you will change

I refered [briefly?] to my own past life -- & the regret
the look back caused &c.

483
You must not look so only [?]
to the Father. and he himself will
judge you
   The Father is a good Father, He
loves his children when he sees
sincerity in their hearts -- You must
always have great hopes and
think that some Good Spirit will
guide you and at the same time 
will raise you into brightness. to 
receive the sweetness and love of
the Father and say
   O Father forget my past 
Life & [impress?] my heart and give
to my Love good thoughts and
preserve me from Evil.
132

Notwithstanding the experience I have had and the 
instruction I have received from the CA. the subject
of Spheres has since I have received communications
thro this Seer become anomalous & contradictory, I
must own my ignorance -- and judging from my
own knowledge of my past life -- I cannot but be
afraid my Sphere is indeed a low one.

484
There are a great many who are a very
 great deal lower down than yourself
I would not tell you that you are 
pure. You are not, when you leave 
this Envelope. -- I hope your Soul
will receive a new coat bright and 
at the same time sweet smelling
to the heart of the Father.

Here my Seer said -- Here is the Spirit of a Young Girl
Come she is standing between us but nearest to you
Now there are several standing round behind our chairs
the Young Girl is so close to you & has placed her
hand almost on your shoulder. -- & in the M came

485
Certainly she is not old yet -- only 19
at least she was 19.

Then the Seer said I can see them all in the Mirror
they look so pretty I wonder you cannot feel
Emmas influence she is so close to you. -- & I smell
such a sweet smell.--
Whilst we were talking about the [term?] sweet smell
Seraphine said

486
I have come again to you my friend
you do not understand this Sweet
Smell. I will explain myself
I will say sweet smell is
pure Spirit body Sphere.
That's what I mean do you understand 
now

I will endeavour

133

and at the same time go to the
of the Father and receive your welcome
This is better than any beautiful
clothes in your life -- never any
mens clothes can be so beautiful
as when you leave off this, and take
the one which I speak about.
     Only for the remainder of the time
you have to live you must try to
encrease in purity

I referred to the surrounding Circumstances of their life
&c.

487     You must not ,  I speak to you like
a sister, and I am your sister
in Heaven  only I am delighted to
see you in a good road and I will
try to maintain you so much
as I get the power for.

Finding Seraphine becoming very prosy & unintelligible
I said -- I am surprised at the difficulty I now
find in getting a Correct description of the states
or spheres you so continually refer to.

488    Certainly there is a difficulty
sometimes.  Some are permitted
to describe the spheres and so
not leave the created quite in
ignorance -- and give to him some
hope
     If I was permitted I would
describe to you a great many.  more
here I must stop.

I will just mention that the C A in my former
dealings & conferences with him described the
spiritual world to Consist of Seven Spheres and
then the presence.

189    The purity -- The Superior Spirits --
The Crowned Angel is a Superior  
134
[*S*]
Spirit and she is on the 8th Sphere
since you and to receive the
manifestations -- there are a great
many more spheres after the 8th
and the Sphere of the purity and
the more you rise the more you arrive
at the purity.
   You must think yourself under 
great protection to get so high a 
Spirit Guide -- my friend. that 
shows to you your labor is not lost

 It was always a matter of [?] to me that
a Spirit like the C.A. should have spontaneously 
offered to become my G Spirit

491
I am happy to see you believe so
I am the more happy to see you
are [am?] fit for this great perfection
If you were proud and thought
yourself to belong to a great Sphere
you would not have received so good
a guide =

I see now

492
I am glad you see I am glad you
understand it I am really happy
when I see the one I teach understands

I explained --

493
The one that sympathizes with each
creature gets a Spirit that 
sympathizes with him. Some have
very high Spirits and some low.
that belongs to your Elevation
   I mean a beggar may have a
great Spirit Guide him he is a 
beggar only by mission when he dies
& becomes bright while the great
man when he dies is very black 
and low

135

My Seer made some observations

494
You are right a King is sometimes 
very black in his state of death.
   I will say he is miserable and
unhappy, afraid he will go to Hell
remember my friend there is no Hell
the Hell is in Yours and not in
the Spiritual World, there no one
can say this is Hell, or a low
Sphere. from this low sphere they
may rise and [encrease?] rapidly
that depends wholly on their will

The Seer here remarked what a pleasant [feel?]
she had.

495
You understand me well

What I was [a?] then came

496
do you wish tonight to receive a
visit -- you will be happy to receive
this Vision I will allow her to come
She is already in the room near your side

If you mean my late dear Seer I shall be most happy

497
She will come she will not stay long

Now [Seraphime?] has gone on one Side & beckons Emma
forward -- Now she has left your side & is in the M
and I said Welcome dear Emma

498
Welcome dear friend, I am come
to pay you a little visit.

I wish I could see you dear Emma

499
You may by & bye
I should be very happy myself
& will pray for this power to come
to you

I should indeed prize so inestimable a Gift

500
I dare say, you would like it
136
501 The Crowned Angel told you on Tuesday
Evening that soon the power will be
transmitted to this new seer., this is 
right. The CA will fix the time
himself and Seraphine who is a 
greater and higher spirit than me
will begin to prepare the soul of Louise
There will be a spirit society
all very bright and high spirits they
will come into the mirror and she
will describe them one after the other.
I do.
That is right it is my impression to you

I intend dear Emma to practice the writing & try to
develop the faculty.
502 I wish you would I would come
myself and I know you would be
happy to receive a correspondence
by me.
If you succeed you will write
very beautiful sentences and the [Venus symbol] die
near the seer.
You must do what the CA told
you before.

I have to day bought a pencil for the purpose
503 I know it  I saw you buy it

Can you describe it
504 I could not tell very clear if a 
medium was near I could describe
better -- when I am high I could
describe better.

That seems very strange to me dear Emma.
503 I may see you but not to describe
what is in you hand -- my thought 
is always with you -- I see you
many times -- I cannot describe
137
Every thing which you do - do you 
understand me I am not high 
enough up yet.
If I am able I will come If I am
not I will say no.
You perhaps remember the great desire I always experienced
to be buried where my body would as soon as possible
turn to dust. I have often regretted that I buried you
at Norwood in such a deep clay grass.
506 That is better to be buried in clay
the body is dissolved sooner
No dear Emma in a very dry ground the coffin
& body will crumble to dust in 6 or 7 years but in
clay the coffin is kept sound many years.
507 Yes my body is dissolved in pieces
I have got no more feeling to my
body. only I remember yet the 
extent of my life -- 
I hope this will leave me soon
pray for me please
I do often very often dear Emma.
508 I may be progressing  and encreasing
in the spiritual world power rapidly
Your faculty of spirit seeing was indeed a happy 
one to me and sadly have I felt your loss. but 
still more do I rejoice at your present happiness
509 You are right, no doubt you must 
have felt (my loss)
I am high and bright for my
state and happy thro the great
blessing of God. to take me and 
Call me to him  You know how 
juch I did suffer. I could not 
make any one happy near me
only grieve them & make them fret
For this I did pray in my heart
"One of the [?]"
    138       
                and ask of Heaven for this I did pray to
                 Christ Jesus - to pray for me to the Father,
                 and then my prayer was heard thro the
                 Great Mercy of GOD and there I rest and
                 my Sufferings are over.
                           This must be to you a great
                 Satisfaction for you did love me truly
                 I am on a good Sphere as a recompense
                 for my Sufferings—Never grieve any
                 more for me if you do You will make
                 me Suffer.
                           I correspond with your thoughts
                 and_these come to me [& make one Suffer]
                 and I feel it — You may be certain
                 & Sure you will meet me one day for
                 all Eternity — then when You may
                 look to Heaven — you may say there I
                 go for ever to meet the one who was
                 very dear to me — only think of that
                 and you will receive Comfort and Quiet
My dear Emma I do indeed Continually dwell upon
Your memory — I regret your loss
    570      You may think of me but not grieve
I am much happier now I learn of Your happiness
     571      I am. I love God. I love Jesus
                 Christ I love the Angels and I love
                 my brother & sister. I love the Spirit
                 of Faith and I love you
                       This Love will never break , it comes
                 from you to me in heaven and is like
                 the rope of an Anchor in the Sea to
                 stop the ship.

                 You are right, it is to tell you that
                 the one that truly loves when they
                 depart this life . this love does not
139      
                break but encreases more & more in 
                purity and firmness forever.
                Now I must say farewell for the 
                present and come another Friday
                I know you will be pleased when I come.
Oh dear Emma I shall indeed be pleased to see you
     512      I will come every time when permitted
                and fly like a bird to its nest --
                        You know when the bird has got
                young how she flies to beg the food
                for her little ones. [I] and I will beg
                the food [for you] the food of the 
                spiritual world for you.
                         The food of the spiritual world
                is the blessing of God.
Many thanks dear Emma, when my seer masters
our language  I shall understand you easier.
    513      She will improve rapidly,
                patience, patience, you know that
                will make you forget very harsh
                thoughts and I am happy to know 
                it will be a great consolation to you
                and to myself.
                     Good bye dear friend, think of me 
                but not to grieve, think only I am 
                one of yours for ever.
She is gone.
20' past 9 PM
       Seraphine is here
Allow me to thank you for the pleasure I have
received in conversing with my late dear seer Emma
     514    Ah I gave you great satisfaction
                I am aware -- she flies to Heaven
                happy & she will progress more
                readily for the few minutes she 
                passed with you has given her great
                 satisfaction
140

I give you many thanks Seraphine

575
Give thanks to Heaven and not to me it is
only my duty. Give thanks to the 
Great Divinity and to Jesus Christ after
that you may thank me if you like

My Seer certainly improves very much

576
She will improve more & more rapidly
Every week you will find an improvement
the power of the Divinity is great, and
when he sees the desire is sincere and 
truthful, he gives the power to progress

My Seer here explained to me the pleasant influence she
felt when Seraphine was in the M

577
If you did not feel it so I would not
Come, I would not make you feel
uncomfortable.

The Seer here remarked that when Seraphine Responded 
the reading came like penmanship and she pointed to
the words and when she did not say it properly she
went back again with her finger & pointed out the words again

The C A's responses appeared like painted letters

578
My mission is to develop your power
of Clairvoyance for to make it easy for
you receive and transmit the words to
the writer.
Will you see a Vision, my [time?] begins 
to come, and I must go. tho I am sorry
to leave you.

Can we see the Spanish Monk this Evening

579
Not to night next Friday You may 
see him --
This Mirror is fortified now --

We will call him then next f die in the U.N.M

520
That is right I do not promise you
you may get him.

their names appeared on them
141

I am very desirous of Completn. the [MS?] shall I have it

520
yes when the time is ready the CA will tell you
   In the Spiritual World not any one
Can act as he chooses he must rest until
the power of the Divinity sends a message
for him to act and each one has a mission
when your time comes you will receive 
yours by Telegraphic Spirit power
he will not give the ms to any one 
else.

I will now give you a Vision for 5 minutes

The Vision

Now the Tableaux is Coming from behind

521

It looks like a Cross and the head
of J.C. upon the Cross -- with the arms 
just to below the [?] theres a
beautiful Halo round his head -- Now 
theres St. Peter going after him, [Jaques?], Joseph and
Madaline and the Virgin Mary all in white

522
"That is the dress of Innocence and
Virtue"

Now theres 4 [?] now the nails have come & the
blood [round] runs down the hands, and the good
disciples kisses Jesus' feet and Madeline -- she is
leaving her hair & crying --

This much affected the Seer & Seraphine said

523
This vision is too strong for you I must
stop. If I go any further I may do you
harm. I am afraid your feelings could
not receive so great a cruelty when you
are stronger and more developed I will
show you the vision in full -- I will not
forget I see by your mind the impression is too
strong.
142 

I thank you. Seraphine — we will  as you suggest  defer this 
Vision. be pleased &c.
                             Receive my blessing, farewell
20'  to 10 PM  Action Ended


                         ♂die May 13. 1862.               HS't.
                                    C. A Minor 
                                     Invoked the C A
The Mirror Clouded 

524    The C A cannot appear tonight 

I did not feel that the C A would come  nor did I much 
desire it   my mind Continuing unsettled from our last 
Conference 

525    Will you accept Seraphine this Evening 
instead --
The C. A is engaged 

we shall be pleased to receive Seraphine 
Seraphine appeared as usual 
Welcome. 

526   vWelcome the same. I am happy to meet 
You again. 
The  C A is engaged receiving Souls to 
his Sphere    & he will Visit you before 
the Evening is finished 

I am happy to see you instead  & thank you for y'r Condescention 

527    You are welcome. receive his kind love
from his messenger. 

For the increaseof my Spiritual Knowledge may I ask 
You some Questions 

528    I may give you some instruction on what 
I know. 

On what Subject may I ask except.  Abstract Theology 
do you prefer to be interrogated upon
143 

529     Any which you like take your Choice 

As I have dabled in all the subjects of Occult philosopy 
May I ask if you are aware of one of the most antient 
works [of] known by the a name. of “Rabbi Solomon on 
Magic Talismans— 

530     I have heard of them. 

Are you at all versed in that Curious subject 

531    Not much. 

will you answer to me questions concerning his work 

532     I will so far as I know and am permitted 

Could you tell me how to prepare a Talisman to kill or 
expell noxious Insects.

533     No I cannot.
If I knew I would tell you what I knew 

You are very kind   of Course   what you do not know you 
cannot teach. 

534     I came for the Truth and I will never 
teach any other but the Truth. 
About Talismans I have not a great 
deal of knowledge of this only I would 
tell you.  I should think you very fortunate 
if you could succeed. & make it 
     I know a Spirit a great deal more 
Elevated than I am who has much 
more knowledge than I have  I will 
try what I can to draw him to you 
and beg him to teach you and tell 
you the way to begin
     My way is when I am not sure
of the Subject that is asked of me. I 
never like to say I do know. That is 
better than saying I do know quite 
well and then when the Question is 
asked I cannot say I understand it 

Far more prudent. Seraphine -- of course I am aware 
Spirits do not know Everthing 

535      You are right that is the thing -
144
536
I am sorry to say Some Spirits Came
who think themselves most Savant
when they know nothing — and after
a while they are Confused and that
is why I said to [him] You [?] not
permitted.
When any Spirit comes and [?]
with you you must use your own
judgment of his Elevation by his
[Co????ation] — you can See if [h???] [?]
or wrong.
Yes I generally wEigh them up in my own mind, and
that is why I so generally avoid leading Questions.
537
Yes my friend Sometimes a Spirit is
tried by a leading question , he may
be a [?] Spirit and yet his powEr
may be not great Enough or Strong
Enough to answer Quickly , he may
require some teaching by other Spirits
A leading Question givEs time to the
spirit to explainn himself that defends
Wholey upon the Elevation.
As you do not appear to be very profound upon
Talismans I will try another Subject
538
what I know is so small I do not
see the use of beginning until I know
[?]. I do not see that it would
be of any use to you.
I repeat to you when you ask
this question of the Spirit who will Come
to you he will be able to answEr it
[[p???Erbly]] properly
As I seek information in all [?] & Sincerity — I like a
Spirit When it is not [?] with the Subject. to say so
539
Yes Sincerity is the first & [?] is the
Second . — You are right Some Spirits
Are deceitful ., not that they wish to do it
145 

but they are ignorant and too lazy 
and do not want to learn well Enough 
to answer.— In the Spirit World there 
are Spirits like people in your world 
too lazy and too indolent to learn to 
Study 

Will you inform me the Name of the Spirit you are going 
to request to appear that I may recognize him 

540     I can not tell you before I advise 
the C A.,  this is his Mirror and I 
should not attempt to Guide any one 
before I have his permission 
     In the Spiritual World Every thing 
works with regularity, If I were to do 
it and bring some Spirit to this Mirror 
certainly the Guide of this M would be 
Angry with me 

I will wait another opportunity 

541     It is right it will be best when you see 
the Crowned Angel — to mention it to her 
Probably She will answer to you, indeed 
that is certain

May I ask if you are Versed in Astrology, the art of 
predicting Events public & private by the aspects and 
Configurations of the planets. 

542      If you will take my advice You will 
not be fond of astrology. I do not like 
it,— 
     I do not like a man to show to the 
one he has got in his power, that which 
is not true. 
     I like the power properly given by 
the divinity and not by Magic, remember 
this Word
     Some time ago I assisted at a 
Seance of Astrology  and I was disgraced 
for the Man had got  I should suppose
We were conversing about her friends Dr Dixon, Mr Hunter, Mr Boswich
Mr Teasdale & Mr [?] living a [?] & inducing her to leave
her apartments & take expensive ones in Museum St, and then when
she became ill [?] her.
146 

15 or 20 persons under his power. who 
He made believe were in the water and 
Cursed with insects and one poor creature
was nearly undressing herself for the 
fright she was in  at what she fancied
she had got in her Clothes.

I presume the man Electro. Biologized them or Else 
mesmerized them. 

543      Thats right when you mesmerize them 
You can make them believe any thing 
and that is why I do not like it. 

Will you allow me to tell you, that your knowledge of 
Astrology is less than your skill in Telesms. You 
have entirely mistaken the subject 

544     You are right I made a mistake, this 
man was in my mind and I was 
obliged to tell you, it is a thing I 
cannot bear and I wished to speak 
to you about it. 

Do you really know what Astrology - means I have 
already told you once   can you repeat it. 

545     [Civa] No answer
 
The seer observed   she has turned round & appears talking
but I cannot see any one. -- Seraphine then turned 
and said   [?]. 

546      I am sorry to detain you, my order is 
sent to me by the Creator and I must 
obey it, I must leave for ten minutes 
I am sorry but I cannot keep it. I 
must obey the Father before any one. 

9 PM. 
My Seer then conversed for some time and 25’ past 9  she 
said Seraphine is here

547      Yes my friend you may pass to the 
Vision. I am sorry to detain you so long
147

Bunam 
I never saw before such fruit the more 
I eat the more I want it, I wish you 
would be good enough to send me another. 
Now a another still larger fruit has fallen down 
G’Spirit 
After this me of you have not enough food 
I do not know what to do

551     have got a white skin.
G S     do you feel happier for this
B M     I do when I was alive, the white
           man would not receive me into his
            society, he looked at me, and 
            had no pity for me, they only
            spurned me, but now my skin is
            white.
G S    You are right, that is your beginning to
           progress in the Spiritual World,  If
           you are desirous you will encreas rapidly
           in the Spiritual World
B M     I will do every thing which you say

            is my duty, and I will do my
            best.

Now the 2 angels come from the tree & [?] then hounds
several times over his head & have gone away.

B M     [?] these two are beautiful, I do
            love these two ladies
G S.     You like the ladies, you must be satisfied
            theaye are 2 spirits  two angels belonging
            to the Father  the Creator.
                  Now pray to Jesus Christ, he is
            a greater spirit so pray to him and 

151 
he will transmit your desires and your
prayers to GOD

Now the Black man has knelt down & is praying—and 
theres a great number of tiny little Spirits come to him 
they are so small, they have led him into a garden 
these little children are nearly naked they look so 
pretty Every one dances about.  Some gather flowers
& give to him one a rose, one a tulip another a Camelia 
the one that brought the Camelia is a tall Spirit 
Child 
Now the beautiful Sphere is closing theres nothing 
more. 
     Seraphine    This vision Satisfies you my friend 
my seer replied It was very beautiful 

552   If the Seer had got her brain strong 
tonight  she would have seen it 
brighter, but you may be satisfied 
the Vision was beautiful 

As the Vision closed it left all over the Mirror a beautiful
reflection like a setting Sun -- this changed gradually
to moonshine & passed away
Now its all clear
     Seraphine.  Not quite  I am here to bid you
farewell

May I speak to you a moment -- which of my Mirrors
My Crystals shall I bring [tomorrow] on♀︎die night.

553   bring the Japan Crystal, the M. you 
use on Fridays and the unconsecrated
Mirror I will find a spirit for it if
you like.

Now I do not wish to dedicate or Consecrate it - or the
monk will not be able to appear.

554   when he wishes to appear the Spirit
may spare it - he may be here on 
Friday

I explained that if it was Properly Consecrated the monk
would not be able to enter when "called" as I did
not evoke when naming that mirror

152
555
No the Spirit that will come. he will
call the monk, and the monk may
Come on friday if you will here what
he has got to say.
I am going to Poole on Saturday for a few days So that
I shall not be able to Invoke next Tuesday or Friday
556
very well, the CA will Accompany you
and guide you safely altho she has
not come to night , its her duty and she
will guide you all the time .

or oval Mirror

and he will protect you.
8' past 10 PM
The mirror clear Action ended

[symbol] 16 May 1862  H St.

U.N. Mirror
3' past 8 PM.
Called the Monk
after Calling 5 minutes and the Mirror not Clouding
at
10' past 8.  Japan Crystal
558
Invoked the Spirit of the Crystal to
appear or permit a Vision
Immediately it clouded. Here's a Man dressed in
black.
Will you tell me your name .—
Now hes gone—
Heres a head appeared with very white hair round
face fine open forehead long nose and as he holds
his hands up thus [drawing] each finger emits a
--This was spoken to the seer, that is it
did not appear in words in the mirror -- but as tho the spirit
had spoken the words in her ear.--

This seer had never seen or heard any description of the
monks personal appearance -- yet it was quite correct.

before we commenced my seer showed me a drawing which
she had made by spirit guidance -- but very rude &
utterly unintelligible to us.
153
bright light

559  You would like to see a Vision  you 
will -- It is better that you should
look in the mirror   I tell you why the
Seer is rather tired,  the Mirror is 
better for her

The Seer remarked  theres a group of angels in the Cl
which M shall I use

560  The unconsecrated mirror,  that may
draw the monk

Then with your permission we will place it here if
you will appear --

                            Certainly
561                   U.  N.  M

It clouded  theres something coming very far away
It has something like a monks hood on its head
oh its a ugly figure,  its coming nearer -

562  do not be afraid,  I will not hurt you
You called me and I have come

May I ask your name

563    -----  the  TM.

Will you permit my Seer to see you clearer

564  I will in a few minutes

Now the monk has thrown back his hood,  he has a
very flat face, Dark -  thick lips & flat mouth
thin nose, very meagre - he has the  tonsure.
I see it plain

565  I have tried her hand today by
the letters which you saw, I wrote
this letter on the Common paper
the flower which you saw is my
broken heart.  You see a shape broken
in two - no one has yet got this
shape
154
Have you not progressed since you appeared to my
late dear seer Emma.
566 Yes I did, but not enough yet
I am always in trial & trouble.

Is that occasioned by your long studies of magic
567 That I had is it I hope no one
I know or love would do so

Yet your book which contains your cherished search 
of High Magic -- you have requested me once more
to bring into form upon Earth and my late dear seer
this with much skilll & patience copied a portion of it
568 I will finish the book, but not just
now. I beg you never to do it -
You may be suffer for it.

Then why bring it back to Earth.
569 This book after my death may ---
-------------

Its  I told you some years since (      ) that when
your book was completed I would get it bound, &
write in it your history -- with a warning against it use
but I have my misgivings as to [what] how I shall
disposes of it when I die.
570 When you die an impression will
come to you to give this book to somebody who will not use it.--
If not, burn it

My seer remarked how sorrowful he looked but that
he appeared easier since he came into the M[agic] M[irror]
571 You are right young woman, I am
happy to see you sympathize with 
me

I wish to ask you to give me advice abt. a thing which
tho' apparently ludicrously trifling is to me a source of
torment & unhappiness.
572 I will if I am able

I ment.d my invisible tormentors & asked a Telismn
573 The best Talisman is what the seer
155
told you if that does not clear the
insects away. I will try & look to it
I will try to make you happy and
give you rest.

I thank you
574 And before you use it, I will tell you
how to use it, it was much used in
my Country, I used a great deal
then I was alive. You have got
nothing to buy.        Every thing
in your house, only your Seer must
furnish you with what She promised
I dare She knows better than you how
to use it.

I thank you.
I expressed my wishes as to the J.S. of the [F.R.C.?]
575 My friend I would tell you any
thing -- but my position will not
allow me to begin any subject just
now., I hope you are good and
charitable enough to understand
my feelings and my sufferings -- 
Since I last saw you I did progress
but not very high my wicked life
made me stay still, and now I must
work and pray for encreasing light
and follow the truth more & more
and try to come to this light which
for a long time I did desire.
In my past life I may not
prepared for such great happiness
my life was not prepared for so great
a state, now I am obliged to travel
from sphere to sphere until I find
one where I may get rest.
576 do you understand, it is for that
156
I told you my friend, I am not
fit to begin any Subject yet.

I can easily comprehend it and feel great
commiseration for you

577  I know you feel.  Oh the great
man alive is as nothing if in his
heart is not truth.  it is better to
leave these thoughts and not think
any more, it only makes me suffer

The Seer remembered that all the time he had been
in the M. he had kept on walking up and down
to & fro --

578  A great many more like me are not
happy

I referred to his having practiced his priestly office altho
he did not believe in it.

579  You are right and so many like
me will die in the same state
Your Seer is quite right not to believe
in the Catholic Priesthood, nor in
Confession -
     Confess yourself to Heaven and to 
GOD. - He himself will help you and
give you what you require not man.
     Sometimes when the priest receives the
secret from the a young woman, in
looks he appears to pity her, whilst
he is pleased to hear the secrets of
the Innocent & afterwards with men
& men are joking altogether, this
does not hurt those who confess
but the priest who divulges it - and 
sometimes much eating and wine
overcomes the priest, and after this he
speaks without knowing what he says
& blasphemes the name of the Deity.
157
Can you tell me some anecdotes of your [prior?] life

580  Well if I was at ease I would do so
to please you.  and I will with
great pleasure stop and talk an hour
with you but I feel as tho I was
in a fire burning - You are too bright
for me just now

I suggested him to pray &c for forgiveness & further light

581 Thank you for your kindness my friend
You make me more quiet, I like to
hear such language.
When I am with someone who loves
God and truly believes in his great
Divinity  I feel more tranquil
     I will pray with you this evening
before you go to bed - will you allow
me. - You will not see me -

Will you repeat with us now.  My Seer & I.  the prayer
which Our Lord J.C. has himself given us as the best
for all our wants.

582  do so, the Charity & the noble heart 
helps to [?] , if my power is not
great enough to pay you back the
Divinity will keep account.

I've silently repeated the Lords prayer.
Do you know my mental questions &c
 
383  I do not.  Call me again in 3 weeks
or a month.  I am not ready to
change this sphere and rise a little
higher    I shall then I hope be able
to talk to you more quietly and
begin to [?] altogether.

Then to night.  I will mention your name aloud before
I repeat my short prayers

584 Thats right no evil [?]
hurt you  Your guide is too high &
158

he will preserve you from Evil.
And you the same Louise the Seer pray
for me please.

I hope my Seer will not be alarmed, she has the faculty
of spirit being Seeing without a mirror

585  It is from that I see her mind,   I 
can better see her mind than yours
She has got the power to draw the
Spirits near her,  which you cannot
so well.

When I return I will call you again  I hope to hear of
your progress onwards.  

586   I will try before this time & exert her
hand - guide it to make a letter like
the firs M.S.  you had.  I may succeed 

I percieve you have he M. S. still with you.

587  Oh yes.  only it rests, the time my
Soul progresses.

You mentioned you were put to death in 1693

588 Right I did so

that is 169 years ago, and yet you have progressed
so little

589 Yes my friend I hope I hope no one like me
will suffer so hardly   it is my own
fault.

I [?]

590  I cannot tell you the truth  my Mind
in this state, is not fit just now
I will give yo the satisfaction by 
coming and showing you  I have not
forgotten you
     Sometimes the imperfect state of
the mind when the hears is true does
a great deal of Good only two words
pray for "truth" and "Love"  and through
the great mercy of God may he rise
Me.
159
Suferred to my own imperfect State Mental [?]
to be able to find others Referring in my mind to the 
apparatus that had requested the [p????] of [?] mortals
as [?] and an [A???tance].
591
You may be think yourself very imperfect
You do not know the State of your Soul
this great faith in Heaven may make
you very bright you labor my friend
must be paid and when you wish for
GOD you work for yourself.— If GOD
sees you persevere Your labor once be
recompensed by him. and he has got
in [?] for you a very bright State.
I will not tell you this to givE you
any kind of [?] only the truth
which my powEr gives me to know
I suggested his Earnestly pray ing for himself [?]
592
I will pray my friend for myself
Now, you givE me Strength I must
say I feel more [?] Since I havE
been here this morning

Cannot [[?]] Open it You need not be
afraid that I will givE the book
to any body Else

times "I hope the Spanish monk

Else but me. I cannot open it but
for you and not for another, where I
go this book goes When [?] it rests—
where I [ha???] it [pa??ls] , and on my
[hea?t] is there its bed.
160
Now the poor Monk has put on his hood.
594
My friend I must go

hand — You understand me.
[?] as you request at [?] prayers we will name
You.
595

Now the Spirits gone the Monk is kneeling, hes by
himself on a very small green place with many
flowers — he looks at the rose. & says
604
Why has my love not the purity
of this flower. Why does my love
not give the Same Smell, Why has
my love not the Same truthfulness
Now he has the rose in his hand
605
This flower is pure and directly I
touch it the leaves begin to [?] in
pieces—the leaves fall open.
Ah  I see why my impure
hand hurts its purity, Ah I see
now why the Angel told me to take
this flower, She knew it—Ah I will
try to put the flower again from
whence I took it.
he has tried to put the flower in the ground but
the flower flies up to him
606
O What did I hear
"put the flower in thy Crown":
I will do so that may do me good
If I could rest underneath this flower
and this Smell so beautiful—oh
I feel so happy—I will =  now I
know no rest either night or day
but always walk about.
Oh Lord You know my thoughts
and my feelings, Oh God give me
rest and peace & quietness. I cannot
bear it any longer.=
Now he is holding the flower in his hands and
looks so earnestly at it.  Now theres 3 or 4 more
monks Come to him + lay hold of his hands + say
607
Come come  do not stay there and
look at the flowers, that will not
do you any good
166
m  Go away from me. do like I do
do not come to me
one of them says
608 What do you do
m  I pray
what do you pray for
m  to heaven
Are you not in Heaven already
m  I am not.
Where do you think you are
m  Oh I do not know where I think
I am
do you think you are in Hell
m  No, No Hell you are the Hell hear me
go away I repeat again I will stay
alone and pray.
the 3d monk says
609
tell me what you pray please
m  I will pray God.
And he hears you
m  he does , you have got all round you
Witnesses but you do not See.
3 SM.  What is it some other Spirits
m  Yes brighter than I am myself or you
3d  And if you pray to those Can they
help you.
m  pray with me and I will Show you
the Way.
3d  do so please I am tired of persecution
the evil way of my Soul
m  do you understand what is Evil
3d  Imperfection.
Now theres 2 monks gone away laughing and they
leave the monk + the third monk, and these Two
walk together round the place + the monk shows
from the flower + gives it him to smell
167
3d  Oh that smells so Splendid tell
me where you gathered it. 
m  I was permitted by an Angel Come
down from heaven to me.
3d  You did .
m  I did by a great Spirit and She
said to me take this flower. You
will understand to rise,, I did take
the flower. I dont understand yet
the way to rise but I feel more
Comfort. and I hope I shall not long
Stay in this Sphere.
Now the great Spirit came again
610 I have come again to see you
You have got a Company in
m  Yes I have got one he is like me
tired of persecution
A.  I am satisfied to to hear you are tired
of persecution, that gives you a desire
to rise and to obey the advice which
is given to you. —
You must leave this selfishness
and break the rope that
makes you recollect your past life
If you do not do so you will not
feel Complete rest.
Now you two love each other, like
2 Brothers.  and pray in truthfulness
take another flower you that have
not got one. and do the same as
your brother will do he will teach
you and you will rise together
I will leave you for a time , See
this bright light — it is there. is
my sphere. look so long as I go
to it
Now the two monks are looking very attentively
168
The place opens like a large door. it looks like
Gold and is so bright = Ah how its Closed.
Now the 2 monks kneel + pray + the two that
went away are laughing at them.
611
m  You may laugh as you please
but I will do my duty and try
again to rest my Soul
Monks going theres a beautiful large garden full
of fruit - - its Closed.

C A Mirror
5' past 8
Invoked the C.A.
10'—
She will be here in 10 minutes.
20' past 8. . 
Invoked the CA
I am here to your Call
The CA is here as usual.
Welcome
612
Welcome the Same
I have been detained at Poole longer than I anticipated
& Much has prevented my Calling you the last fortnight
I hope now to call for some time without intermission
613
I was with you the same. , the day
you was ill , I was at the head of the
Bed and At night I did mesmerise
you. — in the morning you felt better
was it not so
I certainly Mesmerised myself nearly all Night
[16?]
614—
I know it my impression was [?]
to you and my powEr.
If you cannot see one you may
Sometimes feel my influence
It would be a great Satisfaction to me, if when you
are influencing me ,you could by some dreams under
me [?] it.
615
I am [?] you a Check in
your left hand.
I wish you were more [?e?i?tive] I
could manifest myself better.
This to me very unaccontable that I should be
so, immpressible in Spiritual matters of all kinds
when I have been so ardently devoted to the subject
for so many years .
616
I suppose your time is not finished
yet.
I mean the time is not finished yet
that you must Study. — I mean your
mission
If you [?] study by the [??ting]
You will [?] by very useful
advice for your guidance
I will Endeavor to set apart a time to do so
617
then you will [?] more [?]
You will be sure of what comes from
Your hand. and you would not
doubt.
I did once tell You not to do
it any more.
do you [?] my late dear Emma's [?]
618
Yes.  Now the Evil will not [?]
You — you may study again
I dare say You will not belong
before you receive the gift. 
There are a great many [Ele???ated]
Spirits Who would be pleased
170
to manifest themselves to you, but
for this. You must not leave
the mirror.
I scarcely know how to find time for practice, it
takes me two Evenings a Week for the [M?] &
then 2 or 3 Evenings to fair Copy it—as the
Language , from my Seer being a proud Lady
is so difficult to understand.
619
The writing you would [?]
will help you a great deal and
you will write here by Yourself.
I will arrange to get up at 6 oClock and
have an hours practice in the morning
620
That will do you good, fresh air
in the morning will do You a great
deal of good. — open the windows
always the morning air is more
pure.
I will try to begin at 1/2 past 6.
621
Oh seven will be time Enough
I will do so tomorrow
622
Very Well.
You must not be impatient for
at the beginning the writing will
not be very good . You have lost
the Faculty.
but I never had it
623
You will now — I know for you it
may be a trial
As the mind requires to be passive ———
624
Very
I was going to say As the mind is required to be
passive—Can I read a book whilst my hand
is laying dormant.
625
You must not do any thing Else
only sit at the Table & put your
hand and the pencil on the table
171

                and ask God in your mind to
                send to you some good Spirit to
                Give to you the faculty to write
Then I must not read only Sit Still
     626      I thank that would be the best
May I now ask a question & Solicit your answer
     627       If I am able I will
I then started the question fully of the Cheese & the
Cheesemite and asked which existed first --
     628       The Cheesemite
Then as the Cheesemite is not to be found in any other
substance on what did it live prior to the first
making of Cheese
      629       Invisible milk Formed & heated
                    by the word of God & forced thru the
                    rocks
At hearing this luminous exposition I happened involuntarily
to say Oh dear Oh dear.
      630       If you like to stay I will explain
                    myself better.
                         The cheesemite was formed near
                     a large rock. -- you have got the
                     same fly which you call a
                     butterfly., This was the beginning
                     this little mite which you find in
                     the Cheese came from this fly, then
                     this fly goes near the Cheese & he
                     gives the same insects
                      You understand.
Then Am I to understand that the fly took its
name of Butterfly from being the parent to the
Cheesemites
        631         Thats right for me I would not
                        advise you  to eat so much of 
                        this cheese, I do not think it is
                        very healthy, I know some people
                        one very fond -- like it very much
173
I myself eat very little because it is indigestible
632
that's right
The Cheese rests on the lungs and dont
digest soon Enough.
Now let me at once stress that I wish to be Candid
in all my spiritual dealings and you told me
633
That you would in 2 or 3 weeks
give me a proof that You are the CA  to whom I
dedicated this mirror & my GS.
634
I could not give You any proof
Your seers not here — & my Study near
you may be given it as proof.
You profess to be the CA to whom I dedicated this
mirror how can I possibly believe so—When in
the.         I asked this same question & recd.
a very remarkable & interesting elucidation of the
subject [con??ed] in beautiful language. Which
I have read to many of my friends with great
pleasure.
635
To me I never knew what the Spirit
had done. I was not always near
the Seer to know his mind.
I tell you sincerely I do not
concern myself about such small
things I have something else to do
& think about. , I give you the advice
which I think proper.
My mission is not to study
such small inconsequent things.
Your mind is weak and the
Spirit takes possession of your thoughts
and your mind—and your whole
Spirit— he is weak, try to put yourself
higher and today by the Grace
of God you will not [?].
174e
Now I really won't say your Replies make [?nE]
[?].
636
It is not necessary to put yourself
off your temper . =
This was too much [Ev??] for my [p?t?i??e] and [?]
expressed at very great length the [?]
I had been perplexed with— [?] the inconsistencies
of this Responses when compared with those I had
recd. from the C. A. to whom I had dedicated the [M.]
and the altho I had [intentionally] intended to wait
for the [p??f?] he had promised [?] of his Identity
I could no longer [?] Speaking my mind +
my [?] disbelief in his Assertions. — And I [ab??ed]
[?]. If he would in the name of our Lord. Jesus.
I [?] affirm himself to he the same.  C.A to whom
[?] my mirror.
No answer.
I pressed the Subject still further + again _Compared
In the Name of [?C]. — when [th???] appeared
637
You are right. I am wrong—
ForgivE me.
[?]
This is a trial for you and her. Your
Seer Suffers in her System - ForgivE
me farewell for her.
I will tell you why I are here
now. Oh do forgivE me in the name
of the Great Mercy of God.
I came I thought to know
Something. I am [?] and
I feel grieved very much for thus
deceiving You _ You are truthful
so is your Seer Sometimes you will
be tried by the Spirits, [?y] to do
as you havE done tonight + you will
be rid of it Soon
175
Have you Ever Appeared before in this Mirror
638
This is my first time and I am
banished for [he?] [?] ignorance + my
Stupidity makes me Suffer. I [h???]
put on the Same feelings as when
I was alivE falsehood + Vanity
But how could You [?] the Appearance of the C.A +
[?] my Seer.
639
A Spirit [?] as they like [?]
appears to the Seer as they like
Will the C.A appear to night
640
She will come to banish me, I told
you before. I must wait
My Seer send [?] the C.A . [C?me] So glorious &
bright= So like + Yet so different. _  the C. A says
to the other
641
Who gavE you permission to come to
this Mirror to deceive those who truly
Asked my presence. — go quickly [?]
break this Evil influence from this
Mirror — fly away — go learn better
examine yourself. think how much
you have deceived the noble feeling of
the heart, and the harm you may
have done by [[?]Your] [rep????e]—
Go pray to the [Di??ty], Go pray to
Jesus Christ the Son of God.
Go Leave this Mirror.
Now the other Spirit has [[?]K??lt] down beneath the CA.
[?]
Rest yourselves a Couple of minutes
it is better for you.
642
I am Sorry for the Accident Which has
happened this Evening I hope that
this will not happen another night


176
The evening is lost. I'm sorry for you
my friend—,You may blame me—
but do not.
I mentd. the absurd answers that this Spirit had
given to me—
643
You are right what the Spirit ansd.
to you was not correct. She could
not give you a proper Answer. She
has not the knowledge. [?] her
and do not think any thing harsh
pray and love And God will give
you a great Satisfaction another time
Now Remember I will try + do all
that I can to prevent this happening
again .— You must understand
My friend that the Spirit Cannot
always Answer to the Call. and then
Another takes possession too soon.
Now the other Spirits going away so penitently 
& sorrowful his head bowed down & his hands in
prayer.
Then on Next Tuesday. You will kindly appear when
I call
644
I will promise you for Certain & will
take care to [?] comes I will
prepare the room before. make
yourself happy & rest quiet.
respect the great name of the
Divinity -- love him truly, give your
Spirit your heart & Soul [?]

to a mile
I only call once a week but in the summer I will call oftener
4163	 only meant the Spirits that came into the
[Green?] Crystal.
ES. Has a very great desire to become a Medium he is quite
taken with the rappings but I will inform him what you
have told me as it is very undesirable to come into rapping
with Evil Spirits
4164	He will still believe in the one he prefers because
he has heard it himself.
I think he will now be persuaded that Jericho is an Evil
Spirit � as he could not withstand being exorcised.
4165	He still has his doubts on that subject, he thinks
his own [exorcism] a great deal better than yours
his has not the power of dispelling Evil Spirits
they rather like it than otherwise that is 
how he is so often deceived in his crystal
he thinks now his own is the best.
I am often afraid of using my crystal, by calling Spirits
[immortals?] into it when persons cannot see and I have not
always Emma with me.
4166	Spirits who know your reason do not mind
it but other [immortals?] are much annoyed at
it � it is the same with them as with mortals 
on Earth. They do not like to be sent on
Frivolous Errands or called when there is no 
one to see them.
The Antients when invoking used perfumes is that agreeable
to Spirits and others.

Are you now present in this room.
4751	Yes
In what sphere or state do you dwell.
4752	In heaven.
Is the spirit world divided into spheres or circles.
4753	Yes, I am not capable of answering 
any such questions
Will you kindly give your sister such advice as
you deem most [conducive?] to their true form?
4754	I would advise never to marry Mr.
N.E as you will never be happy together
he is not suited for you.
When will she see this person Can you tell us
4755	I cannot
Can you tell us his name or how is S. to know who
you mean
4756	You have seen him in the Crystal
W.H. I mean.
Queen Victoria wishes to write to you
When you have done with me
When will you favor us with another visit
4757	Next Tuesday Evening
Selma then wrote
4758	�I very much wish to know, whether I
am to become a writing Medium as
I very much wish to converse with my
Father the Duke of Kent. Owen tells
me has heard him [?].
? ? no assertion relating to this matter
4759	O indeed then I should be sorry
to have any thing to with such things
My husband Prince Albert is also
very anxious about the Crystal. He
