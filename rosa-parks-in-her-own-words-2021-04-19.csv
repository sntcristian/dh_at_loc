On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks, a 
seamstress and respected citizen of
Montgomery's black community, 
quietly refused to give her bus seat to a
white man. She herself describes the 
episode that triggered the Montgomery
bus boycott and signalled the end of 
segregation in the South. 
""I had been working during the day at
 Montgomery Fair Department Store 
in Montgomery. When I left work that 
evening and came out of the store I 
noticed a Cleveland Avenue bus that 
was quite crowded, and when I got on 
the bus I wanted to be as comfortable as
I could, so I didn't take that bus. I went 
across the street to the drug store and 
purchased one or two items, because I 
had a little pain across my neck and
shoulders from using the press at work. 
As I was coming back across the street to
the bus stop, I noticed another bus approaching,
and I didn't see anybody 
standing up in the back. But by the time I 
did get to the bus door, a number of 
people had gotten on ahead of me, and 
when I got on the Negro section in the
back was well filled, and all of the seats 
were taken. But there was one vacant 
seat in the middle section, that part of 
the bus we could use as long as no white
people wanted the seats. The rule was 
that if the front section filled up and one
white person came to sit in the middle 
section, we would all have to get up and 
stand in the back. A man was sitting next 
to the window, so I took a seat next to 
him. across the aisle from us there were 
two women. I was just thinking of getting 
home and doing my work. 
""Of course, when I got on the bus, I 
noticed the bus driver and recognized 
him as one who several years before, oh, 
I think about 1943, had evicted me from 
the bus because I had refused to put my 
fare in the front and go around to the 
back to get in. That was another rule that 
they had, and sometimes when you got 
around to the back door the driver just 
started the bus and left you behind. On 
the third stop a few white people
boarded the bus, and they took all of the 
designated white seats, and there was 
this one white man standing. The driver 
just turned around and he said he
needed those front seats, which meant 
the ones where we were sitting, in order 
for this man to take a seat. That was 
segregation.
""The four of us would have to stand 
up in order to accommodate this one 
white passenger. When he first spoke, 
didn't any of us move, but then he spoke 
a second time with what I could call a 
threat, because he said ""You all better 
make it light on yourselves and let me 
have those seats."" And at that point the
man sitting next to me by the window 
stood up. The two women stood up and 
moved out into the aisle. I just moved 
my legs for him to pass and moved over 
to the window. The driver looked at me 
and asked me if I was going to stand up. I 
told him no, I wasn't. He said, ""If you 
don't stand up, I'm going to have you 
arrested."" I told him to go on and have 
me arrested. He didn't exchange any 
more words with me. He got off the bus, 
and when he came back he stood in the 
well of the front door and didn't say 
anything, but he was looking towards 
the back. By this time quite a few people 
had left the bus, some of them I guess
didn't want to be inconvenienced and 
probably got off to get other buses, but
there were still several people on the
bus. It was all quiet, and there were no 
arguments or any type of confrontation.
When the policemen got on the bus, the
driver pointed me out and said that he 
needed the seats. He said, ""The other 
ones stood up."" So the policemen approached 
me and asked me if the driver 
hadn't asked me to stand. I said yes. He 
asked ""Why didn't you stand up?"" I said 
I didn't think we should have to. I asked 
him, ""Why do you push us around?"" He
said, ""I don't know, but the law is the 
law, and you are under arrest."" So the 
moment he said I was under arrest, I 
stood up. One picked up my purse, one 
picked up my shopping bag, and we got 
off the bus. They escorted me to the car, 
and I sat down. They had to wait until 
the driver told them whether he would 
swear out a warrant or whether he just 
wanted me off the bus. He wanted to 
swear out a warrant against me. They 
took me on to the city hall, where I was
booked, and from there to the jail. 
""As we were getting in the car, I remember 
asking them if they would give 
me back my purse and things, and they 
handed them to me, and I got in the back 
seat with them. Of course, when I got 
down to the jail, my things were taken 
and held, and I had to go in to the cell. I 
wasn't happy at all; I don't recall being 
extremely frightened, but I felt very 
much annoyed and inconvenienced 
because I had hoped to go home and get 
my dinner, and do whatever else I had to 
do for the evening. But now here I was 
sitting in jail and couldn't get home.

HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE REMEMBERED?

Mrs. Parks: I would like to be remembered as one who has always cared for people. I have more concern for people than material things. I have always wanted to help people. People in need, who are ill, in trouble or need help financially. I have always been very sympathetic for those people who need someone to care.

I asked Mrs. Parks what progress has been made in naming 12th Street, Rosa Parks Blvd.

She said they are still working on it. There was another hearing December 5. She also stated that Louise Tappes was the one who spearheaded this event. She hadn't heard what happened at the hearing.

Mrs. Parks lives at 3201 Virginia Park, with her husband Raymond Parks and her mother, Mrs. Leona McCauly who is 87 years old. Mrs. Parks' Birthday is February 4, 1913, she's 62 years old. She has no sisters, one brother who lives in Southwest Detroit.

I plan to go visit her again during the holiday to take a picture of her, her husband and mother.

Mrs. Parks, 
How are you? It's been some time 
since we have communicated. I do hope
you're well. May God continue to Bless you. 
I'm enclosing  the last page of an interview
that I had with you in December, 1975 - Will 
you please sign it, date it, and return to me
in the enclosed self addressed envelope. I
certainly would appreciate it. If you have a 
recent snap shot of yourself, please send that
also. It would be quite interesting to tell my 
grand kids that I knew you personally and to 
have something to show them. You're a part of 
history and a ""great lady"", and I'm very
proud to know you and had the chance to get 
an interview from you. 
Sincerely, 
Rosa Washington

poor and not rich, meek and not

For the sake of the righteousness
of [our] our cause we must
bow to persecution and reviling, and
again and again turn the stricken

In what way did it shape our city
today?
Ans.  It shaped our city by scaring off many
former tax paying citizens.  Thirty
years later, we can still see the results
of the riots.  Many areas were never 
rebuilt.  When Businesses left, jobs
left, and most people did not have the
money to purchase old structures that
were in need of repair.  Those who
had the money have done well but, not
enough had the money.
a)  Today, our city is growing again but,
only a few citizens are profiting.
Those who have the money to purchase
vacant land, raise structure and
rebuild or repair old structures for use.
b)  That is one of the reasons I [want] wish
to start charter schools.  I would
like [students] youth and parents to
have the skills to get the money to
make their families and our city
economically independent."

How have religions and Faith group helped or hurt the cause of racial
equality in America? It [had] has helped by not being prejudiced against other people.

Is there an area where churches and their leadership could do more for
racial justice?  Yes, if churches and their leadership would [welcome] [welcom]
welcome persons of any race.

Are there links between the rights of women, minorities and gays regarding
treatment by religions.  I have no answer to this question.

What is the message which you hope to convey to America regarding its

There is some progress, since I was arrested on the

Ans.  The riots of 1967 were terrible!
It really did not have to happen.
If the people who provided public
service and consumer service had treated
everybody as they themselves wanted
to be treated, there would not have
been the injustice there was.

and services, eventually, they retaliate

Mr. Al C. Eaton

Los Angeles, CA 90019

Dear Al,

Elaine Steele and I have watched your performance of ""I Am
The Dream,"" more than a dozen times.  Each time we see it, we
enjoy it as much as we did the first time.  You are serious,
funny and motivating.

Each character is different in appearance, experience and
lessons they teach.  My favorite is watching you transform
into Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  You really become him in
your facial expression, your voice and your mannerism.  I
never tire of hearing you sound like him.  I remember his
wisdom, his teaching and his great leadership when I hear
you.

My next favorite is ""Nathan,"" the scholarly nurde.  You are
brilliant.  Your skill in mixing two characters conversing by
drooping your eyes or raising your eyebrow, by making high
pitch stutterings or low sharp slang confrontations, infuses
humor into the history of protest.

Finally, you also sing well.  Music is an important part of 
the African American movement and it complements any
performance.  Students, young and mature learn as much from
the music and singing as from the acting and dialogue.

Al, Elaine and I look forward to your dramatic tributes to
the educational and historical programs of the Rosa and
Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development and The Parks
Legacy through your artistic presentations for many years to 
come.

May God continue to bless you!

Love, Peace and Prosperity

Ans.  It does not appear that the riots
helped race relations at all.
They are just different not necessarily
better.
African Americans have gained a lot
of political power.  We are no longer
taken for granted.  We have had
two Mayors, the first woman president
of a city council, the majority seats
on the city council, Superintendent of
schools, police chief, fire chief,
Secretary of State, judges (appointed and

are we ignored or silenced when

On the Nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas
To the United States Supreme Court
September 13, 1991

     Without a doubt, Judge Thomas has achieved a remarkable
success in his career, raising himself up from humble beginnings
to the nomination for the highest court in the land.  That is to
his great credit and I applaud him for it.

     Yet I have to believe that his confirmation to the highest
court in the land would not represent a step forward in the road
to racial progress but a U-turn on that road.  The record and
rhetoric of the man leaves me little confidence that his
confirmation would in any way help address the profound racial
problems and divisions that drag our country down.  His
statements on the Brown v. Board of Education case on
affirmative action, and even on the Roe v. Wade to me indicate
that he wants to push to clock back.

     African Americans I believe want to have confidence in the 
promise of the courts, we want to believe that they are a place
we can turn for the redress of the racial discrimination and many
deprivations that are still clearly rampant in our country.  The
Supreme Court decision in the Brown v. Board of Education
instilled in us the hope nearly forty years ago as did many
others that subsequently followed."

Reading Between the Line
Southfield H.S. What is a bad teacher?
Indifferent or unprepared to teach. Good
teacher will bond with and pay attention to
students. Students need high self esteem.
Parents should motivate their children to
study and do home work. Only two
students would want to teach school. 
Those against teaching said many youngsters have bad
attitudes or undisciplined, not taught
by parents to respect teachers.
Teacher
Helaine Wolf, teacher for 28 years
A teacher says her students like her. 
She and most students connect. Most teachers 
are working for the love of children,  not
the money. They are paid less money for
more work in Detroit than suburbs.
Attendance is poor which causes the
illiterate. Teachers are demoralized 
The children are wonderful. They make
teaching worthwhile.

I feel very honored standing here before you today -- the recipient of your highest
award.  I have always admired your organization for its contribution to the Civil
Rights movement and human justice.
In the early days of the Montgomery Ala. struggle, it was the UAW's Local 600, back in the [50's] Spring of 1956 -- 56,
[I believe that] I was invited to visit Detroit as your guest.  Twenty one years later, I
stand before this great organization, the officers and the delegates.
There is no greater tribute -- and I accept and appreciate this honor from the
bottom of my heart.  Not for myself alone, but for the more than 
40,000 who who remained of the bus in Montgomery, [the] under the
leadership of Dr. MLK - & others
Thank you very much.

The STAR and STRAW are two familiar symbols of Christmas: These are
words we sing . .

... ""O star of wonder, star of night, star with royal
beauty bright""
... A king might miss the guiding star
A Wise Man's foot might stumble
For Bethlehem is very far, from all except the 
humble ...""
What a challenge at Christmas, and for all the year.

The STAR we accept without understanding.  It is that ""something up
and out there"" beyond our lives, which we keep trying to reach.  It is 
that which gives meaning to our daily strivings.  It is a part of the 
intangible reality which we call joy, love and the search for peace.

Joy to the World; Let every heart prepare Him room,
..a Nobel Peace Prize for Martin Luther King
..the Presidency of the present U.N. Assembly by an African
..a national election victory for the forces of ""good will to men""
..an aborning awareness that ""wherever, in woe and want and
need, some soul lifts a gift of grace, to lend a hand where
stricken hearts bleed, there our God unveils His face"".

The STRAW we understand.  This is the soil of life; the main stuff of daily existence, and
often rough stuff...
...like being called America's most notorious liar...like being shot to death by
a rebel on a Congo wall...like being the 40 million United States poverty folk...
like being a minority youth inheriting deprivation...like being 800 million Chinese
not admitted to the United Nations...like being Africa's illiterate and diseased
millions...like being affluent and unfeeling of another's pain.
Yes, this is where man lives, suffering, poverty, disease, death and needing reconciliation.
""Despite not Him lying there,
First what He is inquire;
An orient pearl is often found
In depth of dirty mire.""

The STAR and the STRAW meet at CHRISTmas.
In some mysterious way, God's love manifested in the gift of His Son, comes and
dwells among us, as we ask,
""What comfort by Him do we win
Who made Himself the price of sin
To make us heirs of glory!
To see this Babe all innocence
A Martyr born in our defense
Can Man forget the story?""

""O star of wonder, star of night
Star with royal beauty bright
Guide us to thy perfect Light""

On the first of December, 1955, Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat to 
a white passenger on a Montgomery bus.  Her arrest and the subsequent development 
of a 381-day bus boycott by tens of thousands heralded a new phase in the civil 
rights movement.  Rallying in support of Mrs. Parks, the black community formed 
the Montgomery Improvement Association, electing as president Martin Luther King, 
Jr.; Mrs. Parks served for a time on its board of directors.  Fired from her job 
as assistant tailor at the Montgomery Fair department store due to the notoriety 
surrounding her name, Rosa Parks stayed in Montgomery until the boycott forced 
an end to all discriminatory practices on the bus lines.  She and her husband, 
however, then left in 1957 for Detroit to join her brother.  After working for a 
year at Hampton Institute in Hampton, Virginia, she returned to Detroit where in 
1965 she took a part-time job as a receptionist and administrative aide in the 
office of the United States Representative John Conyers.  Although she continues to 
make appearances across the country, much of her time has been devoted to caring 
for her ailing family.  Her husband and brother died in 1977, her mother in 1980.

Saluted nationwide for her refusal to cooperate with what was morally 
indefensible and for her willingness to accept the consequences of her decision, 
Rosa Parks was the first woman to receive the Martin Luther King, Jr. Nonviolent 
Peace Prize in 1980.  She was awarded an honorary degree from Mt. Holyoke College 
in 1981, and a move is now underway in Detroit by the National Committee for the 
Rosa L. Parks Shrine to commemorate her life by the establishment of a home and 
library."

RP: (cont.) towards freedom and what they were doing, contribution.
He asked the question, ""Why should I expect personal happiness when
so much depends on any contribution that I can make?"" But I find
myself asking myself, ""Why should I expect personal happiness, if
people want to find out what, who I am or what I am or what I have
done...?""

MMG: So you've really been, you've given yourself.

RP: Yes. Somewhat resigned to whatever contribution I can make, if
I'm making any contributions to, especially with young people,
where I go to schools to see if I can do them any... There are
timeswhen I feel I can hardly get up and go, and once I get there
and I see their reaction, I feel somewhat rewarded.

MMG: What kind of advice do you give young people today?

RP: I try to get them to look within themselves to find out what they're
trying to do in any given situation, and to look around them and
see the opportunities that they have, and do whatever they can to
make the best of the opportunities, to develop their potential,
as they grow up, to get the very best they can in education, get the
very best they can as human beings, and to above all have respect
in God's eyes, for themselves and other people.

MMG: How do you see the racial situation today? Do you think it's better
than when you were working in Alabama?

RP: I would have to say it is better, even with all the problems that
they have. Because if you go back to the days of old, the incident
of my arrest in Montgomery and shortly after the Supreme Court
decision on racial segregation in schools and...many things. I'd
have to say, with all the problems they have now, that there's still
much racism and reactionary attitudes among people, but you'd have
to say it's better, and it should be even better still.

MMG: What gives you the most satisfaction now, as you look back over
your life and your accomplishments, all that's happened to you?W
What pleases you?

RP: The fact that we have acquired enough freedom to be able to be
vocal and to say what we wish, act as human beings, and to make...
politically to see many of our people in top positions in the
government, all the way from Washington to local government.

MMG: I want to think you for this interview. Thank you very much."

RP: In the past few years, it's been so popular. That's another thing
that I hadn't searched my mind too closely on. I have been
involved so much in kind of family matters, illness and death of
my husband, my mother's illness.

MMG: When you hear talk about liberated women, does that mean anything
particular to you, or do you feel you've been pretty well liberated
all your life?

RP: Well, I feel to some extent in my mind that I have been liberated,
not physically always, but at least my thinking.

MMG: There was a film on television recently on King. Did you see that?

RP: Yes, I did.

MMG: And what did you think of the depictions?

RP: You mean, the actors?

MMG: Yes, and the way that the movement was represented.

RP: I felt that the representation stressed more violence and conflict
than the actual peace and harmony and love that Dr. King would have
wanted it to be. And the person who portrayed him, a good actor,
to my mind, did not capture Dr. King's manner as I remember it, his
position, actions, the way he spoke.

MMG: How about the way that you were represented?

RP: She did quite good. As I remember it, she spoke the words that I
did. When she got up and left the bus, she didn't look around at
anybody to see... I remember doing that. I remember just walking
right off the bus, with the officers when they told me I was
arrested, not looking at anybody or noticing what anybody was
thinking. For her part, she was good. Very quiet, she didn't get
excited or use any extra words.

MMG: You have become a symbol of the civil rights movement. There are
great demands made on your time, such as this interview. You're 
asked to visit and to speak all over the country, all the time. Has
this created problems for you in the private life that you must lead?

RP: Yes, it has. To a great extent, I feel that there are many other
things I would like to do and need to do, that I can't get to. I
don't feel like I really have a private life. There are many other
things that need my attention. But on the other hand, I always
have to refer to something Dr. King once said, in the early days in
Montgomery when his first child was very young, demands were made
on him, and he was thinking in terms of his not being able to be
the father and husband he would like to, he would like to spend
more time with his family. But at the same time, he would have to
speak about this, and he was called on, and he never had any time
at home, or when he was home, he was always being called there. Then,
of course...community with people, and how they were working together"

RP: (cont.) couldn't deal with at all, especially right near us,
because we were within a half a block, a short block from where
quite a bit of that was going on, and this particular grocery
store that was looted so very much by some of the people right
around us, and then some we knew and some that we didn't
know. It upset him very much because when he was working, these
people had given him quite a bit of work, and had been his customers.
And that upset him a great deal, he just couldn't, it was such a
severe thing to him, that he couldn't eat or sleep. They had a
curfew, and he wouldn't stay inside, and he was threatened by
some of the officers, I think the National Guard, because he didn't
stay inside the house. All the time, he would be outside looking,
seeing what was going on. Took him to the doctor, he had to have
a sedative to quiet his nerves, and it was hard on all of us.

MMG: Do you have any preference among the terms ""Negro,"" ""colored,"" and
""black""?

RP: Well, I've gotten into using ""black""quite a bit, and I never really
cared for the particular word ""colored."" Years ago, ""Negro"" was
considered proper. But I actually would prefer it if I didn't 
have to use any kind of racial terms...more concerned with
humanity, and not be so much involved that every person has to be
labeled racially.

MMG: I wanted to ask you a couple of questions about integration. Do
you see integration as open access to institutions, or does it also
involve social contact with white people. You know, being with
them, or just being where they are, in their schools, or also in
their homes, at parties in their churches, that kind of thing.

RP: I haven't given it too much thought, other than the fact that I feel
that people should be free to associate with any person that they
choose, without having to think in terms of their race, if that's
what they want to do. I don't think anyone should be ostracized
or circumscribed or denied association or contact with another
person as long as they're part of the world.

MMG: Do you think that there's any danger to black institution such as
churches and schools and some clubs from integration?

RP: I hadn't thought of any.

MMG: Is there any reason that all-black institutions, some of them,
should be preserved if they want?

RP: I hadn't actually thought of that either. Well, it would be good
to be able to appreciate their heritage. I don't know whether
that could be done if there were finally complete integration or
not. I hadn't gone into that in my mind too much.

MMG: Well, just a couple of last questions about the women's movement--
is that all right. It's 11:30. I just wanted to ask you
what you thought of the women's movement."

MMG: How did you come to Detroit?

RP: You mean, how did I travel?

MMG: Well, no, not that so much as what made you decide to go ahead and come?

RP: Because my brother was living here.

MMG: And you and your husband felt that conditions just weren't going to
get better immediately where they were?

RP: Well, they were not any too good. Of course, it was quite before
there was any disturbance or any harassment at that time. And my
mother wanted to spend as much time as she could with the two of us and
she couldn't spend time with him if she remained with me there. And
if she left me there, then she felt uneasy, I think. Part of our...,
she and my brother got together more so than I did, and found a place
for us to move, for us to live, and we came.

MMG: What was life like for you and your husband after you moved to Detroit?

RP: Well, it was not any too easy. Well, shortly after I moved to Detroit,
I was offered a job and accepted one in Hampton, Virginia, at Hampton
Institute. I earned a little money, and he was working in a barber
school. He didn't have a Michigan license or anything, so he had to
pass the examination, be officially [licensed]. He was working in a
barber school for a man of our [race], teaching some apprentice barbers
that work and training them.

MMG: Did you get any, ever get any specific support from civil rights
groups during this time when you first went to Detroit? Did they try
and offer you employment or see that you were taken care of or
anything?

RP: I didn't get any work, but I went to a lot of meetings, and sometimes
when they would take up contributions, but that was never high.

MMG: Ten years after you came to Detroit, there were race riots here in
the city. What were your feelings about the progress of the civil
rights movement at that point?

RP: I actually...I mean, I would see that... I would associate the
activity of the burning and looting, and so on, with what I had done
and would have done. And yet, on the other hand, if you looked
beneath the surface, we could see the frustration of some of these
people, they could see the deprivation. I guess for whatever
reasons it came about, I felt that something had to be wrong with
the system.

MGG: So you could understand it, although it might not have been the
way you would have gone about it.

RP: That's true. But it did...it was a very, very severe blow to my
husband, who wasn't well at the time. It was just something he just"

RP: (cont.'d) to the extent that you might not... There was one man who
was on the bus, he lived next door to where we lived, and he could
have if he'd wanted to, gotten off the bus to let my husband know that
I was arrested. My husband thinks kind of hard of him for not at least
telling him what had happened on the bus. Because he knew him very
well. And then there was another man who got on the bus, and he got on
just after me, 'cause I spoke to him as he was stepping on the bus.
He asked me a few days later if I had needed him as a witness, and I
said I didn't even remember...

MMG: Did you ever find out the name of that bus driver. Was there ever any
direct reference to him in the legal matters that developed later?

RP: OH, yes. I remember his name very shortly. His last name was Blake.
I can't remember his initial.

MMG: What does he think about the incident in retrospect? Do you remember
what he said?

RP: I can't remember exactly what he said. As far as he was concerned,
it was all in his duty.

MMG: What was your family's reaction? Your mother and brother and husband?

RP: Well, my mother was pretty upset when I called her. She answered the
telephone, and I told her I was in jail. And I don't remember exactly
what my brother said to me, he was here, in Detroit, not Montgomery.
I'll have to find out, better than I, if she can remember anhthing
special. I know he was... I don't know if he was so surprised or not,
but he was pretty upset, too. I'm sure. He didn't want us to...

MMG: During any of this time, just after the incident occurred, and you were
taken off and arrested, and broken arrest, yet did you ever feel fearful?

RP: Well, it was a strange feeling because you always feel that something
could...even before the incident of my arrest, I could leave home
feeling that anything could happen at any time...harassment. I
think the hardest days I had were when I was still working in the
department store. I would see some of the people who worked in the
store, and I don't know whether there was anything personal to it, I
could see their attitude, the attitude they had. Some of them were
very...well, they didn't say anything to me, but they were just, they'd
ignore me as though I wasn't there.

MMG: Were you ever involved with the Montgomery Improvement Association, or
the boycott that followed, in a policy making capacity?

RP: I was on the board--I'm trying to think, board of directors--and I sat
in on some meetings, but I didn't have too much time to be in the
actual planning. But I did for a short while. But at that time,
while so much of this was being fought, and so many plans were being
made, I was being invited away from Montgomery quite a bit. I don't
remember--it's hard to remember now, except that I did as many as I
could, if I could, and if they called on me, if they had any marching
or anything, if I could."

RP: (cont.'d) for the extension of the bus line in the same are and
the community where most of our people lived, instead of them having
to walk an hour, or whatever length of time it was... And then came the
[time] to propose it, and they were told that as long as they thought...
was there any need of them extending the line? This wasn't conscious
in my mind at that moment, but so many incidences where I think that
always make it appear that if a few of us form a committee, which
[try to ] have this thing remedied...make it appear that that was what
we wanted. And they were pleased that they didn't have to extend it,
as long as we accepted it to be that way. At this point I felt that,
if I did stand up, it meant that I approved of the way I was being
treated, and I did not approve.

MMG: Had you ever broken any segregation laws or practices previously?

RP: I had not, to a great extent, but I hadn't...I started to think about
some of the times...I, this to me... First of all, I wanted to say
that at this point on the bus ride, I didn't consider myself breaking
any segregation laws that I wanted...because he was extending
what we considered our section in the bus. I had refused on any number
of occasions to give my fare at the front of the bus, and then go around
to the back to get in. That was another thing that some of the bus
drivers would do. See, all of the bus drivers did not practice the
same...it was not uniform. There were just certain bus drivers that
would insist on you going to the back after you give him the fare.
You would step up in the bus, get in the bus, and then step back off
the bus and go around to the rear to enter. And neither did all of them
ask you to stand up if there was white people standing. So it seemed
like each driver was at his own discretion.

MMG: And this was a zealous one that you encountered that night.

RP: It seemed to be.

MMG: What was the reaction of the other black people on the bus when this
happened?

RP: They didn't any of them say anything to me. Some few did get off the
bus, and I know some of them asked for a transfer, and then some just
got off by main door. But during the time when I was there, all
remained the same exactly where they were.

MMG: Nobody tried to interfere with what was going on between you and the
white driver?

RP: NO.

MMG: Did you resent that in any way?

RP: No.

MMG: Did you expect some support?

RP: No, I didn't. It didn't even enter my mind. Because I knew that
attitude of people. It was pretty rough to go against the system"

RP: It wasn't always this...extremely. It was hard enough, but as we
didn't have any luxuries,...

MMG: You were active in the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP. When did you
begin work...

RP: That was the early 1940's. I think it was 1943. I found myself
secretary before I even... I had read about it, the Scottsboro
case. My husband was active before I was. People considered the
registering to vote...

MMG: Well, what were some of the projects that the NAACP was involved in
once you began work with them?

RP: When I first started as secretary, at the early date, we were not
doing that much. Well, mostly having meetings, I remember discussing
the segregation issue, but it doesn't seem like we were actually doing
anything special. I think the very first things I remember working on
was a rape case involving a young black serviceman in Georgia whose
father lived in Montgomery, and a white woman whose brother had been...
from childhood. We didn't have any legal representation in
Montgomery, and if we could get a person who had been violated in any
way to sign an affidavit, they would have to apply to the Department
of Justice in Washington.

MMG: There were no black attorneys to represent them.

RP: No, and no white attorneys in the early years, except there was one
that I can remember. In other words, if one would take a case for a person,
the white community ostracized [them]...

MMG: On the first of December, 1955, you refused to give up your seat to a
white passenger on a Montgomery bus. Your action and the subsequent
developments from that action resulted in a Montgomery bus boycott,
which in turn launched a new phase in the civil rights struggle. Other
black passengers could have refused to give up their seats. The person
next to you on the bus could have remained seated beside you. But
everyone else dutifully acquiesced to the white bus driver's demand
that they move. Only you stayed in your seat. Why?

RP: I think it was because I was so involved with the attempt to bring
about freedom from this kind of thing. I had seen so much within reach
on the basis of the Whitney Young experience under the same situation
that I felt that there was nothing else I could do to show that I was
not pleased with.... People have said that I was a great democrat,
people say things like that, but I was not conscious of being... I
felt just resigned to give what I could to protest against the way I
was being treated, and I felt that all of our meetings, trying to
negotiate, bring about petitions before the authorities, that is the
city officials, really hadn't done any good at all. And as long as
we continued to give them our patronage... I recall Mr. Eddie Mitchell
saying that he had a committee that had gone before the bus company

RP: (cont.'d) not that that... Somewhere, either at Roanoke or somewhere
he tried to pick up a trade as a barber. But [he did] other work:
farming, mill work, janitor--what we called a sexton down South--of a
white church. Tuskegee for a while, then he decided to go to Montgomery
but he had planned to attend school somewhere in the vicinity of Montgomery,
but didn't have the time. However, he went to Montgomery and
became a barber there.

MMG: How did you meet, the two of you?

RP: Well, he... A mutual friend of ours was a woman who knew him, she also
knew me, and she wanted us to meet. So finally it came that she told
him about where I lived, and he was going down,you know riding, and
trying to find our house and he saw my mother standing on the porch.
She had long hair, and he seemed to have been attracted to long hair,
so he said he thought he'd stop and inquire about me there, and he was
asking for Rosa McCauley, that he couldn't find the place where I was.
I think he inquired at some other places along the way, but couldn't
get any information. It could have been because he was so fair that
some of those people who even knew me wouldn't tell him where I lived,
they might have thought he was a member of the opposite race. But
he did, we did meet and started visiting, and we talked a lot. As
far as I knew, he's the first man I have ever talked with about our
racial situation, what was going on, the hardships.

MMG: So the two of you shared the commonality of early hard experiences,
hard work. Even though you were young people, you had heavy responsibilities,
both of you, and interest in the racial situation. Did you
have other interests in common?

RP: I think we did. I'm sure we must have, because I enjoyed, I just enjoyed
listening to him. I didn't talk a great deal. I was rather
quiet, and he, I enjoyed listening to him talk about whatever he wanted
to talk about. One of the things that... He was a very gentle person,
very polite. I didn't know exactly what to say, I guess, because I
hadn't been, I hadn't... The few boys--not too many--that I had been
in the company of were of a different disposition and they were all
right, I guess, but I suppose it didn't matter.

MMG: Well, you and your husband moved to Detroit in--what was it--1957?

RP: Yes.

MMG: How did you make a living together in the South before you came to
Detroit?

RP: Well, he was a barber, and some of the time I stayed home and did
sewing at home, very little money because living expenses were high.
And then I did some work for [insurance]. Finally in about...well,
during the war time, I started working at night. Sometimes I'd do
some sewing and I left that and started doing insurance work, so I
worked for the [Metro Life] Insurance Company, had a small [position];
then I gave that up, and started working for an office as a clerk."

MMG: What are their names?

MMG: In 1933 you married Raymond Parks. Is this in Tuskegee?

MMG: Oh, 1932.

RP: It was in Pine Level, my mother's home.

MMG: Oh, I see. Would you tell me a little about your husband?

RP: Well, he was a barber in Montgomery, Alabama. I was eighteen, he was
maybe twenty-two at the time. He was also an orphan, he didn't have
a living mother or father. He was living in Montgomery, working in a
barber shop, the Atlas barber shop. One of the things that interested
me most [about him was] the fact that he was very neat, very thin, very
serious behavior. His interest was with the Scottsboro case, working
to free them, so he would tell me about the trial, what was going on,
what was happening. And he would tell me some of the things that
happened to him as a child. He had been deprived of an education and
yet in appearance you would never believe that he was an illiterate
person. In fact, I don't think he was illiterate, because he taught
himself to read when he was in school. He would tell me about his
grandmother, his grandfather. His father and his mother did not remain
together--they had separated. He never knew him. His mother was dead.
Some of the tragic things that he... Well, he came from Randolph
County, Alabama, the little place that he was born was called...
where he lived in Roanoke, Alabama, some of the experiences that he had.
He was from a community where there were very few black people. One 
of the reasons that he didn't attend school until later... There were
no schools at all where he could go unless he could go to a white school,
but the nearest what we called, colored school, was too far away for
him to get there. So at that time, he was about ten years old, his
grandfather and grandmother both were ill and he had to do what he
could, try to work to help them, cook for them. I think they'd have
wished that he spent... About 1913, when he was ten, and I was just
a baby--and he didn't have shoes, didn't have food much of the time,
[didn't] get enough food, he had a rough time of it.
When he left Roanoke and went to Tuskegee, and he went...I think he
said he started school--that was after his mother, she had another
child... At her death, he moved in with a cousin and he started going
to school when he was twenty-one years old.

MMG: And he was starting out then at the beginning?

RP: Yes, going to school. I think he advanced to the seventh grade of
school. He went to Tuskegee Institute, he got to go to school there--"

But I couldn't understand why, if we were free people, that we had to be deprived of the better things like a building.

MMG: Were you grandparents also from Alabama?  Were they born there?

RP: Yes, they were.  I think, though...I don't know whether my grandfather was born in Georgia or his people, they were, when they were bringing slaves over, I think the first place they landed was some place in Georgia.  And some of them came from Georgia, but as far as I know, my grandparents were born in Alabama.  Now my great-grandfather, my grandmother's father was brought from the old country.  he was born...he was of Scotch-Irish descent.  But I at a certain time didn't know he was not a black person.  I thought he was just a light skinned person...I found later in his life, in talking to people, that he was not of African descent at all.  But my great-grandmother, his wife, was completely...Rosa.  My mother's grandparents...

MMG: What was their name?

RP: My great-grandfather was named James Percival, and his wife, before she married him was Mary Jane Noble, it was Nobles.  So they were raising a family before Emancipation, and when the third child was born, the baby at the time...There were already two children.  My grandmother was the first child, and the next one was a girl, the next one was a boy.

MMG: So you saw Mr. Percival?  Pictures of him, or what?

RP: Oh, I remember him because he died when I was about six...I believe about six years old.  Six or seven.  But I remember him very well.

MMG: So you didn't know he was a white man.

RP: No, I didn't.  And he was a very likable elderly person.  He died at the age of ninety-six.  But his wife, my great-grandmother, died in 1915, same year my brother was born, so I don't remember her.  I wasn't quite three years old then, I just remember talking about her.

MMG:  Well, since we're talking about grandparents, I should ask you again about your father's people.  Were they also from Alabama?  Did you know them?

RP: They were from Alabama, but not from Montgomery County.  They came from Abbeville, Alabama, which is in Henry County.  That's where my grandfather and grandmother raised their family.  My father was the oldest son, and the second child; there was one sister older.  They had a very [large family].  I think my mother said she was visiting my grandmother...actually, my mother said there were about twenty, but some of them didn't survive.  But at her death she had ten living children.  She had lost almost half.  I think she lost one son before he was in his teens.  Out of that large family, I have one aunt, the youngest daughter of that family, and my uncle, who was next to my father."

RP: ... I sewed quite a bit, although I didn't feel like I wanted to sew
for a living. I found myself doing quite a bit of that for myself
and my cousins and others. I remember I did sewing for the family of a
friends, and I often remember that she was very economical with material,
and she could have a piece of material and make a dress for myself
out of one, she made for herself and some of the neighbors.

MMG: What was the role of the church in your life during that period?
Were you much involved with church activities?

RP: Yes, church, and Sunday school also, all the time in Montgomery.
It was one of the events that I could look forward to. I have always
liked to attend church...all the people in the church would be singing
and praying. I can remember enjoying hymns, singing hymns, say the
Lord's Prayer, you know, even when I was a child--it was just a part
of my life. And we are members of the A.M.E. church--that is the
African Methodist Episcopal church--and we had a group called the Allen
Christian Endeavor League, that would meet on Sundays, just before
the night prayers. And I enjoyed that because it was where I learned
of Bishop Allen and ...

MMG: Which led to the foundation of the A.M.E. church.

RP: Yes. It is the organization of the A.M.E. church. I have always felt--
I don't know just when it began or how, maybe if I thought a little
more about it I could... And that's sort of in my family background,
too. The Lord's power within me to do what I have done...

MMG: Were there, apart from your family and your church, any other persons
or events in those early years that you would say were important influences
on you?

RP: Do you mean racially, or just as a person in any way...

MMG: Well, of any nature. Of any nature, including racially.

RP: I believe...well, my mother was my teacher while...part of the time 
when I was in rural school. I think about three years... I remember 
my mother's teaching very well, that she was very sincere... She
didn't just put the work before the youngsters. If they needed any
help, she would take time out to make sure that they were learning
what she was teaching. One of the things that I always appreciated
about her was if there was anything that came up of a racial nature,
she never impressed upon me, that even with segregation and going
through a schoolhouse that was just a little shack--you might call it
a shack, a building with no glass windows--that it was the way it was
supposed to be. And sometimes my grandfather and grandmother, also--
these are my mother's parents--I learned what it was like for them as
small children during slavery and before Emancipation. In our family,
that's how we referred to the time of Emancipation as when the Yankees
came through...The hardships, the struggles, before the Yankees came
through, to let the people know, the slaves know, that they were free."

Did you have contact with your father after your parents
separated?

RP: No, not very much. I do remember him visiting our home for a few days
when I was about, I think about seven years old. Either five or seven.
I was quite young, first time I ever saw him to remember him, and he
didn't stay very long. I didn't see him anymore until after I was
married. That was quite a few years ago.

MMG: What part of the North did he come from?

RP: Well, several places. He was in New York part of the time, and Ohio.
Many states. I don't know just how many he lived in, but I guess you'd
call him a person who didn't, wasn't stable enough to settle for a
long time in one place.

MMG: What was your aunt's name that you stayed with?

RP: Her name was Fanny Williamson. She was a widow.

MMG: Well, do you... It sounds like you had a lot of work, you've been
working all your life.

RP: That's true, I have. Oh, that's right. That's when I learned to sew,
and one of the things I liked to do was piece quilts. We took little
squares and we sewed them together to make a quilt. And I liked to
cook. My grandmother would permit me, and I thought it was a great
privilege to cook, help her with the cooking, and what not, and set the
table, wash the dishes, things like that. I remember, I could milk
the cow when I was quite young, do the washing, a lot of things that
I did that I think was because... Much of what I did was because my
mother was away a great deal. She was also in kind of frail health.
She wasn't a very strong woman. I did just about all that I could to
keep things, to make things as light as I could for her. Of course,
my grandmother being ill and a semi-invalid... Also my grandfather,
who passed away when I was ten years old, I had to look after him as
well as I could.

MMG: When you were young, were you ever thinking about what you might do
when you grew up?

RP: There wasn't a great deal to think about when I... There were not too
many opportunities. My mother had hoped, I think, that I would be a
teacher, but life as a teacher in a rural community seemed so very hard
that it didn't appeal to me at that time that much. I was concerned 
with trying to get an education and be prepared to have a career. I
thought very strongly of nursing when I was real young. I suppose with
so many ill members of the family, I felt a sympathy for ill people.
Of course, I myself was not too strong. I had suffered tonsillitis
when I was still a baby, about two years old. I think my tonsils were
removed at the age of eleven, just before my mother put me to school
in Montgomery. After that I didn't get into any nurse training, I had
a lot of experience with the family and friends..."

Well, people called it Miss White's school, but the
actual name of it, Montgomery Industrial School.

MMG: Did the women who taught there come from a particular church
affiliation?

RP: I don't know about their individual church affiliation, but I think
that she was Congregational.

MMG: This is part two of an interview with Mrs. Rosa Parks. The inteview
is taking place in the interviewer's room at the St. Regis Hotel,
Detroit. The date is the twenty-third of August, 1978. Mrs. Parks,
you were talking yesterday about your family and your family background,
and you were telling me about where you went to school and what the
situation was like there. What do you remember about leisure activities
when you were a girl?

RP: I didn't have too much leisure. Well, first of all, when I was going
to Miss White's school, it was a private school, and there was a
tuition fee. I can't remember what the amount was, but my mother
obtained what was called a scholarship, where I could clean two
classrooms after school and sweep the floor and dust the desks and
tidy it up for the evening. But it really meant that I didn't have
to...that she didn't have to pay tuition for me. At that time, I
lived quite a long way from school, so I was walking home from school.
Then, going to where I lived, there would be general chores around the
the house, getting my uniform washed and cleaning it for the next day, 
and doing other things around the house. I lived with my aunt, she was
quite ailing in health, she worked at that time at the Jewish country
club. Because she was so ill she would take me along with her children
to the place where she worked, and you know, help her do some of the
work that she couldn't do, cleaning and doing dishes, and so on. And
we did a great deal of work under her supervision, it was a job. And
there were times when we would go just walking along the roadside 
through the woods, because this was not right downtown, this was out
on the edge of the city, and pick berries. And occasionally we would,
if enough of us children could get together and we'd have a little
time, we might play a little ball. But I never had a whole lot of
leisure time just to play. There was always duties and things to do.
When we were in Pine Level, however, I used to go fishing with my
grandmother a great deal and I rather enjoyed that, because we'd catch
the fish and then we'd have some fish for supper when we got home.

MMG: I don't know if I asked you, what was your grandmother's name?

RP: My mother' s mother was named Rosa Edwards. She was married to Sylvester
Edwards.

MMG: Were you named for her?

RP: Yes, I was. And also, my father's mother was named Louise, and I'm
named for her, too."

MMG: And what was his name?

RP: His name was Sylvester James McCauley.

MMG: So then you stayed in Alabama in the Pine Level area until you married?
Is that right or did you move?

RP: No, I attended school in Montgomery, the city of Montgomery, from the
time I was eleven years old until I finished--well, I didn't finish 
high school--until I had to leave high school.

MMG: Did you live with relatives then, or board or ...

RP: I lived with my mother's sister most of the time, and sometimes
other people. I stayed once in a while with one of my mother's girlfriends.
But most of the time I spent was with my mother's sister.

MMG: What are your memories of that early schooling?

RP: Well, it's hard for me to recall. The school that I was attending
was an all girls school with white women teachers and principal, women
who came from various parts of the North to teach, and they were all
unmarried women. I suppose they must have had dedication, because at
that time, being white and teaching black children, they were separated
from the white community. They lived in a building next to the school
building--that was their dormitory where they lived. We were taught,
aside from just the regular reading, writing and arithmetic, we were
taught home economics and sewing--I guess home economics would be the
same thing--cooking and sewing. It's a little difficult for me to
express any special interest, because I know Miss White, the principal,
was a very strict disciplinarian, and she always saw to it that the
girls were not liars, or that they dressed neatly, wore no jewelry.
She frowned on--we called it bobbed hair, at that time--cutting of the
hair, and so on.

MMG: Sounds like it must have...

RP: We wore uniforms, the blue dress with the white dots.

MMG: Must have been kind of like being in a convent?

RP: I think at school it just about was. Of course, we did have some
recreation, played a little basketball. One of the younger women
taught basketball.

MMG: Were there subjects that you especially enjoyed?

RP: It seemed worthwhile, just about all the subjects...
At that time I seemed to enjoy reading so much that almost any subject
was interesting to me.

MMG: What was the name of that school, do you remember?"

Mrs. Parks, you were born on February 4,

Leona McCauley. What was your mother's 
maiden name?

Rosa Parks: Edwards.

Marcia M. Greenlee: Edwards. Could you tell me something about
your family background?

Rosa Parks: My mother was a teacher in the rural schools
in Alabama, and my father was a carpenter.
When they married, they moved to Tuskegee
and started keeping house, and that's where
I was born. Shortly after I was about, maybe
not quite two years old, my father wanted
to go to the North to live and work and he ...
they broke up housekeeping. My mother came
back to the rural part of Montgomery County,
Pine Level, Alabama, to live with her parents,
my grandmother and grandfather. This was
when my brother was born.

Marcia L. Greenlee: This was Pine Level?

Rosa Parks: Yes, Pine Level, Alabama. It was in
Montgomery County, about thirty miles south
of Montgomery, the capital of Alabama. I 
can remember when I was quite small my
mother was teaching in a one-teacher rural
school ... various places in the county. 
Sometimes they would be the church buildings
where she would hold classes, with one, two ...
It was through the sixth grade, I believe
it was.

Marcia M. Greenlee: All in the same room?

Rosa Parks: In the same room.

A gentle and unassuming woman whose decision to test to practice of Jim 
Crow triggered the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott, Rosa. L. Parks was a catalyst, 
one of those rare individuals who at a time of crisis express with great 
clarity the aspirations of an entire people. ""I felt if I did not resist being 
mistreated that I would spend the rest of my life being mistreated,"" she 
reflected later, and it was this single action, taken out of her own unique sense 
of personal worth and responsibility, that so effectively challenged long-entrenched 
barriers to a more equal and integrated society in the United States.

Rosa Louise was born on February 4, 1913, in Tuskegee, Alabama, the older 
child of James and Leona Edward McCauley.  Her father worked as a carpenter 
and her mother taught school in the countryside but, two years after her birth, 
her parents separated and Mrs. McCauley returned to Pine Level, Alabama, to 
live with her parents and continue teaching.  Rosa was a dutiful and hardworking 
child, caring for her grandfather and helping with household chores while 
attending school with her mother.  Raised from an early age to have both a deep 
respect for education and a growing consciousness of the inequality of opportunity 
mandated by the state's segregation laws, Rosa at age eleven was sent to 
Montgomery where, while living with an aunt, she enrolled in a private girls' 
school known as Miss White's.  In 1932 she married Raymond Parks, a serious young 
barber from Montgomery with whom she spent many hours discussing the burden and 
injustice of the racial situation.  Mr. Parks was a member of the National Committee 
to Save the Scottsboro Boys, and she soon joined her husband in becoming active 
in the Montgomery chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of 
Colored People, serving as its secretary and youth adviser.  She also attended a 
workshop at the Highlander Center in Tennessee, an integrated institution known 
since the 1930s for training organizers in social causes."

Since July 1976 the Schlesinger library of Radcliffe College, with
support from The Rockefeller Foundation, supplemented in 1980 by grants from
The Blanchard Foundation of Boston and the National Institute on Aging, has
been conducting a project to record and transcribe the autobiographical
memoirs of a group of black American women 70 years of age or older. The
purpose of the project is to develop a body of resources on the lives of black
women in the twentieth century, especially in the years prior to the Civil Rights
Movement, and to make this material available to researchers and students
interested in the struggles of women and racial minorities in the United States.
Many interviewees have had professional careers in such fields as education,
government, the arts, business, medicine, law and social work. Others have
combined care for their families with voluntary service to their communities. 
All have made significant contributions toward the improvement of the lives of
black people and to the development of American society.

In the past, the black woman often has not created a written record of her
experiences, and when such a record has been created, it is not usually found
in libraries or archives, the traditional repositories for historical documents. 
One means of attempting to capture and preserve such lives is the oral interview,
which explores the influences and events that have shaped each woman's
experience and gives her an opportunity to reflect on the past and to present
her point of view on historical events. The interviews of the Black Women Oral
History Project offer fresh source material that can add an important
dimension to the study of the history of the United States. They supplement
and comment on other sources as they examine the active participation of a
group whose members were previously overlooked as being only shaped by and not
shapers of historical events."

each other. Negroes could not sit in front of white persons,
leaving vacant seats in front of buses
on all routes, enough to accomodate at least
10 persons on predominantly Negro routes.
The bus drivers would take fares from
passengers in the front door and have
them enter the rear door if he did not
want them to stand too near the front

passed waiting passengers without stopping
[to pick them], if the rear of the bus was
filled, making many workers late for

change for passengers to pay fares. They

With the wall artificial segregation between the races,
the white man formed in his own [wh] mind what
he thought was what the Negro should have, which
is an inferior status in life, second class citizenship, 
restricted action as a human being. He worked
very hard to educate the Negro into believing 
that he is happier segregated, discriminated
against, mistreated and humiliated. Such a good
job of ""brain washing"" was done on the Negro, that
[for] a militant Negro was almost a freak of 
nature to them, many times ridiculed by others
of his own group.

The schools in the south were the best
training ground for teaching Negro inferiority
and white supremacy. A young child starting 
to school could very soon learn that the 
white children went to beautiful well appointed 
and equipped school buildings, while Negro
children went to roughly built, uncomfortable
shacks, with no desks, but rough plank benches. 
The white rode buses, the Negro walked
long weary miles in all kinds of [th] weather,
cold, wind and rain, as well as the scortching
heat of summer. In my own early school
days, our term was 5 months, the white 9
months, in the rural community. It was
very rare indeed for a young  Negro to look"

In Montgomery, Ala, the Cradle of the Confederacy, Heart of Dixie
there exist some strange and varied customs of racial segregation and
Jim Crow laws. There is much evidence everywhere of
integration being practiced between the races some where and
sometimes for a long, long time. Night time integration and
day time segregation makes this a very mixed up place.
It is not easy to remain rational and normal mentally
in such a setting where even in our air port in
Montgomery, there is a white waiting room, none for
colored except an unmarked seat in the entrance. It doesn't say
who should take this seat. There are rest room facilities
for white ladies and colored women, white men and colored men.
We stand outside after being served at the same ticket
counter instead of sitting on the inside. Also there is
only one drinking fountain. We board the plane and
find no segregation.
   On arrival in B'ham, we note one waiting
room, but white and colored drinking fountains. I did
not go down stairs to the rest rooms. Neither am I very
thirsty during this brief wait of about one hour.
   This time gives me a little while to go back in
my mind to my home in Montgomery and its
unique position today. Where segregation was the order
of the day, way of life and accepted pattern
apparently [ac] taken for granted by all with the
exception of a few persons who were called [many]
[th] radicals, sore heads, agitators, trouble makers,
to name just a few terms given them. The masses
seemed not to put forth too much effort to
struggle against the status quo."

     Some common practices of Montg'y City Lines bus drivers
toward Negro passengers before the protest began
on Dec 5, 1955:  In accordance with the racial segregation
law, whites occupy the front of the bus. Negroes the 
rear. There were always reserved seats for white
passengers, even if [they] they never boarded a bus.
At least space for 10 persons. This practice
forced Negroes to stand [ove] while seats were
empty. Drivers would also pass Negroes without
picking them up, with front section empty.
When the rear of the bus was filled, many times
he required Negro passengers to give him the
fare at the front door, and go to the rear
to get in the bus, no matter how [crowed]
crowded it would be. There were times that
he would drive away and leave the passenger
if too much time was taken in getting on.
   Negroes were, by far, the majority of bus
riders on almost all routes, [as they] many
worked in all the white residential areas,
and students attending school used bus
transportation."

I thought of my poor great grandmother
who in slavery days could not do
more or know more than to
be used and abused by the
slave owner. She was bred,
born and reared to serve no
other purpose than that which
resulted in the bastard issue
to be trampled, mistreated and abused
by both Negro slave and white
master. It is said she was a
rarely beautiful girl, skilled in
finest sewing. She died young, leaving
three small children - 2 sons - 1 daughter
my grandfather was her older son.
At this moment the state of Ala
was doing everything possible to
electrocute 9 young Negro boys, the
Scottsboro boys, for the alleged rape
of two white women hoboes.

what can I do?"""

TO BRANCH AND YOUTH OFFICERS:
Very soon the Congress will be debating and acting upon a bill to 
grant the states Federal aid for the construction of schools.
In the past year certain Southern states have defied the ruling of 
the Supreme Court outlawing segregated schools and have declared they will not 
obey it.
The NAACP position now, as it was last year, is that no Federal funds 
for schools construction should go to states which do not comply with the 
Supreme Court ruling.
Your branch should write to your Congressmen and Senators asking that
the school construction bill contain a clause which says in effect that grants
or funds shall be available only to those states or school districts which
promise that they are taking steps to comply with the Supreme Court ruling and
are desegregating their school systems.
This clause will not deny funds to any state that is law-abiding.  It
will not ""kill"" the school aid bill.  The people who will ""kill"" the bill, if 
it is killed, will be those Senators and Congressmen from some Southern states
who are determined to keep segregation even if the rest of the United States
does not get any Federal aid for schools.
Please say to your Congressmen and Senators that the Federal government
must not use its funds to subsidize those states like Mississippi, Georgia, etc.,
that have openly stated they intend to maintain segregation.  If these states
want to try to maintain Jim Crow, let them pay for their efforts themselves and
not use the tax money from the rest of the United States to cheat Negro children
of a decent education and to defy a ruling of the highest court in the land.
Remember, our annual convention resolutions for the past several years
have directed anti-segregation amendments as a policy of the NAACP.  The
resolutions of the 1954 and 1955 conventions specifically named Federal aid to 
school construction bills as those requiring an anti-segregation clause or
amendment.
This campaign in Congress will be a battle.  Don't let up on it for a 
minute.  Pin your Congressmen and Senators down on the issue and keep them
pinned down.
Keep us advised of their replies.
Very sincerely yours, 
[Roy Wilkins]

WHAT YOU CAN DO

1. Advise interstate travelers in your community to insist upon their right to unsegregated use of transportation facilities in the area. When traveling across state lines or buying tickets across state lines, tell them not to use the colored waiting room, not to obey the colored or white signs in the station. Report to us where such signs remain.

2. Tell them to insist on the right to sit where they please in the coaches or buses where seats are unreserved. If seats are reserved and they are given reserved seats, be certain they are not given a reserve seat in a railroad coach where only Negroes are sitting and on the bus be certain that the seats occupied by Negro passengers are not in the rear unless those are the only seats available.

3. NAACP Branch officers are asked to observe whether the law is being obeyed and report any infraction of the ICC ruling to the National Office. The ICC ruling does not cover restaurants. Do not be surprised that restaurants are still segregating Negroes.

AIRPORTS

The Legal Department is now ready to move against the airlines and airports. Inform air passengers to forward complaints with respect to segregation in the airports immediately to this office.
The decisions we have won in transportation will only be effective as our Branches are in enforcing them. We are urging Negroes not to submit to Jim Crow interstate travel and hope that your Branch will notify us of any infractions which come to your attention.

I was completely alone, without a
friend. The one I held most dear had
become an enemy aligned with the
hostile white race against me.
I cried bitterly that I would 
be lynched rather than be run
over by them. They could get the
rope ready for me any time they
wanted to do their lynching.
While my neck was spared of the
lynch rope and my body was never
riddled by bullets or dragged by an
auto, I felt that I was lynched many
times in mind and spirit. I grew up
in a world of white [?]
power used most cruelly
and cunningly to suppress poor
helpless black people. White riches,
black poverty. As small children we

To NAACP BRANCH AND YOUTH OFFICERS:
Re: Interstate Commerce Commission Ruling
By the time you receive this directive you will have had an
opportunity to ascertain the manner in which the railroads are carrying
out the Interstate Commerce Commission ruling which became effective January
10, 1956 requiring interstate railroad carriers and interstate buses to cease
enforcing segregation in railroad coaches, buses and in station waiting rooms.
The ruling specifically involved some ten interstate carriers in a suit brought
by the NAACP and the Carolina Bus Company.  The ICC ruling banned segregation
as a violation of the Interstate Commerce Act and Motor Vehicle Carriers Act
and the ruling applies to all interstate railroads, buses, and waiting rooms.
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?
1. The ruling affects travel (interstate) that crosses state lines.
It does not touch travel (intrastate) wholly within one state.
2. Previous decisions have barred segregation in dining and pullman
cars of interstate railroads and have barred southern states from requiring
the carriers to segregate passengers moving in interstate commerce.
3.  The present decision now reaches all aspects of interstate railroad
and bus travel and outlaws the segregated waiting rooms, segregated
toilets, drinking fountains, ticket windows, coaches, etc.  It does not, however,
outlaw segregated restaurants in station waiting rooms.
4.  Under the present ruling, buses and railroads may segregate
passengers who travel within the state but cannot segregate passengers who
travel across state lines.  Already we have seen some confusion resulting where
in a few instances the carriers are attempting to maintain separate waiting
rooms, toilets, etc., for intrastate passengers but will permit interstate
passengers to use these facilities without segregation in accordance with the
ruling of the ICC.
We are interested in finding out the exact practice in the area
covered by your Branch and are requesting that you ascertain what is happening
and inform the National Office.  Most of the carriers seem to be complying with
the ruling.

Perhaps he never thought of it again.
I don't know why I remembered to
mention it later to Grandma sometime later as
we were alone in the kitchen.
To me she was the most wonderful
person alive. I loved her dearly
to the end of her life. I always
like talking things over with her
and told her most everything.
I was not at all prepared
for her stern reprimand of, ""Gal,
you had better learn that white
folks is white folks and how to
talk and not talk to them. You
better stop being so ""high strung""
or you will be lynched before

scared you won't live to be

Dear Rosa:
Your very sweet
letter was received and I was
very glad indeed to hear from
you, but sorry to know that
your mother was in bed
sick. I always enjoy reading
your sweet loving letters.
I hope you are in the best 
of health. I am asking you 
to please forgive me for not
answering your letter sooner.
Why I did not was because
I wanted to send you something
for your birthday, and
I made you an apron, and
embroidered it, it taken
me a little time to do it, but
I hope you will"

I received your

was very glad indeed to hear
from you, as I was thinking
and saying to myself
that you had forgotten me.
You don't know how much
better I felt, after I had received

I think of you every day & night
and say, I hope some day I

I am still in school, and hope

Atty. Webster W. Posey
616 West Ninth Street
Cincinnati, Ohio

Dear Atty. Posey:
     Thanks very much for your letter of January 31 inviting me to
be one of your 1957 speakers. Please pardon this delayed reply. My
mother was quite ill when your letter came and other problems were
pressing upon me also at that time.
     At present, my schedule is open except April 7 at Trenton, N.J.
and April 14 at Birmingham, Alabama. You may arrange your program,
excluding these dates, to your convenience.
     I received expense and $100 honorarium from two larger branches,
Cleveland, O. and Baltimore, Md. last September. An itinerary to
several smaller branches in Mass., New York, New Jersey and Penna.
was arranged by the NAACP National Office last November for me.
Each branch gave me $25 and contributed to the expense through the
New York office. It was considered quite successful, though very
strenous for me.
     You may write Mr. Gloster Current if you prefer my appearance
on a similar arrangement. The choice is yours as I do not know the
size and financial status of your branch.
     You may be interested in knowing that in the case of my original
arrest; the Court of Appeals upheld the decision of the Circuit
Court which found me guilty last February 22. I am not waiting for
the lawyer's advice on the next course of action regarding it.
     With kindest regards, I am
Sincerely yours,
Rosa L. Parks"

Dear Mrs. Treuhaft:
     I am very happy to hear from you again. Thanks, very
much for the contribution and the names of other contributors.
     We are having a difficult time here, but we are not 
discouraged. The increased pressure seems to strengthen us for the
next blow.
     My first case was heard in the Circuit Court February 22,
I was found guilty and sentenced to 70 days in jail. The appeal
was made to the State Supreme Court.
     I was immediately arrested again with the leaders of the
bus protest.
     We have received very generous contributions from over
the country, although no specific appeal has been made through the 
mail.
     The wide spread publicity we are getting is most disturbing
to the local governing group. They resent outside interference.
Therefore, I will have to take the matter of direct appeal to the
Montgomery Improvement Association.
     The Claudette Colvin Case is one of four filed with the
Federal Court at present. 
     I will write again soon.
Sincerely yours,
Rosa L. Parks"

Remember, how long some of us had to wait

Do not call for transportation if you

In calling for transportation, try not [the]
to hold the line too long. Be as brief as

you wish to go and phone number, if you
can be called back.

TAKE A DAY AND CHANGE YOUR LIFE!
Dear Community Leader,
On Saturday, September 27, 1986, a one-of-a-kind event will take place 
here in Detroit.  Something that will add more productivity and meaning to
our lives.  The experience is the Les Brown Experience, an all-day seminar
that will help us identify and focus on our strengths, isolate and minimize our
weaknesses, and put our natural personal power to work on the things that 
matter most.
The actual title of the seminar is 'Rosa L. Parks presents ""The Les Brown
Experience:  Four Stages of Personal Growth.""  He explains and illustrates 
through interaction how to respond, rather than react to today's challenges.
I have heard Les Brown speak, I have heard abbreviated segments of his
seminar and he is powerful!  He commands the same attention the late Doctor
Martin Luther King, Jr. did.  Therefore, I will be there for the full session.
The enclosed flyer details how you can put this experience into your life and
the life of another.  It describes price, location and other particulars you will
want to know.
Les is a messenger of hope and this seminar will give solid, concrete ways to
enrich and command our lives.  I am looking forward to September 27, and I
hope to see you there.
Love, Peace and Prosperity,
Rosa L. Parks (signed)

Lift Ev'ry Voice and Sing

Lift ev'ry voice and sing, Till earth and heaven ring,
Ring with the harmonies of liberty;
Let our rejoicing rise high as the list'ning skies,
Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.

Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us.
Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us,
Facing the rising sun of our new day begun,
Let us march on til victory won.

Stony the road we trod, bitter the chast'ning rod,
Felt in the days when hope unborn had died;
Yet with a steady beat, have not our weary feet
Come to the place for which our fathers sighed?

We have come, treading our path thro' the blood of the slaughter,
Out from the gloomy past, Till now we stand at last
Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast.

God of our weary years, God of our silent tears,
Thou who has brought us thus far on the way;
Thou who has by Thy might, led us into the light,
Keep us forever in the park, we pray.

Lest our feet stray from the places, our God where we met Thee,
Lest our hearts, drunk with the wine of the world, we forget Thee,
Shadowed beneath Thy hand, May we forever stand,
True to our God, True to our native land."

FOUNDERS
MISS ALICE WHITE
MISS MARGARET BEARD

Montgomery Industrial School was founded in 1986 by 
Miss Alice White and Miss H. Margaret Beard who were, at
that time, recent graduates of Eastern schools with a 
desire to dedicate their lives to the education of Black 
girls in the South.  They chose Montgomery, Alabama and
established a school-kindergarten through eighth grade, 
with a facility of all white female teachers.  In later
years,  the ninth grade was added.  All funds for building
a school,  purchasing a teachers' home,  and for the 
operation of the school were donated by interested 
persons in Northern,  Eastern,  and Western cities with 
special assistance and contributions coming from The
American Missionary Association of New York.  Additional
teachers,  recruited for various parts of the  Country,
included Miss Gertrude Nason and Miss Charlotte Russell, 
both who remained at the school until it closed, May 
1927.  It was in existence for 41 years."

Rosa Louise Parks is often (and properly so) 
referred to as 'Mother of the Modern Freedom 
Movement' in America.  Her refusal on December 1, 1955 
to surrender her seat on a city bus as 
required by racial segregation ordinances (laws) 
in Montgomery, Alabama triggered a wave of 
protest that was to reverberate throhout the 
United States. That was the begining of more 
action by Black People and other defenders of 
American Democracy in a wave against every type 
of anti- 'Negro/Black segregationist practice 
which was practiced principally in the Southern 
States in those times. This most courageous act 
taken by quiet and unassuming little lady 
completely altered the manner in which America 
viewed its Black citizens, and redirected the 
course of American History. 

Mrs. Parks continues on the course she originally 
chose many years ago. Quiet, unassuming and 
dignified, working with and encouraging the 
youth. She has criss-crossed America over a 
dozen times - appearing at schools, colleges, 
churches, civic groups and organizations; 
hoping to spread love, and understanding. She 
believes that America's hope lies with young 
people.
A quiet exemplification of courage, dignity and 
determination, Rosa L. Parks will ever be a 
symbol of the American will to be and to 
remain free.

- THANKS -
The committee expresses special thanks to everyone 
who responded, contributed, and participated 
in this occasion. This program has been a success 
because of your support; again - THANK YOU.

have a 
dream.

I have a dream that one day out in the red hills of
Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of
former slaveowners will be able to sit down together
at the table of brotherhood.
I have a dream that one day even the state of
Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of
oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of
freedom and justice.
I have a dream that my four little children will one
day live in a nation where they will not be judged
by the color of their skin but by their character.
I have a dream today.
I have a dream that one day every valley shall be
engulfed, every hill shall be exalted and every
mountain shall be made low, the rough places will 
be made plains, and the crooked places will be 
made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be
revealed and all flesh see it together.
This is our hope. This is the faith that I will go
back to the South with. With this faith we will be
able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone
of hope.
With this faith we will be able to work together, to
pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail
together, to climb up for freedom together, knowing
that we will be free one day.
This will be the day when all of God's children will
be able to sing with new meaning, ""My country, 'tis
of thee, Sweet land of liberty, Of thee I sing. Land
where my fathers died. Land of the Pilgrims pride,
From every mountainside, Let freedom ring. ""
And if America is to be a great nation, this must
become true. So, let freedom ring from the mighty
mountains of New York. 
Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies
of Pennsylvania.
Let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies
of Colorado.
Let freedom ring from the curvacious slopes of
California.
But not only that, let freedom ring from the Stone
Mountain of Georgia.
Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of
Tennessee
Let freedom ring from every hill and mole hill of
Mississippi and every mountainside.
When we let freedom ring, when we let it ring from
every tenement and every hamlet, from every
state and every city, we will be able to speed up
that day when all of God's children, black men and
white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and
Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the
words of the old spiritual, ""Free at last, free at last! 
Thank God Almighty, we are free at last.""

Building 
a future. 
Dream by dream.

We all have dreams.
To be a lawyer. A doctor.
A champion. To finish school. Own a
business. Raise a family.
   It's when those dreams take hold
and begin to inspire us, drive us and
lead us to new levels of achievement
that they become real.
  We should know.
   Because the same kind of
imagination, dedication and 
perspiration that builds dreams, also
builds businesses like ours. 
   And it's those same qualities that
will build a better future for all of us.
   Dream by dream.

Mrs. Parks was born on February
4, 1913 in Tuskegee, Alabama. Her family was to later move to
Montgomery where she attended the Montgomery Industrial
School for Girls. There among others, she learned the art of
tailoring and dressmaking. In 1931, Rosa married Raymond
Parks. They were both interested and active in voter registration
and civil rights pursuits long before the work of this kind was
engaged to any great extent on a general basis.
Mr. Parks himself, an early
participant in the national movement to free 'Scottsboro
Boys' a celebrated case of injustice in the 1930's. The two of
them worked in the NAACP and other programs directed toward
obtaining freedom and justice for all people. Mrs. Parks was
Secretary and Director of Youth Activities for the Montgomery
branch. At the time of her arrest, she had been involved with
preparations for a major State Youth Conference.
Today, Mrs. Parks continues on the
course she originally chose those many years ago. Quietly,
unassuming and dignified, she works with and encourages the
youth. She has criss-crossed America over a dozen times - 
appearing at schools, colleges, churches, civic groups and
organizations; hoping to spread love, and understanding. She
believes that America's hope lies with its young people.

TONY BROWN
TELEVISION'S CIVIL
RIGHTS CRUSADER

Called television's ""civil
rights crusader"" by Black
Enterprise magazine,
Tony Brown is one of America's leading experts in the broadcasting
industry, and a pioneer in Black-Affairs. This writer,
lecturer, educator and community activities is most noted as
the Host and Executive Producer of Tony Brown's Journal, the
nation's longest-running national Black-Affairs television
series. Tony Brown is also renowned for his tenure as the Host
and Executive Producer of the legendary, Emmy-nominated
BLACK JOURNAL.
In its 17th year, Brown's series is
seen weekly nationwide on more than 240 public television
stations (PBS). The most recent ratings survey showed that
about 5 million Americans tune in to him each week.
Although the program is the leading Black public affairs
series, 60 percent of his audience is white, a barometer of his
feeling for racial relations.
During a previous four-year tenure
on commercial television, an A.C. Neilsen Report on Syndicated
Programming showed that the series was America's top-ranked
talk/educational program and that a higher percentage
of non-Whites watches the series than watched the network's
three major public affairs shows.
Brown's current clearance to 96
percent of the Black population and 90 percent of the total

Bill Wilkerson

Bill Wilkerson is in his 
second decade of broadcasting,
all of which
has been spent at KMOX Radio. During that time, Wilkerson
has worked virtually every phase of the news and sports operation.
He began in 1969 as a weekend overnight news writer, 
then moved to on-the-street reporting. Wilkerson's news
career expanded rapidly to encompass the evening newcast,
co-hosting of the popular AT YOUR SERVICE program, and
coverage of special news events such as the 1972 Democratic
and Republican Presidential Conventions, and a series of local
and state elections.
Beginning in 1973, Wilkerson
began a move into the sports department while still a full-time
newsman. He began color commentary on the St. Louis Football
Cardinals that year, then added Spirits of St. Louis Pro
Basketball in 1974. In 1976, Missouri Tiger Football joined
the list of duties as well as full-time duty as co-host of
SPORT OPEN LINE.
In 1981, Wilkerson's sportscasting
career took an exciting turn as he moved into play-by-play
coverage of the Football Cardinals and Missouri Tigers. And in
1982, the circle was complete as he was tapped to fill the role
of co-host of one of the nation's highest-rated radio programs,
TOTAL INFORMATION A.M.
Wilkerson is the recipient of 
numerous citations in broadcasting including the 1979 Journalism
Alumnus of the Year Award from Southern Illinois University
at Carbondale. He also holds two first-place awards in sports
reporting from the Missouri Broadcasters Association."

It is again with great pleasure
that Anheuser-Busch,
Inc., joins with the Alpha
Phi Alpha Fraternity for the Third Annual St. Louis Tribute to
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.  Through this event we seek to
highlight the importance of the life and legacy of Dr. King and
the National Holiday which recognizes him and his 
humanitarian principles.
     
We are delighted and honored to
have with us today two nationally prominent Civil Rights leaders.
They are Ms. Rosa L. Parks - the ""Mother of the Civil Rights
Movement"" - and Mr. Tony Brown, the preeminent Civil Rights
television journalist.
     
They join us here in St. Louis on
this annual occasion with which we respectfully pause to
reflect on the message of human dignity and equality that
Dr. King personified, and to re-dedicate ourselves to taking
time in our lives and in some way contribute towards the
actualization of the hopes and dreams of every man, woman
and child regardless of race, creed or color.
     
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Life and 
Legacy Awards will be presented today to U.S. Representative
William L. Clay and to the Phyllis Wheatly Y.W.C.A. for their
outstanding community service and exemplary dedication to
making St. Louis a community of moral strength and one fortified
with the highest standards of human equality.
     
With the St. Louis community and
the Alpha Phi Alpha chapters represented here today,
Anheuser-Busch welcomes our special guests and we salute
the award recipients.

Larry Goodwin,
President 
Epsilon Lambda Chapter

On behalf of the more than
100,000 men of Alpha Phi
Alpha Fraternity, Inc.,
it is my most sincere pleasure to greet you and to congratulate
the St. Louis Alpha Chapters and the Anheuser-Busch Company
on their sponsorship of the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Tribute.
We rejoice, as do you, in this nation's recognition - however
belated and reluctant - of the contributions of this outstanding
American to the fibre and fabric of our entire society.
     
As Alpha men, we were fortunate
to enjoy a unique and gratifying relationship with this distinguished
leader of men.  To us, he was a Brother... and the
strength of that fraternal bond provided to us an unparalleled
opportunity to advance our work as ""Servants of All.""  Under
the dynamic leadership of former General President Frank
Stanley, Jr., who traveled to Montgomery to stand with
Brother King in his darkest hour, Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity
took its stand on behalf of civil rights and human dignity at
an early stage in Dr. King's career.  Alpha's ""Dollars for Freedom""
campaign in the mid-1950's provided much-needed
financial support to the work of our Brothers in Alabama -
among them Dr. King.  Arthur Shores and Charles Langford.
Again, we do not merely boast of this fact - but are grateful
for having had the privilege to link arms with our own in the
service of all mankind.
     
As we come together here tonight,
in celebration of the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King,
Jr., let me assure you that Alpha Phi Alpha plans to give continued
leadership to the quest for full civil and human rights.
This quest will require renewed determination, renewed dedication
to lofty purposes and renewed creativity in the formulation
of strategy.  Fortunately for us all, the indomitable spirit
of Brother King remains a beacon light to guide us through
the continuing struggle.

Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
was born January 15,
1929 in Atlanta. Both his
father  ""Daddy King"" and grandfather were distinguished Baptist
ministers. After completing Morehouse College, which he entered at
age 15, Dr. King enrolled at Crozer Theological Seminary. He later
attended Boston University where he obtained his Ph.D. His doctoral
thesis was ""A Comparison of the Conceptions of God in the
Thinking of Paul Tillich and Henry Nelson Wieman."" 
In Boston, he met Coretta Scott, who
became his wife. They are the parents of two daughters, Yolanda
and Bernice, and two sons, Martin III and Dexter.
It was also in Boston where he was
initiated into the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity in June of 1952
through the Fraternity's Sigma Chapter. He was very active in the 
Fraternity throughout the Civil Rights Movement.
The years of Dr. King's greatest success
were from 1956 in Montgomery, Alabama to the 1963 March on 
Washington, D.C.
His initial activity was with the 1955
Montgomery bus boycott, which was touched off when seamstress
Rosa Parks refused to give up her front seat to a white person. Dr.
King said Mrs. Parks had been tracked down by Zeitgeist - the spirit
of the times. Her own explanation, however, was that she was tired
from shopping and her feet hurt.
The boycott activity was 
coordinated by an organization
called the Montgomery
Improvement Association of which Dr. King was the president.
Utilizing a well organized car pool system to transport participants in
the bus boycott, the boycott lasted more than a year. On November
13, 1956, the United States Supreme Court affirmed the decision of
a special three-judge U.S. District Court in declaring the Alabama's
state and local laws requiring segregation on buses as ""unconstitutional.""
This was the victory from which he launched the non-violent 
Civil Rights Movement. Immediately after, the Montgomery
bus boycott idea spread to other Southern cities such as Tallahassee
and Atlanta. In Greensboro, N.C., non-violent activity was also conducted
to eradicate segregation in restaurants.
In January of 1957, sixty black leaders,
most of them ministers from ten Southern states, founded the

1929-1968
Southern Christina Leadership Conference (SCLC), which was eventually
to be headquartered in Atlanta. Dr. King was elected as the
national president of the organization, a position from which he
became a national leader.
The 1963 March on Washington was
an unprecedented gathering of black and white leaders and more
than 250,000 marchers who demonstrated for Civil Rights.
On July 2, 1964, the Civil
Rights Bill of 1964 was
passed into law by Congress,
although the legislation actually had been sent to Congress in 1963
by President John F. Kennedy. It was the most far-reaching Civil
Rights legislation since Reconstruction. It contained new provisions
to help guarantee blacks the right to vote and access to public
accommodations such as hotels, motels, restaurants and places of
entertainment. It also authorized the federal government to sue to
desegregate public facilities and schools.
On December 10, 1964, Dr. King
received the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo, Norway. He became the
second Black American to receive the award. The first was Ralph
Bunche in 1950.
Another direct result of the March on
Washington, was the 1965 Voting Rights Act. This bill eliminated all 
qualifying tests for voter registration in the South, which abridged
the right to vote on the basis of race and color. Soon after the bill
was passed, tens of thousands of blacks were registered to vote and
black men and women were elected to new posts in legislatures
and the county court houses of the South for the first time since
Reconstruction.
During the Civil Rights movement,
Dr. King received one dollar a year from the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference and $6,000 a year from the Ebenezer Baptist
Church in Atlanta. He donated the $54,123 awarded to him with
the Nobel Peace Prize to Civil Rights activities. Dr. King's efforts
were also augmented by contributions from the Alpha Phi Alpha
Fraternity.
Dr. King was assassinated in Memphis 
on April 4, 1968 where he was supporting a sanitation workers'
strike. His death set off riots in 125 cities that led to 21,270 arrests
and 46 deaths.

Rosa Parks
ROSA PARKS, known as the ""Mother of the Civil Rights 
Movement"", was a seamstress and an administrator in the Alabama
NAACP office who resisted discrimination.  In 1955, she was arrested 
and jailed for refusing to give up her seat to a white man 
on a Montgomery, Alabama, city bus.

Reverend Martin Luther King along with E. D. Nixon, the
president of the state NAACP and regional director of the International
Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters organized a bus
boycott which lasted 381 days.  Their efforts combined with the 
determination of 50,000 blacks who decided to walk, brought
transportation to a cease in the city until the buses were integrated.

Ms. Parks actions against discrimination sparked 12 years of 
non-violent protest against segregation throughout Southern cities.
Ms. Rosa Parks was referred to as the ""Great fuse that led the 
modern stride toward freedom"", by Martin Luther King.

Lift every voice and sing,
'Till earth and heaven ring,
Ring with the harmonies of Liberty.
Let our rejoicing rise,
High as the list'ning skies,
Let it re-sound loud as the roll-ing sea—

Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past
has taught us
Sing a song full of the hope that the present has 
brought us;

Fa-cing the rising sun of our new day begun,
Let us march on till victory is won.

Stony the road we trod,
Bitter the chast'ning rod,
Felt in the days when hope un-born—had died;
Yet with a steady beat,
Have not our weary feet
Come to the place for which our fathers sighed?
We have come over a way that with tears has 
been watered
We have come, treading our path thro' the 
blood of the slaughtered, 
Out from the gloomy past, till now we stand 
at last.

Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast.

God of our weary years,
God of our silent tears,
Thou who has brought us thus far on our way;
Thou who has by Thy might,
Lead us into the light, Keep us forever in the 
path, we pray—

Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, 
where we met Thee;
Lest our hearts, drunk with the wine of the 
world, we forget Thee;
Shadowed beneath Thy hand, may we forever 
stand
True to our God, True to our native land.

Mrs Rosa Parks' refusal to surrender her seat on a bus 
as required by racial segregation laws in Montgomery, 
Alabama, triggered a wave of protest that reverberated 
throughout the United States. Her quiet and courageous act 
changed the face of America as it viewed Black people and 
redirected the course of history.
Born on February 4, 1913 in Tuskegee, Alabama, her 
family moved to Montgomery and she attended the 
Montgomery Industrial School for Girls. In 1932, she married 
Raymond Parks and they both became active in voter 
registration and other civil rights pursuits.
Mrs Parks was secretary of the Montgomery branch of 
the NAACP and Director of Youth Activities. She was 
preparing for a major NAACP youth conference at the time of 
her arrest for failing to surrender her bus seat.
Mrs Parks continues to pursue the course that she 
initially took those many years ago—quiet, unassuming and 
dignified while working with youth. She believes the hope 
of America lies with its young people.
A quiet exemplification of courage, dignity and 
determination, Rosa Louise Parks will ever be a symbol of 
all Americans' will to be and remain free.

1. Lift every voice and sing
Till Earth and Heaven ring
Ring with the harmonies of liberty:
Let our rejoicing rise

Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.
Sing a song full of the faith the dark past has taught us;
Sing a song full of hope that the present has brought us;
Facing the rising sun

Let us march on till victory is won.

2. Stony the road we trod
Bitter in the chastening rod.
Felt in the days when hope unborn has died;
Yet with a steady beat
Have not our weary feet
Come to that place for which our fathers died.
We have come over a way that with fears has been watered,
We have been treading our path thru the blood of the slaughtered;
Out from the gloomy past
Till now we stand at last where the
Bright gleam of our bright star is cast

3. God of our weary years,
God of our silent tears.
Thou who has brought us thus far on our way
Thou who hast by thy might
Led us into the light
Keep us forever in thy path, we pray;
Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met thee.
Lest our hearts, drunk with the wine of the world, we forget thee;
Shadowed beneath thy hand,
May we forever stand,
True to our God, true to our native land."

1955, that reverberated throughout the United States.  Her quiet, courageous act changed
America, its view of black people and redirected the course of history.

Mrs. Parks was born Rosa Louise McCauley, February 4, 1913 in Tuskegee, Alabama. She
was the first child of James and Leona Edwards McCauley. Her brother, Sylvester
McCauley, now deceased, was born August 20, 1915.  Later, the family moved to Pine Level,
Alabama where Rosa was reared and educated in the rural school.

When she completed her education in Pine Level at age eleven, her mother, Leona, enrolled
her in Montgomery Industrial School for Girls (Miss White's School for Girls), a private
institution. After finishing Miss White's School, she went to Alabama State Teacher's
College High School. However, she was unable to graduate with her class because of the
illness of her grandmother Rose Edwards and later her death.

As Rosa prepared to return to Alabama State, her mother also became ill. Therefore, she
continued to take care of their home and care for her mother while her brother Sylvester,
worked outside of the home. Rosa received her high school diploma in 1934, after her 
marriage to Raymond Parks, December 18, 1932.

Raymond, now deceased, born in Wedowee, Alabama, Randolph County, February 12 1903,
received little formal education due to racial segregation. He was a self educated person with
the assistance of his mother, Geri Parks. His immaculate dress and his thorough knowledge
of domestic affairs and current events made most think he was college educated. He supported and encouraged Rosa's desire to complete her formal education.

Mr. Parks was an early activist in the effort to free the ""Scottsboro Boys,"" a celebrated case
in the 1930's.  Together, Raymond and Rosa worked in the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People (NAACP's) programs. He was an active member and she
served as secretary and later youth leader of the local branch. At the time of her arrest, she
was preparing for a major youth conference.

After the arrest of Rosa Parks, black people of Montgomery and sympathizers of other races
organized and promoted a boycott of the city bus line that lasted 381 days. Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr. was appointed the spokesperson for the Bus Boycott and taught non-violence
to all participants. Contingent with the protest in Montgomery, others took shape
throughout the south and the country. They took form as sit-ins, eat-ins, swim-ins and
similar causes. Thousands of courageous people joined the ""protest"" to demand equal rights
for all people.

Since 1965, Mrs. Parks has been employed by Congressman John Conyers, First
Congressional District of Michigan.  In February, 1987, she began the Rosa and Raymond
Parks Institute for Self Development. The purpose is to motivate and direct the ""average"" 
youth not targeted by other programs to achieve their highest potential. Rosa Parks sees the
energy of young people as a real force for change. It is among her most treasured themes of
human priorities as she speaks to young people of all ages at schools, colleges and national
organizations around the county.

Mrs. Parks has received ten honorary doctorate degrees, hundreds of plaques, certificates,
citations, awards, and keys to several cities. Among them are the NAACP's Spingarn Medal,
the UAW's Social Justice Award, the Martin Luther King, Jr. Non-Violent Peace Prize and
most recently in May of 1987, the Roger Joseph Prize with a cash award of ten thousand
dollars, from the Hebrew Union College.
A quiet exemplification of courage, dignity and determination; Rosa Parks is a symbol to all
Americans to remain free."

Regional Office of the U.S. General Accounting Office to 
conclude its Black History Month Program and commemorate 
Women's History Month by honoring today the ""Mother of the 
Civil Rights Movement"", Mrs. Rosa Louise Parks.

A recent article in the Detroit Free Press, ""A Legacy 
Of Inspiration"", praised Mrs. Parks for her singular 
courage for refusing to give up her seat on a Montgomery, 
Alabama city bus to accommodate a white male passenger. 
Her subsequent arrest and conviction for violating a city 
ordinance which permitted segregated buses, led to the 
historic Montgomery Bus Boycott and the ascension into 
international prominence of the boycott's spokesman, Dr. 
Martin Luther King. 

Mrs. Parks' successful appeal of her conviction 
resulted in a landmark 1956 U.S. Supreme Court ruling 
reversing an 1896 court decision, Plessy vs. Ferguson 
which had relegated Black Americans to separate but 
unequal status in America. It is significant to note that 
the national and international support she received 
included people from every race, women and men, young and 
old, the rich as well as the poor. Mrs. Parks became and 
continues to be a symbol of humanity's constant struggle 
to improve the quality of life for all people.

Although Mrs. Parks recently celebrated her 76th 
birthday, she is still active in civic affairs and her 
attention is now focused on young people. Through the 
Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development, she 
hopes to provide greater opportunities for the ""average"" 
youth that are often overlooked by other programs. We, too, 
have a responsibility to developing America's youth. 
Toward that end, it is our pleasure to welcome Mrs. Parks' 
thoughts on the subject today, as the Detroit Regional 
Office of the U.S. General Accounting Office concludes its 
Black History Month Program and commemorates Women's 
History Month.

Prominent Civil
Rights Figure
To Visit Wayne
County Area
by Paul Weaver
More than 30 years ago,
Rosa Parks took a bus ride
that was to have a dramatic
effect on the nation's civil
rights movement. Later this
month, she will be in
Wayne County to speak in
person to those attending
the Annual Freedom Fund
Dinner, sponsored by the
Wooster/Orrville Branch of
the National Association
for the Advancement of
Colored People.
Rosa Parks
The freedom fund dinner
will be held on Saturday,
Oct. 28, at 6:30 p.m. at
Wayne General & Technical
College, in the John E.
Boyer Gymnasium, 10470
Smucker Rd., Orrville.
Parks is well remembered
for her refusal to give up
her seat on a Montgomery,
Alabama bus to a white
male passenger, and her
subsequent arrest. She has
since then been dubbed as
the ""Mother of the Modern
Day Civil Rights Movement""
in the United States.
Over the years, Parks has
done much work with the
NAACP, focusing much of
her attention on the needs
of young people. In 1987,
she established the Rosa
and Raymond Parks Institute
for Self Development.
She has spoken nationally
at schools, colleges and organizations.
Parks has been
the recipient of 10 honorary
doctorate degrees, as well as
numerous certificates,
plaques and awards.
The local NAACP
branch, of which Ronald
Hill is president, has been
holding an annual dinner
since the 1960s. Chairing
this year's event is Lydia
Thompson, publicity director
of the branch and a
member of the Wooster
City School Board.
The theme for the dinner,
notes Thompson, will be
Remembering the Past and
Reaching for the Future.
""The freedom fund dinner is
for everyone,"" she stresses.
In the past, a wide assortment
of people have attended
the dinners, with an
average attendance of about
200.
This year, with the
prominence of Parks as the
keynote speaker, she hopes
to have 1,000 individuals
present. ""She is nationally
known, and is known as the
mother of the modern day
civil rights movement,""
says Thompson. ""She did
not give up her seat on the
bus so that we could all
stand up for freedom and
opportunities for all.""
Parks will arrive on Friday,
Oct. 27, in time for a
4 p.m. press conference at
the Wayne Center for the
Arts, located on Walnut
Street in Wooster. At 7:30
p.m., a reception will be
held at the Wooster Community
Center on Bever
Street.
Tickets for the dinner can
be purchased through Oct.
21 at $25 per person. For

Guests at the meeting of the Wayne County Peace Coalition on 
Saturday included Joseph Kufchak and Allison Schmidt.  Kufchak 
talked on behalf of Action for Peace in Central American and The 
College of Wooster Students for Peace With Action.  He announced a 
special showing of the video ""El Salvador in Crisis"" which will be 
shown tonight at 7:30 p.m. in the Lean Lecture Room on the college 
campus.  Kufchak also circulated a letter to The Daily Record urging 
further negotiations to end the bloodshed in El Salvador.
Schmidt, member of the education department at the college, 
made a presentation in support of the 6.8 mill tax levy, Issue 20 on 
the November ballot.  The levy will go toward improving instruction 
in the elementary schools of Wooster.
The coalition voted a contribution for the Wooster-Orrville 
NAACP in support of the visit to the area by Rosa Parks, who began 
the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s when she refused to take a 
seat in the back of a bus.  Her visit will include a reception, dinner 
and lecture during the weekend of Oct. 27-28.
Helen Osgood reported on a recent visit to Washington, D.C. to 
attend festivities in celebration of the final year of construction of the 
Washington Cathedral.
Osgood read from a brochure about the cathedral which pointed 
out that ""no federal, state, municipal or church funds have gone into 
its construction or operation.""  The cathedral has ""been built and 
supported entirely by gifts"" from people throughout the world ""who 
have shared the vision of a national cathedral serving the members of 
all faith traditions.""
An invitation from SANE-FREEZE Education Foundation to 
attend a two-day media workshop at Case Western Reserve 
University on Oct. 28 and 29 was discussed.  The workshop was 
initiated by Cuyahoga County Concerned Citizens.

Wayne County Peace Coalition
Wayne County Peace Coalition welcomed Ron Hill, president of 
the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of 
Colored People, to its regular meetings n Saturday.  Hill announced 
that a ""Silent March"" sponsored by the national organization of the 
NAACP will take place in Washington, D.C. on Saturday, Aug. 26.  
The purpose of the march is to call attention to the recent Supreme 
Court rulings against the gains in civil rights which were achieved in 
the U.S. during the 1950's and '60's.
Mr. Hill also described plans for a ""Black Dollar Days"" which 
will be held in Wooster between Sept. 1-4.  This event will call 
attention to the economic significance of blacks in this community.  
According to the 1980 census, 591 blacks were living in Wooster.  The 
new census will show an increase in the local black population.
Of particular interest to those attending the coalition meeting 
was Mr. Hill's announcement of the coming visit of the ""Mother of 
the Modern Day Civil Rights Movement,"" Mrs. Rosa Louise Parks.  
She will be speaking in the John Boyer Gymnasium at Wayne 
General Technical College on Oct. 28.
Members of the coalition who participated in the Hiroshima-Nagasaki 
Commemoration on the Public Square in Wooster during 
the regular noon vigil on Friday, Aug. 4, reported on the character 
and response to the vigil. There was also discussion of plans to 
participate in the United Way Parade.
Next meeting will be Aug. 26 at the Wayne County Public 
Library.

Mother of Civil Rights Movement 
Will Speak At Local NAACP Event
By. E.E. JOHNSON
Staff Writer
A generation ago, an act of courage by Rosa 
Parks provided the spark to ignite America's 
modern civil rights movement - she refused to 
give up her seat on a Montgomery, Ala. bus to a 
white male passenger.
This year, the Wooster Branch of the NAACP 
hopes that Parks' presence in Wayne County will 
help spark renewed interest in the local work of the 
National Association for the Advancement of Colored 
People.
The 76-year-old woman acclaimed as the mother 
of the civil rights movement will be the featured 
speaker at the NAACP's annual Freedom Fund 
dinner, scheduled for Oct. 28 at Wayne College in 
Orrville.
Freedom Fund dinner chairman Lydia Thompson 
said that Parks has already accepted the 
Wooster branch's invitation to be the keynote 
speaker for its Saturday evening event.  She said 
that plans also are being made for a reception 
honoring Parks on Friday evening and a press 
conference prior to the dinner.
Individual tickets for the event will be $25 each, 
Thompson said, and letters will be sent to area 
businesses and industries asking them to support 
the NAACP's local efforts by purchasing dinner 
tickets for distribution to area students.
She said that between 800 and 1,000 dinner guests 
are expected from as far away as Cleveland and 
Columbus.  Final plans will be announced as soon as 
the details are worked out, Thompson aid.
Rosa Parks became famous virtually overnight

after refusing to surrender her bus 
seat on Dec. 1, 1955.  That simple 
act triggered a wave of protest that 
swept across the United States four 
days later.
Her husband, the late Raymond 
Parks, was an early activist in the 
effort to free the Scottsboro Boys in 
the 1930s.
Husband and wife worked together 
in their local NAACP branch's 
program and Rosa Parks was preparing 
for a major youth conference 
at the time of her arrest in 
1955.
After her arrest, black people of 
Montgomery and sympathizers of 
other races organized and promoted 
a boycott of the city bus line 
that lasted more than a year.
The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. 
was appointed spokesman for the 
boycott and his teachings of non-violence 
led eventually to his being 
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
She retired last year after 23 
years in the employ of U.S. Rep. 
John Conyers, D-Mich.  In February 
1987 she founded the Rosa and 
Raymond Parks Institute for Self 
Development, to motivate and direct 
""average"" youth not targeted 
by other programs to reach their 
highest potential.
Parks has been awarded the 
Spingarn Medal, the NAACP's 
highest award, and the Martin Luther 
King Jr. Non-Violent Peace 
Prize.  She has received 10 honorary 
doctorates and hundreds of other 
plaques, certificates, citations and 
awards.

CONCEPT AND MISSION OF THE BROTHERHOOD CRUSADE 
OF 
SAN DIEGO

The Brotherhood Crusade, founded in 1968, is a non-profit tax-exempt 
organization which has been built on the philosophy of concern and 
compassionate giving in Black and other minority communities throughout 
Southern California is unprecedented in the history of these communities.

The primary mission of the Brotherhood Crusade is to assist in building quality educational, heath, social economic and cultural programs in the community 
that do not ""qualify"" for one reason or other for funding for start-up 
sustenance and/or expansion purposes from the traditional funding sources, 
i.e., the United Way of America, federal, state or city funding sources, 
private financial institutions, etc.

The Brotherhood Crusade has demonstrated its capability to be acutely aware and 
responsive to the myriad of problems that exists in these communities and has 
acted as a catalyst to collect and distribute much needed monies for the 
revitalization and growth of our community.

It is for this and many other reasons that a group of concerned community 
activists in San Diego are in the process of developing a local chapter of the 
Brother Crusade.  Our mission in San Diego mirrors that of Los Angeles and rest 
of the country.  However, there are some elements and crisis in our community 
that our underfunded and underserved.  The gang and drugs problem, the hunger problem, teenage pregnancy and the plight of the homeless, are a few of the 
problems that aren't being addressed sufficiently.  With caring, sharing and 
work, the Brotherhood Crusade can and will fill this void.

In order for our mission to become a reality, we must look to ourselves and 
friends of the Black community.  That is why we're asking the gainfully 
employed amongst us to give their charitable donation to the Brotherhood 
Crusade.  To this end, we're working with the City, County and other 
governmental agencies and private business to become part of their payroll 
deduction process.  We are also planning at least one large fundraising event 
yearly.

If we as a group and community can help solve some of our social ills our time 
and purpose will be well served.  But probably just as important is the 
demonstration of our growth and our will to determine our own destiny.

Regional Office of the U.S. General Accounting Office to 
conclude its Black History Month Program and commemorate 
Women's History Month by honoring today the ""Mother of the
Civil Rights Movement"", Mrs. Rosa Louise Parks.

A recent article in the Detroit Free Press, ""A Legacy 
Of Inspiration"", praised Mrs. Parks for her singular 
courage for refusing to give up her seat on a Montgomery, 
Alabama city bus to accommodate a white male passenger. 
Her subsequent arrest and conviction for violating a city 
ordinance which permitted segregated buses, led to the 
historic Montgomery Bus Boycott and the ascension into 
international prominence of the boycott's spokesman, Dr. 
Martin Luther King.

Mrs. Parks' successful appeal of her conviction 
resulted in a landmark 1956 U.S. Supreme Court ruling
reversing an 1896 court decision, Plessy vs. Ferguson 
which had relegated Black Americans to separate but 
unequal status in America.  It is significant to note that
the national and international support she received 
included people from every race, women and men, young and 
old, the rich as well as the poor. Mrs. Parks became and 
continues to be a symbol of humanity's constant struggle 
to improve the quality of life for all people.

Although Mrs. Parks recently celebrated her 76th
birthday, she is still active in civic affairs and her
attention is now focused on young people.  Through the
Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development, she
hopes to provide greater opportunities for the ""average""
youth that are often overlooked by other programs.  We,
too, have a responsibility to developing America's youth.
Toward that end, it is our pleasure to welcome Mrs. Parks'
thoughts on the subject today, as the Detroit Regional
Office of the U.S. General Accounting Office concludes its
Black History Month Program and commemorates Women's
History Month.

Regional Manager



A LIVING LEGACY
ROSA PARKS
Mrs. Rosa Parks is nationally recognized
as the Mother of the Modern Civil Rights
Movement in America.  Her refusal to
surrender her seat on a Montgomery,
Alabama bus in December, 1955, triggered
a wave of protest that reverberated
throughout the United States.

The arrest of Mrs. Parks sparked a
boycott of the city bus line that lasted
over a year.  Dr. Martin Luther King,
Jr. was appointed the spokesperson for
the boycott and taught non-violence to
all participants.  Thousands of people
joined the protest throughout the
country which took the form of sit-ins,
eat-ins, swim-ins and similar causes.
Mrs. Parks quiet, courageous act changed
America and redirected the course of
history.

In 1987, Mrs. Parks began the ""Rosa and
Raymond Parks Institute for Self
Development"".  The purpose is to
motivate and direct the ""average youth""
not targeted by other programs to
achieve their highest potential.  Mrs.
Parks sees the energy of young people as
a real force for change, and is
dedicated to improving choices and 
chances for the youth of today."

Special thanks to:
Mrs. Rosa Parks played no less a significant role in Dr. 
King's Dream for the acquisition of civil rights in the 
United States - for Justice and Peace amongst all peoples. 
Mrs. Parks was that lady from the north who refused to go 
to the back of the bus when ordered by the Police in 
Montgomery, Alabama. Some historians may view her actions 
as the turning point of the Civil Rights Movement at that 
time. Mrs. Parks is presently the President of the 
Raymond and Rosa Parks Institute (for self improvement).

BATTLE HYMN OF REPUBLIC
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming
of the Lord;
he is trampling out the vintage where the 
grapes of wrath are stored;
he hath loosed the fateful lighting of 
his terrible swift sword,
his truth is marching on.

Refrain: Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!
His truth is marching on!

He hath sounded forth the trumpet that shall 
never call retreat;
He is sifting out the hearts of men before 
his judgement seat,
O be swift, my soul, to answer him;
be jubilant, my feet!
Our God is marching on!

In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born 
across the sea,
with a glory in his bosom that transfigures 
you and me;
as he died to make men holy, let us live to 
make men free,
while God is marching on!

He is coming like the glory of the morning 
on the wave;
he is wisdom to the mighty, he is succour 
to the brave;
so the world shall be his footstool, and the 
soul of time his slave:
our God is marching on!

Hymn

A MIGHTY FORTRESS IS OUR GOD
A mighty fortress is our God,
A bulwark never failing;
Our helper He amid the flood,
Of mortal ills prevailing;
For still our ancient foe,
Doth seek to work us woe;
His craft and power are great,
And armed with cruel hate,
On earth is not His equal.

Did we in our own strength confide,
Our striving would be losing;
Were not the right Man on our side,
The Man of God's own choosing;
Dost ask who that may be?
Christ Jesus, it is He;
Lord Sabaoth His name,
From age to age the same,
And he must win the battle.

And though this world, with devils filled,
Should threaten to undo us;
We will not fear, for Goth hath willed,
His truth to triumph through us;
The prince of darkness grim,
We tremble not for him;
His rage we can endure,
For lo! his doom is sure,
One little word shall fell him.

That word above all earthly powers,
No thanks to them, abideth:
The spirit and the gifts are ours,
Through Him who with us sideth:
Let goods and kindred go,
This mortal life also:
The body they may kill,
God's truth abideth still,
His kingdom is forever.   Amen.

Lead: O give thanks unto the Lord, for He is good,
because His mercy endureth forever.
Cong: I called upon the Lord in distress: the Lord
answered me, and set me in a large place.
Lead: The Lord is on my side, I will not fear: what can
man do unto me?
Cong: The Lord taketh my part with them that help me:
therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate
me.
Lead: It is better to trust in the Lord than to put
confidence in man.
Cong: It is better to trust in the Lord than to put
confidence in princes.
Lead: All nations compassed me about, but in the name of
the Lord will I destroy them.
Cong: They compassed me about like bees: they are quenched
as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the Lord
I will destroy them.
Lead: Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall,
but the Lord helped me.

the Lord doeth valiantly.
Cong: The right hand of the Lord is exalted: the right
hand of the Lord doeth valiantly.
Lead: I shall not die, but live, and declare the works
of the Lord.
Cong: The Lord hath chastened me sore: but He hath not
given me over unto death.

enter.

the Holy Ghost:

AFFIRMATION OF FAITH  (all)  (said)
We believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker
of heaven and earth, of all that is, seen and unseen.
We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only Son of God,
eternally begotten of the Father, God from God, Light 
from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made, of
one being with the Father. Through Him all things were
made.  For us and our salvation He came down from heaven:
by the power of the Holy Spirit He became incarnate from
the Virgin Mary, and was made man.  For our sake He was
crucified under Pontius Pilate:  He suffered death and
was buried.  On the third day He rose again in accordance
with the Scriptures:  He ascended into heaven and is
seated at the right hand of the Father.  He will come
again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and His
kingdom will have no end.

We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,
who proceeds from the Father and the Son.  With the Father
and the Son He is worshipped and glorified.  He has spoken
through the Prophets.  We believe in one holy catholic and
apostolic Church.  We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness
of sins.  We look for the resurrection of the dead,
and the life of the world to come.       Amen.

MY GOD, HOW WONDERFUL THOU ART

My God, how wonderful Thou art,
Thy majesty how bright!
How beautiful Thy mercy seat.
In Depths of burning light!

How dread are Thine eternal years,
O everlasting Lord,
By prostrate spirits day and night
Incessantly adored!


How beautiful, how beautiful
The sight of Thee must be,
Thine endless wisdom, boundless power,
and awful purity!

O How I fear Thee, living God
With deepest, tenderest fears,
And worship Thee with trembling hope
And penitential tears!

Yet I may love Thee, too, O Lord,
Almighty as Thou art,
For Thou hast stooped to ask of me
The love of my poor heart.

Father of Jesus, love's reward,
What rapture will it be
Prostrate before Thy throne to lie,
And gaze and gaze on Thee!

Whene'er we hear that glorious word:

REFRAIN: Faith of our Fathers, holy faith!

Our fathers, chained in prison dark,
Were still in heart and conscience free,

DOMINE REFUGIUM (ALL) said 
Min:   Lord, thou hast been our refuge, from one 
          generation to another, 
Cong: Before the mountains were brought forth, or 
           ever the earth and the world were made: thou 
           art God everlasting, and world without 
           end. 
Min:    Thou turnest man to destruction: again thou 
           sayest, Come again, ye children of men. 
Cong: For a thousand years in thy sight are but as 
          yesterday: seeing that is past as a watch 
          in the night,  
Min:   As soon as thou scatterest them, they are even 
          as a sleep: and fade away suddenly like the 
          grass. 
Cong: In the morning it is green and groweth up: 
          but in the evening it is cut down, dried up 
          and withered. 
Min:   For we consume away in thy displeasure, and 
          are afraid at thy wrathful indignation. 
Cong: Thou hast set our misdeeds before thee, and 
          our secret sins in the light of thy count-
          enance.  
Min:   For when thou art angry all our days are gone: 
          we bring our years to an end, as it were a 
          tale that is told 
Cong: The days of our age are threescore years and 
          ten: and though men be so strong, that they 
          come to fourscore years: yet is their 
          strength then but labour and sorrow: so soon 
          it passeth away, and we are gone. 
Min:   But who regardeth the power of thy wrath: 
          for even thereafter as a man feareth, so 
          is thy displeasure. 
Cong: So teach us to number our days, that we may 
          apply our hearts unto wisdom. 
Min:   Turn thee again, O Lord, at the last: and be 
          gracious unto thy servants. 
Cong: O satisfy us with thy mercy, and that soon; 
          so shall we rejoice and be glad all the days 
          of our life. 
Min:   Comfort us again now after the time that thou 
          has plagued us: and for the years wherein 
          we have suffered adversity. 

Cong: Shew thy servants thy work, and their
          children thy glory. 
Min:   And the glorious majesty of the Lord our God 
          be upon us: prosper thou the work of our 
          hands upon us, O prosper thou the handi-work,

PRAYER OF CONFESSION (all)
Most merciful God, we confess that we have sinned 
against thee in thought, word and deed: for we 
have done those things which we ought not to have 
done, and have left undone those things which we 
ought to have done: we have not loved thee with our 
whole hearts: we have not loved our neighbors as 
ourselves.  We are truly sorry, and we do humbly 
repent: stretch forth the hand of thy majesty and 
save us.  For the sake of thy son our Lord and 
Saviour, Jesus Christ, have mercy upon us and 
forgive us that we may delight in thy will and thy 
ways to the glory of your name.           Amen.

bring the laws and practices of our several

so that no Christian shall be denied membership

Processional Hymn

THY HAND, O GOD, HAS GUIDED

Thy hand, O God, has guided
thy flock from age to age;
The wondrous tale is written
full clear on every page;
Our fathers owned thy goodness,
And we their deeds record;
And both of this bear witness,
one church, one faith, one Lord.

When shadows thick were falling,
and all seemed sunk in night,
Thou, Lord, didst send thy servants,
thy chosen sons of light. 
On them and on thy people
thy plenteous grace was poured,
And this was still their message:
one church, one faith, one Lord.

And we, shall we be faithless?
Shall hearts fail, hands hang down?
Shall we evade the conflict,
and cast away our crown?
Not so; in God's deep counsels
some better thing is stored:
We will maintain unflinching
one church, one faith, one Lord.

Thy mercy will not fail us,
not leave thy work undone;
With thy right hand to help us,
the victory shall be won;
And then by men and angels
thy name shall be adored,
And this shall be their anthem:
one church, one faith, one Lord."

Benediction..............................The Right Rev. Msgr. Maurice Woulfe

There was nothing special about her birth.  The
date was important to but a few who cared.  Her
days settled quickly and imperceptively into the
routine...the repetition of events that are called
life. 

But, there was something special about the woman.
On December 1, 1955, in Montgomery, Alabama,
Rosa Parks, in the single act of refusing
to give up her seat on a segregated bus, dramatically
focused the eyes of America on injustice.

She led no demonstrations, she planned no
strategies...She acted alone, and millions of
people followed.

An ordinary woman did an extraordinary thing---
alone and unrecognized--with little thought of the
enduring impact of her act.

Rosa Parks and the WICS Volunteer of the
Year share this in common.

On December 1, 1955, Mrs. Rosa Parks, a 42-year-old tailor's assistant, boarded a bus in
Montgomery, Alabama on her way home from work.  Although Mrs. Parks had taken this
journey before, the day would not end in quite the same way.  For, when the bus driver attempted
to clear Rosa from the front row of the ""colored"" section in order to seat a white
man, she refused to move.  This small act of defiance quickly transcended the bounds of
Montgomery and ignited the controversy surrounding this nation's segregationalist policies
of the 1950's.

Twenty-five years have passed, but the effects of her action have reverberated throughout
recent history.  What at first appeared to be an infraction of local municipal law soon embroiled
an entire nation in a re-examination of de-facto prejudice that had become the 'modus
operandi' for black and white America.

It was not long after that last bus ride that consciousness and conscience were raised to
fever pitch.  Black leaders such as Drs. Martin Luther King and Ralph Abernathy forged the
machinery for an effective civil rights movement.  Yet, in light of all that has transpired since
Rosa Parks' stand, there is a need to understand and pay homage to an individual who,
before it was fashionable or legal, said NO to America's own system of apartheid.

The CREATIVE ARTS TEAM commemorates this achievement with a play entitled ROSA
PARKS: BACK OF THE BUS.  With such a theatre production we feel we can adequately present
the achievements and tragedies of this era, blending information and entertainment in an illumination
of the woman and the issues which precipitated the energy, passion and discord
in America's march toward human rights.

WHAT IS C.A.T.?

...a provocative and challenging theatre company which questions, probes, involves and,
finally, motivates personal response and action.

...a team of actors on the faculty of New York University who develop original programs
through historical investigation and ensemble improvisation.  C.A.T. is well-versed in the
concepts of drama and theatre and their potential to tap inner resources for self-discovery.

...a catalyst for thought on social and curricular issues, enriching the lives of both young
people and adults by the vitality, immediacy, and pertinence to the concerns of today's
society.

Dear Mrs. Parks:

I was delighted when Mrs. Kennan told me the she had
invited you to receive an honorary degree from Mount Holyoke
this May.

Perhaps it is out of order for me to write you in this 
way but one of my most able students, Theda Page, told me that
she had been talking to you on the telephone and that you are
still undecided about coming. Yesterday in my American history
course, I gave a lecture on the beginnings of the Civil Rights
Movement and as I got to the Montgomery story it suddenly became
clear to me how very important it would be for all of our students
to have you here at graduation.

The days in Montgomery are ancient history for these students
but I did find in the discussion after class yesterday that at
least a few of the students -- and they were both white and black
and both Northern and Southern students -- do care about the things
that concerned you so powerfully twenty-five years ago. It would
give these students an enormous sense of connection with the past
that is in some ways more hopeful than the present, if you were
to be with us on the 24th. 

I do hope that you and your friend can make the trip; it
would be an honor to have you here.

                                              Sincerely,
                                              William S. McFeely

Dear Mrs. Parks,
     
We are so eager for you to join us in May to receive the
honorary degree we spoke of in an earlier letter, but we understand
completely how difficult it may be for you to travel alone.
May we urge you, therefore, to bring with you your friend who
provides such good help and support? We will be happy to finance
transportation for both of you. 

Mrs. Durr has told me of Miss White's school where you spent
many childhood hours. A number of ""freedman schools"" in the south
were established by our own Mount Holyoke graduates; it would be
so fine if you would come here for this occasion, to make, one
might say, the circle of history complete. 

With all good wishes, and an earnest hope that I may have the
pleasure of meeting you soon, 

 Sincerely,

Elizabeth Kennan

The A.M.E. Church as an organization lays claim
to many achievements. Among them are:
1. It was the first Negro organization to own a
piece of real estate in America. In 1793 it purchased
the land at the corner of 6th and Lombard Sts., Philadelphia,
Pa., on which it later erected Bethel Church,
which church stands there today.
2. It publishes the world's oldest Negro religious
weekly, The Christian Recorder, started in 1841. 
3. It was the first Negro institution to promote,
finance, and administer a program of higher education.
Bishop Payne purchased Wilberforce University
in 1863, and after that date schools and colleges have
been established and maintained by Negroes in most
of the southern states. The establishing and maintaining
of these schools and college was the most
daring venture of all the history of American education.
4. The A.M.E. Church was the first Negro institution 
to become actually concerned enough about our
African brothers to go over and help them. Our missionary
efforts date back more than 150 years. 
5. The A.M.E Church was the first Negro institution
to enter the publishing business. We published 
the A.M.E. Discipline in 1817 and the A.M.E
Hymnal in 1818.
6. Rev. H.M. Turner, a minister in the A.M.E.
Church, was the first Negro chaplain in the U.S. 
Army. He later became a Bishop.
7. Bishop J.A. Gregg was the first Negro elected
president of Howard University, Washington, D.C.
He did not accept the position, choosing rather to
continue his work as a church leader.
8. Bishop J. A. Gregg was the first Negro leader
selected by the U.S. government to make a trip to war
areas of the Pacific, North Africa, England, and the 
Near East. He traveled 56,217 miles by airplane. 
9. Rev. J. Russell Brown, an A.M.E. minister, was
the first Negro chaplain in the U.S. Navy, appointed
in 1943.
10. Bishop R. R. Wright, Jr., has published the
biggest book ever edited and published exclusively by
Negroes.
11. William T. Vernon served as Registrar of the
U. S. Treasury under the administration of President
Theodore Roosevelt. In that position he had to sign
certain paper money of the nation. He later became a
Bishop in the A.M.E Church. 
12. William H. Heard served as U.S. Minister to
Liberia and was a member of the South Carolina
Legislature from 1880-1882. He later became a Bishop
in the A.M.E Church. 
13. Bishop S.L. Greene was the first to sign the
document bringing into being the National Council of
Churches, the most important movement in Protestant
cooperation the world has ever known. Nov. 28,
1950, Cleveland, Ohio.
14. R.H. Cain, Senator from South Carolina, 1877-
79, was a preacher in the A.M.E Church. He also 
served as president of Paul Quinn College, Waco,
Texas. Elected a Bishop from South Carolina.
15. Frederick Douglas, the great abolitionist, attended
Metropolitan A.M.E Church in Washington,
D.C. It is said that he gave the two golden candlesticks
that now stand on the pulpit of that great
church. The pew in which he sat regularly is marked
with a golden name plate. His funeral was held at
Metropolitan Church. 
16. The first Negro United States Senator was an
A.M.E Minister, Rev. Hiram Revels of Mississippi. 
DANIEL A. PAYNE
The spirit of self-help was not confined to the breast
of Richard Allen, but was spread abroad wherever Negroes
lived. It spread to South Carolina and took root
in the soul of Daniel A. Payne. Bishop Payne was the
first Negro to preside over the Ecumenical Conference
in London in 1892. 
Daniel Payne early in life recognized the value and
importance of education in the life of the Negro. 
Through his own efforts he studied, became learned
and was one of the first colored qualified teachers in
South Carolina. He was driven from South Carolina
for ""teaching Negoes too much."" He is generally
Every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the
Father ... with whom there is no variation or shadow
due to change. -James 1:17.              
-10-

OUR ECUMENICAL RELATIONSHIPS
The A.M.E Church stands on the Spiritual foundation which
Richard Allen established when he gave us the motto: GOD OUR
FATHER, CHRIST OUR REDEEMER, MAN OUR BROTHER.  This makes
our church broad enough to have spiritual fellowship with
all of God's children and liberal enough to have institutional
fellowship with all who accept Jesus Christ as Lord and
Master. Any Christian from any denomination may be accepted
into the membership of the A.M.E Church.
We gladly cooperate with other denominations in the world
wide programs of evangelism, missions, education, social
service, social reform and other programs for the advancement
of the kingdom of God. Because of this concept of our
mission we as a denomination maintain active membership and
relationship with many ecumenical movements and organizations.
Just as our churches are open to all Christians, any minister
in good standing may be invited to our pulpits. We do not
consider ourselves to be exclusive in doctrine, rites or 
authority. We recognized the Christians of other churches and
the churches of other Christians. We believe in the
Church Universal and in the universality of the Christian
religion.

AN HISTORICAL NOTE
SARAH ALLEN
Richard Allen could not have grown and matured
and become the effective leader that he was without
the love and concern and help of others. Among
those who stood with him all the way, none was more 
helpful and valuable than Sarah Allen, his beloved
wife. Neither the biography of Richard Allen nor 
the history of the A.M.E. Church can be accurately
written without giving a high and noble place of
honor to this saintly woman, Sarah Allen.
She was born in the Isle of 
Wight County, Virginia in 1764
and was brought to Philadelphia
when she was about eight years of
age. Her maiden name was Sarah 
Bass and she was united in marriage
to Richard Allen on August
18, 1801 by Rev. Ezekiel Cooper,
pastor of Old St. George Methodist
Episcopal Church, Philadelphia,
Pa. To this marriage six children
were born -- four boys and two girls.
Sarah Allen was a noble character in her own rights.
The Register Book at Old St. George Church says of 
her that she ""gave all the assistance she could to several
families, for which she did not receive anything; 
and when anything was offered her, she left it to the
option of those she served.""
She was a remarkable wife and devoted mother, and
an invaluable help to Richard Allen as he ventured
upon the daring task of organizing people of African
descent into what has eventually become the A.M.E.
Church in particular, and the Negro Church in general.
Sarah Allen was the first woman missionary in the
A.M.E. Church. Her first missionary project was to 
look after the physical condition of the preachers
whom her husband sent out on the field. Many of
them returned in very poor physical condition, and
Sarah Allen organized the women of the church to
mend their clothes and provide hot nourishing meals
when they came to make their reports.
In addition to rendering this much needed service
in the interest of the preachers, Sarah stood close by
the side of her dedicated and consecrated husband,
and encouraged him in his fight for complete freedom
for his people. She was a true and dependable
staff upon whom the Bishop could lean at anytime
and feel absolutely secure.
Mother Allen, as she is affectionately remembered,
was eighty-five years of age when she was called from 
labor to reward on July 16, 1849. Her name will ever
be associated with and endeared by the A.M.E.
Church and by the Christian Church as a whole. She
will ever remain the true Mother of African Methodism.

Gave Names to Churches
A.M.E. bishops were the first Negroes after whom
churches and educational institutions were named.
There are probably 1,000 A.M.E. churches named for
Richard Allen, Daniel Payne, Morris Brown, Edward
Waters, B. F. Lee, H. M. Turner, Paul Quinn and
other bishops.

Leaders in Education
A.M.E. bishops were the leaders in the struggle
to make education available to Negroes. Nearly every
A.M.E. Church building, beginning with Mother
Bethel in Philadelphia, Pa., founded by Richard
Allen, was a school house during week days. The first
large school building on any college campus named
for a Negro was Shorter Hall at Wilberforce University.
The first college named for a Negro was Allen
University in Columbia, S.C. The second was Morris
Brown in Atlanta, Georgia.
The first Negro Ph.D. from Harvard University
got his first job in an A.M.E. school, Wilberforce
University. His name was W.E.B. DuBois.
Bishop Daniel A. Payne almost singlehanded
founded Wilberforce University, the first effort of
Negros in America in higher education. If A.M.E.
bishops had taken their hands off, it is likely that
every one of our colleges would have failed because
our people had not yet seen the great value of education.
The first Negro man elected president of Howard
University was a bishop of the A.M.E. Church, Bishop
John A. Gregg. He did not accept, for there was no
position of influence higher than that of a bishop.

Dear Mrs. Parks:

On behalf of the Trustees of Mount Holyoke College, I have the
privilege of inviting you to receive the honorary degree of Doctor
of Humane Letters at our 144th Commencement ceremony on May 24, 1981.

Your extraordinary courage in Montgomery twenty-five years ago
has provided over the years an inspiration to all women in this
nation who would seek to right what is wrong in our society. In this
year of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the bus boycott, we would seek
to honor your remarkable leadership and to call anew the attention of
our young women now moving into the larger world to the feats of
revolution which have been possible for women in the United States.

We are writing with a similar invitation to your good friend
Virginia Durr, in the hope that she too will join us to receive an
honorary degree. At Mount Holyoke, the oldest college for women in
the country, the friendships between women and the power generated
thereby are matters of concern and interest.  You and Mrs. Durr
would do the College great honor in allowing us to celebrate your
achievements and your friendship by the conferrning of these honorary
degrees.

We would hope very much that you might come to South Hadley for
a good portion of the Commencement weekend to visit our campus at
leisure and meet with members of the Mount Holyoke community.  In
particular, we would wish you to join our Trustees and special guests
for luncheon at 1:00 p.m. on Sunday before the Commencement ceremony
begins at 3:45 in the afternoon.  You would honor me personally by
accepting an invitation to stay in my house for the duration of your
visit.

I shall look forward to hearing from you, and, if your reply is
in the affirmative, as I hope it will be, I shall appreciate knowing
how you would like your name to appear on the diploma.

Sincerely yours

Elizabeth Kennan

presence would confer special meaning on our celebration and afford
us the exceptional privilege of recognizing her courage and commitment.

Because we must confirm our plans so far in advance, it would 
be most helpful if you could respond to our request by February 23.
If you have any questions please don't hesitate to call Sara Arthur

soon as possible.

Know Your Church
By ANDREW WHITE

Richard Allen was a man of sublime courage and indestructible and passionate
faith.  Equipped with these two spiritual weapons he could not be beaten down.  When
he and others of African descent were denied the freedom to worship God in the St.
George's M. E. Church in Philadelphia, Pa. in 1787, he politely walked out into God's 
great big world and started the movement which blossomed into the African Methodist
Episcopal Church.

Richard Allen was not mastered by the disappointing and ugly experiences which 
confronted him; instead he mastered these experiences by taking a healthy attitude
toward life.  He refused to adopt a sour-grape philosophy and instead adopted a 
courageous and positive faith-filled attitude toward the problems which the people
of African descent faced.  He did not boil up; he did not blow off; he did not fret
himself because of the evil doers. He did not feel sorry for himself.  He did not be-
come impatient or irritable.  He kept his balance and his self-control.  He did not go
into a slump.  He made up his mind to do something about what had happened to
him and his people by going out immediately and starting something new--a move-
ment administered by people of African descent, which movement would recognize
""God as our Father, Christ as our Redeemer, and Man as our Brother"".

Richard Allen felt that he had a special duty to spread the gospel among Africans
and people of African descent.  These were the people who, because of segregation
and discrimination in church and state, were being dehumanized, ostracized, exploited, 
robbed, by-passed and otherwise mistreated.  They needed to be organized  and needed
to have a Christian guiding principle of action.  They needed to be encouraged
to see that they too were children of God who had rights and responsibilities.  With
these high goals and noble purposes in mind, he proceeded to take the ugly social
situation which made his movement necessary, and, like Joseph of old, use it as a 
channel of blessing which stirred up in the Afro-Americans a burning determination
to be first class Christians and first class American citizens.

The A.M.E. Church has never strayed from the course charted by Richard Allen.
The leaders of the church who succeeded him were wedded to the spiritual doctrine
of ""God Our Father, Christ Our Redeemer, Man Our Brother"".  Motivated by the far
reaching significance of this motto they led our people into fearless battles against
the enemies of human dignity and civil liberties.  Every A.M.E. Church became a
headquarters for the proclamation and the demonstration of first class Christianity
and first class American citizenship.

In an ""Address to the People of Colour"" Richard Allen pleaded with those still in 
slavery not to lose hope, but to trust in God and believe that He will make a way for
them.  He appealed to them not to hate their masters, but to fill their hearts with love
for God.  This would enable them to have the spiritual foundation for the freedom
in which Allen never lost hope.

Allen believed that, as far as the coming of freedom was concerned, much depended
on Africans themselves.  He advised those who were free not to have ill-will
for the treatment they had received as slaves.  The energy and time required for ill-
will could be most profitably used in the fight for freedom.  In concluding this im-
mortal address he said, ""I entreat you to consider the obligations we lie under to help 
forward the cause of freedom.  We who know how bitter the cup is of which the slave
hath to drink, oh, how we ought to feel for those who yet remain in bondage!""

JULIA McKENZIE

Mrs. Julia McKenzie, the youngest of twelve children was
born on October 7, 1889 to the union of Georgiana and Isom Hargrove,
in Seals, Alabama.

Julia was united in marriage, in 1910, with Mr. Clarence
McKenzie in Montgomery, Alabama and to this union six children were
born.

Mrs. McKenzie accepted Christ at a very early age and she
joined the African Methodist Episcopal Church.  She united with the 
St. John A.M.E. Church in Montgomery where she served in many capacities
and sang in the Senior Choir until she moved to Detroit, Mich.
in 1939.  Mrs. McKenzie was ordained by the A.M.E. Zion Church in
1943.

Reverend McKenzie founded the New St. James A.M.E. Church
on February 11, 1962 at 9118 12th Street with no members.  In Sep-
tember of the same year she took the Mission into the Annual Con-
ference with ten members.  Rev. McKenzie pastored the Mission until
the Annual Conference convened in August 1963, where she asked to 
be superannuated.  She served faithfully in the A.M.E. Church until
failing health slowed her energetic pace.

Mrs. Julia McKenzie departed from this life at 9:55 P.M.,
on Friday, December 15, 1978, in Park Community Hospital.

Mrs. Gladys Moorman, daughter of Rev. Julia McKenzie, is a 
faithful and devoted member of this church.  We are pleased to have
her with us as a living witness to the spirit and dedication--of a
faithful few.

""The church can prosper, when ...
we discard the selfish cloak of "" I "".

CHURCH HISTORY

The New St. James African Methodist Episcopal Church was founded February 11,
1962 at 9118 12th Street by Rev. Julia McKenzie with no members.  In September of the
same year she took the Mission into the Annual Conference with ten members.  Rev.
McKenzie pastored the Mission until the Annual Conference convened in August 1963
where she asked to be superanuated.

Rev. S. Paul Johnson was sent to pastor the Mission in September 1963.  Seven members were added and he served until his death.

Rev. Walker L. Collins was assigned in 1964 and served until 1969.  Under Rev. Collins
dedicated leadership 11 members were added.

Rev. Robert L. Nichols became our pastor in September 1969.  The Church was moved to Woodrow Wilson until the acquisition of the present structure at 9321 Rosa Parks 
Boulevard.  The building was purchased by Rev. Nichols and 15 members from Hope United
Presbyterian Church.  Pastor Nichols became ill and requested retirement in
September 1972.

Rev. Robert W. Hoover, Jr. was assigned in October 1972 and served as our leader for
two years.  The Church was dedicated by Bishop Primm in 1974.

In September 1974 Rev. Edward Rountree was selected to pastor and served until the
Conference convened in 1977 when he requested retirement due to ill health. The Church
interior was decorated and aisle areas were carpeted during the tenure of Pastor Rountree.

Rev. Walker L. Collins was reassigned to pastor New St. James and is presently serving
as our leader.  We are experiencing a rejuvenation of Spirit and a renewed dedication ""that
no task is unsurmountable to our few in number""

OUR PRAYER...May God, bestow His Richest Blessings and everlasting Love on
everyone of you.

WE HAVE COME THIS FAR BY FAITH

Dear Ms. Tappes:

Sara Arthur, our Vice-President for Student Affairs, spoke on
the phone on January 9 with Rosa Parks and extended an invitation to 
her to accept an honorary degree from Marymount Manhattan College at
our thirty-second Commencement in June, 1981. She suggested that we
be in touch with you about further details. I am thus writing you
to reiterate our most sincere invitation to Ms. Parks that we may be
allowed the privilege of honoring a woman who has done so much for
the cause of freedom and justice in our nation.

Marymount Manhattan College is a small, independent, four-year
liberal arts college dedicated to the education of the lower and middle
income women of the metropolitan area. Approximately 40% of our
student population comes from minority groups. It would confer exceptional
meaning on the celebration of our Commencement if the College
community and our graduating seniors might recognize Ms. Parks and her
courageous and important work in civil rights.

Commencement takes place on Wednesday, June 3, at 7 p.m. at
Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall. I am enclosing some information
on Marymount Manhattan which I hope you find of interest. It is
my greatest hope that we may receive a favorable reply to our sincere
request. With our best wishes for your happiness and prosperity in
the new year.

Last eve I passed a blacksmith's door,
And heard the anvil sing the vesper chime,
Then looking in I saw lying prostate on the floor.
Old hammers worn by blasting years of time.

How many anvils have you had said I,
To wear and batter those hammers so?
Just one, said he with a twinkle in his eyes,
The anvil wears the hammer out you know.

And so I thought, the anvil of God's word,
For many years skeptic blows have beat upon,
And through the noise of falling blows are heard, 
The anvil is unharmed, the hammers are gone.

Annual N.A.A.C.P. Freedom Fund Dinner, October 28th. I 
regret that longstanding commitments will prevent the 
Governor from attending.

As you can appreciate, the Governor receives many more
invitations that he is able to accept. He enjoys the 
personal contact with Ohioans, however, and will
continue to accommodate as many events as his schedule
will allow.

Again, on behalf of the Governor, thank you for your
thoughtful invitation.

Sincerely,
[signature]
Martin T. Moe

It has been a long journey! Our hearts 
are deeply grateful for what you had the
courage to do. Those of us who were born in 
the South are your kinsister and kinbrother.
We know! But, what is so believeable 
is, our people have suffered indignities 
all over these United States_ The difference, 
some, like you have the courage to fight 
back! You know who you are!
I will always love you because, In 1948,
I had to give up my seat on a Greyhound 
bus traveling to North Carolina. I did cry!
But, thanks to you, I’ll never cry again!
I have been to many schools telling your 
story. May you continue to be strengthen 
by your memorable, courageous deeds 
for all mankind.  Your KinPeople, 
Rev Rufus & Lydia Thompson"

TO: 

The Wooster/Orrville NAACP wishes to thank you for the opportunity
to speak with you. 

Our branch is sponsoring its annual Freedom Fund Dinner 
on Saturday, October 28, 1989 at 6:30 p.m.  This dinner 
will be held at Wayne General Technical College, 10470 Smucker
Rd. Orrville.  The cost is $25 per person. 

Our keynote speaker will be Mrs. Rosa Parks, a veteran in
the cause of freedom.  She joined the fight when she refused 
to give up her seat on the bus December 1, 1955 in Montgomery,
Alabama. 

This is a historical moment for our branch and Wayne-County.
A program of this magnitude requires generous financial 
assistance from organizations such as yours.  Your donation
will go toward ticket purchases for students and senior
citizens.  This is your chance to help many share in this
historical moment.  Will you help by purchasing a block
of tickets?

Since seating is limited, can we receive your contribution by
October 20, 1989? 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

THE LIFEWAYS OF AFRICA
Dr. T. Modibo Ocran, a native of Ghana, will
deliver the opening address to the 1989–90 Contemporary
Issues Forum when it convenes Thursday
evening, September 14, at The University
of Akron’s Wayne College. Ocran, Professor of
Law at The University of Akron’s School of Law,
will speak on “Economic Development in Post-Independence
Africa.“ His address, scheduled
to begin at 7:30 p.m., is open to the public and
free of charge.
Since 1981 Wayne College has annually
presented a series of lectures, panel discussions,
films, and other events with a thematic focus on
a topical issue. This year’s theme is “Africa:
Lifeways of Mystery.”
In October, Dr. Owen Lovejoy, University
Professor of Anthropology at Kent State University,
will discuss the prehistory of East Africa
as the cradle of civilization. Lovejoy is a world-renowned
researcher in the areas of human evolution
and locomotion.
Dr. Bruce Barnes will take those attending the
Forum’s November 16 meeting on a journey to
Timbuktu sharing his insights on Arab Africa.
Barnes, author of several books on North
Africa. He was a Fulbright scholar to Egypt in
1968 and, again, in 1981.
To close out the year, the College will screen
Karen Blixen and Izard Dinesen’s. “Out of
Africa,” starring Meryl Streep, Kraus Maria
Bandauer, and Robert Redford. The film will be
shown on Thursday, December 14, beginning at
7:30 p.m. in the College’s Activities Room.
Forum activities will continue in the new year
with a biologist’s view of wildlife and fossil hunting
in East Africa, African food and dance,
discussion of apartheid in South Africa, and the
beauty and difficulty of one anthropologist’s
overland journey from Tunisia to Kenya.
Previous Forums have examined themes as
varied as the prophecies of George Orwell, mass
media and popular culture, modern medical
dilemmas, and the America’s ethnic diversity.

THINGS TO SEE IN THE LIBRARY
by Barbara Geisey
Come to the library to see a poster exhibit on
Ohio’s environment entitled “Upstream/Downstream
in Ohio.” This exhibit sponsored
by the Ohio Humanities Council combines text
and illustrations to clarify key value questions
about the environment.
The exhibit ties in with a series of book talks
being led by Forrest Smith at the Orville Public
Library.
In the display case Nigel Brush has arranged
many of the relics found in the archaeological dig
conducted this summer near the Barnet-Hoover
Farmhouse. These items range in age and value
all the way from arrowheads to a plastic knife.

WEIGHTROOM and
RAQUETBALL COURTS
Open to all Students
With classes in session many students will be
searching for recreational activities. This year
marks the opening of the Wayne College weight
room. Students, faculty, and staff may use the
new facility free of charge. To use the weight
room, students must display a Wayne College
identification card. An instructor will then explain
to them how each piece of equipment works
and guide them through a trial workout. Instructors
will also explain usage policy. By using the
Pyramid Equipment a student may choose a particular
muscle group to isolate and concentrate
on. For those interested in toning up or increasing
strength, the equipment offers a wide selection
of exercises. Students desiring a cardiovascular
workout may opt for the Schwinn Aire
Dyne exercise bikes.
For the protection of students, the room will
always be supervised, either by Wayne College
or by the Orrville YMCA. The hours are as
follows: Wednesday, 7:00 a.m.–1:00 p.m.;
Thursday, 10:00 a.m.–9:00 p.m.; Friday, 7:00
a.m.–1:00 p.m., and Saturday, 9:00 a.m.–7:00

Prominent Civil
Rights Figure
To Visit Wayne
County Area

by Paul Weaver
More than 30 years ago,
Rosa Parks took a bus ride
that was to have a dramatic
effect on the nation's civil
rights movement. Later this
month, she will be in
Wayne County to speak in
person to those attending
the Annual Freedom Fund
Dinner, sponsored by the
Wooster/Orrville Branch of
the National Association
for the Advancement of
Colored People.

Rosa Parks

The freedom fund dinner
will be held on Saturday,
Oct. 28, at 6:30 p.m. at
Wayne General & Technical
College, in the John E.
Boyer Gymnasium, 10470
Smucker Rd., Orrville.

Parks is well remembered
for her refusal to give up
her seat on a Montgomery,
Alabama bus to a white
male passenger, and her
subsequent arrest. She has
since then been dubbed as
the ""Mother of the Modern
Day Civil Rights Movement""
in the United States.

Over the years, Parks has
done much work with the
NAACP, focusing much of
her attention on the needs
of young people. In 1987,
she established the Rosa
and Raymond Parks Institute

for Self Development.
She has spoken nationally
at schools, colleges and organizations.
Parks has been
the recipient of 10 honorary
doctorate degrees, as well as
numerous certificates,
plaques and awards.

The local NAACP
branch, of which Ronald
Hill is president, has been
holding an annual dinner
since the 1960s. Chairing
this year's event is Lydia
Thompson, publicity director
of the branch and a
member of the Wooster
City School Board.

The theme for the dinner,
notes Thompson, will be
Remembering the Past and
Reaching for the Future.
""The freedom fund dinner is
for everyone,"" she stresses.
In the past, a wide assortment
of people have attended
the dinners, with an
average attendance of about
200.

This year, with the
prominence of Parks as the
keynote speaker, she hopes
to have 1,000 individuals
present.  ""She is nationally
known, and is known as the
mother of the modern day
civil rights movement,""
says Thompson.  ""She did
not give up her seat on the
bus so that we could all
stand up for freedom and
opportunities for all.""

Parks will arrive on Friday,
Oct. 27, in time for a
4 p.m. press conference at
the Wayne Center for the
Arts, located on Walnut
Street in Wooster. At 7:30
p.m., a reception will be
held at the Wooster Community
Center on Bever
Street.

Tickets for the dinner can
be purchased through Oct.
21 at $25 per person. For
more information, call Hill
at 264-6679, Thompson at
262-6436 after 4:30 p.m.,
or the Wayne General &
Technical College bookstore

Guests at the meeting of the Wayne County Peace Coalition on
Saturday included Joseph Kufchak and Allison Schmidt.  Kufchak
talked on behalf of Action for Peace in Central America and The
College of Wooster Students for Peace With Action. He announced a
special showing of the video ""El Salvador in Crisis"" which will be
shown tonight at 7:30 p.m. in the Lean Lecture Room on the college 
campus. Kufchak also circulated a letter to The Daily Record urging
further negotiations to end the bloodshed in El Salvador.  
Schmidt, member of the education department at the college, 
made a presentation in support of the 6.8 mill tax levy, Issue 20 on
the November ballot.  The levy will go toward improving instruction
in the elementary schools of Wooster. 
The coalition voted a contribution for the Wooster-Orrville
NAACP in support of the visit to the area by Rosa Parks, who began
the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s when she refused to take a

seat in the back of a bus. Her visit will include a reception, dinner
and lecture during the weekend of Oct. 27-28. 
Helen Osgood reported on a recent visit to Washington, D.C. to
attend festivities in celebration of the final year of construction of the
Washington Cathedral. 
Osgood read from a brochure about the cathedral which pointed 
out that ""no federal, state, municipal or church funds have gone into
its construction or operation.""  The cathedral has ""been built and
supported entirely by gifts"" from people throughout the world ""who 
have shared the vision of a national cathedral serving the memers of
all faith traditions.""
An invitation from SANE-FREEZE Education Foundation to
attend a two-day media workshop at Case Western Reserve
University on Oct. 28 and 29 was discussed.  The workshop was
initiated by Cuyahoga County Concerned Citizens.

Wayne County Peace Coalition 
Wayne County Peace Coalition welcomed Ron Hill, president of
the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, to its regular meeting on Saturday. Hill announced
that a ""Silent March"" sponsored by the national organization of the 
NAACP will take place in Washington, D.C. on Saturday, Aug. 26.
The purpose of the march is to call attention to the recent Supreme 
Court rulings against the gains in civil rights which were achieved in
the U.S. during the 1950's and '60's. 
Mr. Hill also described plans for a ""Black Dollar Days"" which
will be held in Wooster between Sept. 1-4.  This event will call 
attention to the economic significance of blacks in this community.
According to the 1980 census, 591 blacks were living in Wooster. The
new census will show an increase in the local black population.
Of particular interest to those attending the coalition meeting
was Mr. Hill's announcement of the coming visit of the ""Mother of
the Modern Day Civil Rights Movement,"" Mrs. Rosa Louise Parks. 
She will be speaking in the John Boyer Gymnasium at Wayne
General Technical College on Oct. 28. 
Members of the coalition who participated in the Hiroshima-
Nagasaki Commemoration on the Public Square in Wooster during
the regular noon vigil on Friday, Aug. 4, reported on the character 
and response to the vigil.  There was also discussion of plans to
participate in the United Way Parade. 
Next meeting will be Aug. 26 at the Wayne County Public
Library.

Mother of Civil Rights Movement
Will Speak At Local NAACP Event 

By E.E. JOHNSON
Staff Writer 
A generation ago, an act of courage by Rosa
Parks provided the spark to ignite America's
modern civil rights movement - she refused to
give up her seat on a Montgomery, Ala., bus to a
white male passenger. 
This year, the Wooster Branch of the NAACP 
hopes that Parks' presence in Wayne County will
help spark renewed interest in the local work of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People. 
The 76-year-old woman acclaimed as the mother
of the civil rights movement will be the featured
speaker at the NAACP's annual Freedom Fund
dinner, scheduled for Oct. 28 at Wayne College in
Orrville.
Freedom Fun dinner chairman Lydia Thompson 

said that Parks has already accepted the
Wooster branch's invitation to be the keynote
speaker for its Saturday evening event.  She said
that plans also are being made for a reception
honoring Parks on Friday evening and a press
conference prior to the dinner. 
Individual tickets for the event will be $25 each,
Thompson said, and letters will be sent to area
businesses and industries asking them to support
the NAACP'S local efforts by purchasing dinner
tickets for distribution to area students. 
She said that between 800 and 1,000 dinner guests 
are expected from as far away as Cleveland and
Columbus. Final plans will be announced as soon as
the details are worked out, Thompson said. 
Rosa Parks became famous virtually overnight

PARKS 
(Continued From Page A1)
after refusing to surrender her bus
seat on Dec. 1, 1955. That simple
act triggered a wave of protest that
swept across the United States four
days later. 
Her husband, the late Raymond
Parks, was an early activist in the
effort to free the Scottsboro Boys in
the 1930s. 
Husband and wife worked together
in their local NAACP branch's
program and Rosa Parks was preparing
for a major youth conference
at the time of her arrest in
1955.
After her arrest, black people of
Montgomery and sympathizers of
other races organized and promoted
a boycott of the city bus line
that lasted more than a year. 
The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
was appointed spokesman for the
boycott and his teachings of non-violence 
led eventually to his being
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. 
She retired last year after 23 
years in the employ of U.S. Rep. 
John Conyers, D-Mich. In February
1987 she founded the Rosa and
Raymond Parks Institute for Self
Development, to motivate and direct
""average""  youth not targeted 
by other programs to reach their
highest potential. 
Parks has been awarded the
Spingarn Medal, the NAACP's 
highest award, and the Martin Luther
King Jr. Non-Violent Peace
Prize. She has received 10 honorary
doctorates and hundreds of other
plaques, certificates, citations and
awards.

NAACP Scholarship Fund To Benefit From Banquet 

Mother Of Civil
Rights Movement
Will Be Speaker

ROSA PARKS 

By E.E. JOHNSON
Staff Writer 
Rosa Parks will be the star of the
show this weekend, but the big
winner is expected to be the local
NAACP scholarship fund. 
Parks is widely hailed as the
mother of the modern U.S. civil
rights movement for refusing to
give up her seat to a white man on
a Montgomery, Ala., bus 34 years 
ago, an act that triggered a wave
of protest against racial discrimination
and segregation across the
United States. 
This Saturday, she will be the
keynote speaker for the annual 
Freedom Fund Dinner of the Wooster
branch of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored
People.
Proceeds from the 6:30 p.m. 

event at Wayne College, 10470 
Smucker Road, Orrville, will go 
toward the local NAACP chapter's
scholarship fund for deserving
Wayne County youths. 
With some 600 dinner tickets
already sold at $25 each, organizers 
are expecting the biggest crowd in
the chapter's 23-year history. 
On Friday, Parks will talk to
reporters from northeast Ohio 
newspapers, radio and television
stations in a 4 p.m. press conference
at Wayne Center for the Arts,

with a public reception to follow at
the Wooster Community Center, 241 
S. Bever St., from 7:30–9 p.m. 

At the public reception, Parks 
will autograph photos, civil rights
memorabilia will be on display, the
League of Women Voters will register
voters, the local NAACP chapter 
will sign up new members and
refreshments will be served. 

THE BANQUET PROGRAM will 
include musical performances by
the Wooster High School String
Ensemble and Orrville native Barbara
Waller. 

Remarks will be delivered by
Wooster Mayor J. Clyde Breneman,
Orrville Mayor Howard Wade and
Wayne College Dean Tyrone Turning.
The Rev. Rufus Thompson of 

Wadsworth's First Baptist Church
will offer the invocation and closing
prayer.  

The 76-year-old Parks and her
late husband, Raymond, had been 
active in their local NAACP 
branch.  At the time of her bus
protest on Dec. 1, 1955, Parks was 
preparing for a major youth conference. 

In the wake of her arrest for
refusing to give up her bus seat,
black residents of Montgomery and
other sympathizers organized a bus
boycott that lasted more than a 
year and catapulted the Rev. Martin 
Luther King Jr. into the national
spotlight. 
Parks retired in 1988 after 23 
years working for U.S. Rep. John
Conyers, D-Mich., during which 

time she founded the Rosa and
Raymond Parks Institute for Self
Development, to help ""average"" 
youths, not targeted by other programs,
to reach their highest potential. 

She has been awarded the Spingarn
Medal, the NAACP's highest 
honor, and the Martin Luther King 
Jr. Non-Violent Peace Prize, as
well as 10 honorary doctorates and
hundreds of other plaques, certificates,
citations and awards. 

Tickets for the banquet will be
available through Friday at Maurer
Pharmacy, Crum Drug Store, 
The College of Wooster Black Student
Affairs Office, Black Tie Affair, 
Reynolds Drug Store, Banner
Chevrolet and Wayne College bookstore."

ROSA
PARKS story

CBS celebrates Black History Month with THE ROSA PARKS
STORY, a new television movie based on the life of Rosa
Parks, the ""mother"" of the modern civil rights movement.

Angela Bassett plays Rosa Parks in the drama, which explores
the experiences in Mrs. Parks' childhood and early adult life
that helped shape her philosophy of ""quiet strength,"" which
resulted in her historic moment of peaceful defiance on a 
segregated bus in 1955.  This marks the first time Mrs. Parks
has participated in a screen adaptation of her life story.

Cicely Tyson plays Mrs. Parks' supportive mother, Leona;
Peter Francis James portrays Mrs. Parks' loving husband,
Raymond; and Dexter Scott King makes a cameo appearance
as his father, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

The drama was filmed in Montgomery, Alabama, the site of
Rosa Parks' courageous action on a city bus.

bitterness over the
razing of a community 

Parks will arrive in Nova Scotia 
on July 30 to oversee Pathways to
Freedom, an annual event sponsored 
by the North Carolina-based 
Rosa and Raymond Parks 
Institute for Self Development,
which she founded in 1987 in
memory of her late husband, a fellow
civil rights activist. (The institute
works with youths, ages 11 to
17, to teach them about their heritage 
and help them reach their 
potential.) Pathways to Freedom 
involves young people in commemorating 
the Underground
Railroad, the informal network of
safe houses that helped pre-Civil 
War runaway slaves escape to the 
northern United States and Canada. 
This year's Pathways will see 
20 Nova Scotia youths playing
host to 80 Americans from across 
the United States, including visits
to some of the province's earliest
black settlements. 
While in Halifax, Parks will also 
receive an honorary degree from
Mount Saint Vincent University in
recognition of her unique role in
the civil rights movement. On the
evening of Dec. 1, 1955, Parks was 
riding home from her job as a 
seamstress in downtown Montgomery,
sitting in the first row of 
seats reserved for ""colored"" passengers. 
When the bus filled up
with white people, the driver
ordered Parks and three other
blacks to move to the back. She
refused, and her arrest led to a 
citywide bus boycott that lasted for
381 days, until the United States 
Supreme Court ruled that segregated 
buses were unconstitutional. 
The boycott saw the emergence
of a young preacher, Martin 
Luther King Jr., as a national leader, and ushered in an era of protest
marches and sit-ins that helped break down many of the racial barriers 
black people had faced for generations. 
Among Nova Scotia blacks, Parks's solitary act of defiance has
particular resonance. In a much less publicized incident, Viola 
Desmond, a beautician from Halifax, was arrested in 1946 for
refusing to sit in the balcony reserved for blacks at the Roseland
Theatre in New Glasgow, N.S. While Desmond spent only one 
night in jail for the offence, her story shows that the days when 
black Nova Scotians attended segregated churches and schools
and were barred from white barber shops are not so distant. In
fact, Nova Scotia only outlawed separate schools for blacks in
1954, something that strikes Henry Bishop, chief curator of the
Black Cultural Centre of Nova Scotia in Dartmouth, as particularly
shameful. ""The schools created an atmosphere of inferiority for
those who were exposed to them,"" he says. ""That's the biggest
problem we are still adjusting to today. Hundreds of years of degradation
does not change overnight."" 
The black presence in Nova Scotia began in earnest between 
1775 and 1783, when more than 3,000 free blacks and former
slaves who fought on the side of the British during the American
Revolution earned right of passage to the northern colony. For
these so-called Black Loyalists, promises of free land grants soon 

proved hollow and many had to enter into sharecropping relationships 
with white farmers. A second wave of emigres, known as the
Black Refugees, fared little better. Former slaves who had supported 
the British during the War of 1812, they once again saw
guarantees of adequate food, clothing and shelter give way to the
reality of disease and destitution. 
Despite the hardships, Nova Scotia blacks persevered, helping 
to establish communities across the province. The majority, 
though, gravitated towards Halifax--most notably to the town of
Preston, just east of the city limits, and to Africville. The latter, first
settled 150 years ago, initially held out the promise of hardworking
families maintaining their own country village in the heart of
the provincial capital. But in quick succession, city officials located 
a series of noxious facilities--including a slaughterhouse, an infectious
diseases hospital and garbage dumps--on Africville's
doorstep. By the early 1960s, the community had earned a national
reputation as an American-style ghetto, with no water or sewer 
services and substandard housing. 
Determined to eradicate what it considered an eyesore, the city
of Halifax set out to raze Africville and shift its residents into public
housing. The relocation effort, completed by 1967, was rife with
new indignities. Because of Africville's reputed filth, many moving
companies refused to take the residents' belongings; instead, they
were hauled away in garbage trucks. In a similar vein, bulldozers 
tore down Africville's spiritual centre, the Seaview African Baptist
Church, in the dead of night as most residents lay sleeping. The
legacy of such actions is a lingering bitterness, not to mention an
outstanding lawsuit against the city by some former Africville residents 
demanding compensation for lands they feel were bought
by the city for a fraction of market value.  ""Africville is like a bad
cold, it just won't go away,"" says Bishop. ""Until that wrong has
been righted, there won't be any rest."" 
More recently, the focus of racial tension has been in the
province's schools. In 1989, Cole Harbour High--which serves
predominantly black Preston as well as Eastern Passage, a mainly 
white, working-class suburb of Halifax--garnered national attention
when a snowball fight escalated into a brawl pitting white students 
against black. Five years later, a provincial task force on
black education came to the stark conclusion that ""most African-Canadian
children are from birth trapped in a vicious cycle of societal
rejection and isolation, poverty, low expectations, and low
educational achievement."" The province moved to adopt many of
the commission's recommendations, including the hiring of more
black teachers and principals. But it has yet to heal the divisions at
Cole Harbour High, which was closed for a week last October
after the latest outburst of violence involving white and black students 
and parents. 
For all the setbacks, most black leaders agree there have been
important strides toward equality, reflected in a growing number
of black educators, police officers and civil servants. In the political
arena, however, progress has been painfully slow. In 1993, Wayne
Adams became the first black person elected to the provincial legislature
when he won the Preston riding for the Liberals. In this 
spring's provincial election, Adams was defeated by the NDP's 
Yvonne Atwell, who now holds the distinction of being the first 
female black MLA. Shortly after her election, Atwell drew a vitriolic
public response when she advocated setting aside a dedicated seat
for blacks in the legislature. Newspaper columnists railed against 
what they called reverse racism, while one hotline caller demanded 
to know what Atwell wanted next, ""Blacks-only water fountains?"" he
blustered. ""Their own section on the bus?"" 
Atwell was dismayed by the reaction. ""I thought people had
grown up enough to think about what I was saying,"" she sighs. But
like many black leaders, Atwell prefers not to dwell on the negative 
--and is looking forward to Parks's visit as a possible balm for
the province's racial wounds. Parks, she notes, has shown how
""one person's little act can change the face of history."" Atwell is

Many of us know the story about Rosa Parks who is the woman that refused 
to give up her  bus seat  to a white man in 1955.  This followed her being
arrested, then soon after black people heard the story, they ended up 
boycotting the bus system and found other transportation. This all happened 
because one woman believed that racism should be stopped.  One woman 
believed that segregation  was wrong.  One woman believed  that everyone 
should be treated equally. Soon enough people believed what she believed,
and they still do. 
That year over 300 blacks  boycotted the bus system. In the following year, 
1956, Rosa Parks was charged for boycotting the bus system. On November
13th 1956 segregation on busses was declared unconstitutional by the United 
States Supreme Court.  On December  21st 1956 boycotters returned to the
buses but were still angry about the Rosa Parks incident. 
Rosa Louise McCauley was born on February 4th 1913, McCauley being 
her maiden name before marrying Ray Parks a barber. In the year of 1932.
Parks was born in Tuskegee Alabama. Her husband was an activist with civil 
rights causes. 
Now-a-days more and more people have come to realize that God  created 
every man, woman and child equally and that nobody should be made fun of 
because  of the colour of their skin, the way they look, or even if  they are 
female or male. 
People think "" Oh that was a long time ago, that doesn't  happen any
more,"" but they are wrong. Every day a kid gets pushed out of line or shoved 
into  the lockers and not just because  of the colour of the child's skin but
also because of what they wear or even if the  family  that the child comes
from doesn't  have as much money as the other  kids in the  class/school.
And believe me I am still in school, and It's happened to me and, I have see 
it happen to other kids. 
My way of putting it is that there is nothing wrong with being different.  No
one should be  discriminated against because  of where they are from,  what
they look like,  or  who they are.  Everybody is their own self and, [and]
everyone was created equally. 

Dedicated to Ms. Rosa Parks

Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us,
Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us;
Facing the rising sun of our new day begun,
Let us march on till victory is won.
Stony the road we trod, bitter the chast'ning rod,
Felt in the days when hope unborn had died;
Yet with a steady beat, have not our weary feet,
Come to the place for which our fathers sighed?
We have come over a way that with tears has been watered,
We have come, treading our path thro' the blood of the slaughtered;
Out from the gloomy past, till now we stand at last,
Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast.
God of our weary years, God of our silent tears,
Thou who has brought us thus far on the way;
Thou who hast by Thy might, led us into the light,
Keep us forever in the path, we pray.
Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met Thee,
Lest our hearts drunk with the wine of the world, we forget Thee;
Shadowed beneath Thy hand, May we forever stand,
True to our God, true to our native land.

The university Coat of Arms was granted by the Royal
Heraldric College in London in 1966.
It is based on the coat of arms of the family of 
Elizabeth Seton, foundress of the Congregation of the
Sisters of Charity. The three crescents are from the 
coat of arms of the Seton family. In the Seton arms,
these crescents are tinctured red on a gold field. Blue
and gold are the colors of the French arms and
betoken affinity with Saint Vincent de Paul.
The tressure, which encloses the three crescents, is
also found on the coat of arms granted to Nova Scotia
in 1625.
The book represents knowledge; the maple leaves on
either side, Canada. The dove, a symbol of the Holy
Spirit, emphasizes that knowledge is a means to
wisdom, the highest gift of God, Veritas ad Deum
ducit, the university motto, translates as ""truth leads to 
God"".
The banner of the Coat of Arms, hung over the the 
podium during Convocation ceremonies, was 
presented to Sheila A. Brown on the occasion of her
installation as president in October 1996. The banner
was handmade by Prof. Robert Doyle, a founding
member of the costume studies department at
Dalhousie University.
The banner, and the original document declaring the 
coat of arms, normally hang in the front entrance of  
the E. Margaret Fulton Communications Centre.
The university crest, used for all but the most formal
occasions, is based on the coat of arms.
6
THE MACE
The mace is the symbol of authority for a 
university chancellor, and Mount Saint
Vincent University's mace is unique. It is 
believed that the Mount is the only
university whose mace was made by a
member of the institution's own faculty.
Lovingly carved from Canadian oak, which
traditionally has stood for strength and long
life, the mace took more than 100 hours to
complete. It was carved by Professor John
Barry Wheaton, now Professor Emeritus of
Religious Studies, and was presented to the 
Chancellor in 1978.
The design of the Mount's mace was drawn
mainly from those elements comprising the
univeristy's coat of arms and the university
motto Veritas ad Deum ducit, Truth leads to
God. Truth is illustrated by the combined
alpha and omega symbols on the base and
by the three books representing the arts, the
sciences and the professions as channels by
which we learn and live the truth. The spiral
expresses the idea of striving and ""leading 
to"". The dove crowning the mace, from the 
coat of arms, also represents the Holy Spirit.
The human figures represent members of the 
university community: our founders the 
Sisters of Charity, the Board of Governors,
the president, the administration, the faculty,
the staff, the students, and the surrounding
community. The mound, around which the
figures hold hands, represents the physical
Mount.
Except on academic occasions, the mace is
normally displayed in the university chapel,
along with a more complete description of
its symbolism.

Mount Saint Vincent 
University: 125 Years 
The history of Mount Saint Vincent, tracing its development from academy 
to college to university, is a story of growth and innovation.
The Mount started as an academy established by the Sisters of Charity in
1873. In 1914, an agreement was signed with Dalhousie University,
enabling students to enrol in the first two years of a bachelor's degree
program at the Mount and to continue for the last two years and the
awarding of the degree at Dalhousie.
In 1925, the Nova Scotia legislature awarded the Mount the right to grant its
own degrees, making it the only independent women's college in the British 
Commonwealth.
During the night of January 31, 1951, the entire plant of Mount Saint
Vincent was destroyed by fire. Temporary quarters for students and Sisters
were found elsewhere in the city and classes were conducted in borrowed
spaces. Fortunately, with construction already begun, Evaristus Hall was
ready in time for classes to resume normally the following fall.
A new charter was granted in 1966, changing the name from Mount Saint 
Vincent College to Mount Saint Vincent University. Under its terms, a lay
Board of Governors and Senate were established along with the Corporation
representing the Sisters of Charity.
In July 1988, the current charter was approved by the Nova Scotia
legislature, transferring ownership of the university from the Sisters of 
Charity to the Board of Governors.
Men were first admitted as students in 1967. Today, women represent 85
per cent of the 3,700 students. Almost half of all students attend part-time.
This special ceremony of Convocation is the first in a series of events to 
celebrate Mount Saint Vincent's distinctive role in the community over the
past 125 years and into the new millenium.

Rosa Louise Parks

Mrs. Rosa Louise Parks is widely
recognized as the ""mother of the
modern day civil rights movement""
in the United States. On December
1, 1955, she refused to surrender her
seat to a white male passenger on an 
Alabama bus and was subsequently
arrested. This quiet, courageous act
sparked a nation-wide civil rights
protest and would forever change the 
course of American history.

Mrs. Parks was born Rosa Louise
McCauley on February 4, 1913 in
Tuskegee, Alabama. Her formal 
education was interrupted when she was obliged to leave high school to help
care for her ailing grandmother and then her mother. In 1932 she married
Raymond Parks, an early civil rights activist, and with his support and
encouragement she returned to school and received her high school
diploma.

Together, Rosa and Raymond Parks worked the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) programs. She served as
secretary and later youth leader of the local branch. At the time of her 1955
arrest, she was preparing for a major youth conference.

In 1987, she co-founded the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self-Development,
which is aimed at motivating and directing youth. Today she
continues to speak to young people at schools, colleges and national
organizations around the world.

She has been honored for her civil rights work with numerous awards,
including more than 20 honorary degrees and the Medal of Freedom, the
highest award given to a US citizen. Rosa Parks is also the author of four
books, Rosa Parks: My Story, Quiet Strength, Dear Mrs. Parks: A Dialogue
with Today's Youth, and I Am Rosa Parks.

I won't get in your way,
I just want a seat, can't wait
'Til tomorrow, I'm tired today.

I'm not gonna raise no ruckus,
Won't be no fuss to be found,
I'll even go to sleep, if you let me,
I just wanta' sit down.

I've been watchin' y'all a long time
On this here city bus,
As you tip your hat to the white ladies,
And act just like I'm black dust.

To you, I'm just a nobody,
A mere slave that's been bound,
But today I'm gonna be Somebody,
For today, I will sit down.

So, I'm not movin', Mr. Bus Driver
As you look at me with a frown
This day, this city will have to deal with me
For this day, I'm gonna sit down.

I'm not gonna wait for that great morning,
When Gabriel makes the trumpet sound,
I want a seat right here, right now,
And today, I will sit down.

For in that Great Day, my Lord's 
Gonna give me wings to get around,
When I get over in Glory,
I'm not gonna want to sit down.

So I'm not moving', Mr. Bus Drver,
You might as well call the law,
This lady's gonna sit here,
Stubborn as any mule you ever saw.

Women, today, are standing,
Marching, fighting for equal ground,
But a whole movement was started,
Just because a little lady wanted to sit down!

(a composite of many experiences)
by Delores Lake [reenacted by Courtney Parsons]
Don't mind me Mr. Bus Driver
I have paid my fare,
Now pardon me, let me pass
""Cause I'mm gonna sit over there.""

You see, there's no room in the back,
And I'm too tired to stand,
You don't have to help me
Don't even have to give me a hand.

I've worked all day scrubbing, washing
Laundering, sewing, by the pound
My bones is weary, I'm 'bout to drop
And today, I want to sit down.

Now, I don't hate none of y'all,
I treat everybody just the same,
All I want is a seat,
Not money or great fame.

When I was younger, I could do it
Work like a mule, run like a greyhound
But I'm older now, my heart's not as strong
And today, I must sit down.

All these empty seats in front,
They alll just going to waste,
Why should I stand in the back,
Just 'cause I've got this black face.

I've worked all my life
All over this here town
I've rode this bus for twenty years
And this day, I want to sit down."

Lift Every Voice and Sing
Negro National Hymn
by James Weldon Johnson & Rosamond Johnson
Lift ev'ry voice and sing, till earth and
heaven ring,
Ring with the harmonies of liberty.
Let our rejoicing rise, high as the list'ning 
skies,
Let it resound loud as the roaring sea.
Sing a song full of the faith that the dark
past has taught us,
Sing a song full of the hope that the present
has brought us;
Facing the rising sun of our new day begun,
Let us march on till victory is won.

Stony the road we trod, bitter the chast'ning
rod,
Felt in the days when hope unborn had died;
yet with a steady beat, have not our weary
feet,
Come to the place for which our fathers 
sighed?
We have come over a way that with tears
has been watered,
We have come, treading our path thro' the
blood of the slaughtered,
out from the gloomy past, till now we stand
at last
Where the white gleam of our bright star is
cast.
God of our weary years, God of our silent
tears,
Thou who has brought us thus far on the 
way; 
Thou who hast by thy might, led us into the 
light,
Keep our fee stray from the places, our God 
where we met Thee,
Lest our hearts, drunk with the wine of the 
world, we forget Thee;
Shadowed beneath Thy hand, may we
forever stand,
True to our God, true to our native land."

names of fifteen books of the Bible. It
is a lulu. Kept me looking so hard for
facts I missed the revelation. I was in 
a jam especially because the names
were not capitalized. The truth will
come to numbers of our readers. To
others it will be a real job. For all it
will be a most fascinating search.
Yes there will be some easy to spot
others hard to judge, so we
admit it usually results in loud
lamentations when we can't find
them. One lady said she brews coffee 
while she puzzles."

watched.  I have seen the

Underground Railroad, loose network of antislavery northerners-mostly blacks-that illegally helped 
fugitive slaves reach safety in the free states or Canada in the period before the American Civil War; it was 
also called the Liberty Line.  Begun in the 1780s under Quaker auspices, the activity acquired legendary
fame after the 1830s.  It was once thought that more than 60,000 slaves gained their freedom in this way,
but that estimate is probably an exaggeration.

Because of its proximity to the North, the upper South supplied a high proportion of fugitives.  They
were usually young adults, male, unattached, and highly skilled; family flights were rare.  Traveling by night
to avoid detection, escapees used the North Star for guidance.  Usually they sought isolated ""stations""
(farms) or ""vigilance committee"" agents in towns, where sympathetic free blacks could effectively conceal
them.  When possible, ""conductors"" met them at such border points as Cincinnati, Ohio, and Wilmington,
Delaware.  The lake ports of Detroit, Sandusky, Ohio, Erie, Pennsylvania, and Buffalo, New York, were
terminals for quick escape to Canada.  Harriet Tubman, called the Moses of the blacks, and Levi Coffin, a
Cincinnati Quaker, were among the famous rescuers.  Professional slave catchers and vigilant officials
often seized refugees to gain rewards.

More important than the number arriving safely was the publicity given to this clandestine work, which 
helped to make northern whites conscious of the evils of slavery.  The federal Fugitive Slave Law of 1793
became difficult to enforce as Yankee judges and legislators restricted masters' rights of recovery.  A new
law, part of the Compromise of 1850, was more stringent, but the activities of the Underground Railroad
continued.  Outraged at northern defiance of the law, southerners grew increasingly provoked.  Antagonism
over fugitives and the publicity accorded them were crucial in fueling the flames of sectional mistrust that 
eventally led to the American Civil War."

I say to you today, my friends, so even
though we face the difficulties of today and
tomorrow, I still have a dream.
It is a dream deeply rooted in the
American dream.  I have a dream that one
day this nation will rise up and live out the
true meaning of its creed.  We hold these
truths to be self-evident that all men are
created equal.
I have a dream that one day on the red
hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves
and the sons of former slave owners will be
able to sit down together at the table of 
brotherhood...I have a dream that one day
even the state of Mississippi, a state 
sweltering with the heat of injustice, 
sweltering with the heat of oppression, will
be transformed into and oasis of freedom
and justice.
I have a dream that my four little
children will one day live in a nation where
they will not be judged by the color of their
skin but by the content of their character.  I
have a dream today.  I have a dream that 
one day down in Alabama, with its vicious 
racists, with its governor having his lips
dripping with words of interposition and
nullification, one day right there in Alabama
little black boys and black girls will be able
to join hands with little white boys and white
girls as sisters and brothers.  I have a dream
today.
I have a dream that one day every valley
shall be exalted, every hill and mountain
shall be made low, the rough places will be 
made straight and the glory of the Lord
shall be revealed and all shall see it
together.  This is our hope.  This is our faith
that I go back to the South with.  With this
faith, we will be able to hew out of the 
mountain of despair a stone of hope.  With 
this faith we will be able to transform the
jangling discords of our nation into a 
beautiful symphony of brotherhood.  With
this faith we will be able to work together, to
pray together, to struggle together, to go to
jail together, to stand up for freedom
together, knowing that we will be free one
day...
And if America is to be a great nation,
this must become true.  So let freedom ring.
From the prodigious hilltops of New
Hampshire, let freedom ring.  From the
mighty mountains of New York, let freedom
ring.
From the heightening Alleghenies of
Pennsylvania, let freedom ring.  From the
snow-capped Rocks of Colorado, let
freedom ring.  From the curvaceous slopes
of California.
But not only that; let freedom ring from
Stone Mountain of Georgia.  Let freedom
ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee.
Let freedom ring from every hill
and molehill of Mississippi.  From every
mountainside, let freedom ring.
And when this happens, and when we 
allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring
from every village and every hamlet, from 
every state and every city, we will be able to 
speed up that day when all of God's 
children, black men and white men, Jews
and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will
be able to join hands and sing in the words
of the old Negro spiritual:
Free at last, free at last,
Thank God Almighty, we're free at last.
Let Freedom Ring!

This play ""My Soul Looks Back and Wonder How I
Got Over..."" has been written to help us become 
familiar with African-American History and the
people who contributed to it.  Their achievements
have brought beauty, culture, safety, progress and
richness to the world.

Here, this evening, we present famous 
African-Americans who have left their marks on
History.  Each knew the value of freedom, education
and worked hard to attain knowledge.

All overcome heavy odds and endured great
hardships, but with vision and strength from 
above... ""They got over"".

We hope you enjoy this production, and that you
will be inspired to believe that what may seem
impossible can be obtained with vision, faith and
determination.

THE BUSES HAD A WHITES ONLY SECTION OF SEATS.  THE REST OF 
THE BUS WAS SEATING FOR BLACK PEOPLE.  HOWEVER, WHEN MORE 
WHITE PASSENGERS GOT ON THE BUS THAN THE WHITE SECTION
COULD ACCOMMODATE,  IT WAS DICTATED BY LAW THAT BLACK
PASSENGERS WOULD GIVE UP THEIR SEATS.  IF ONLY ONE WHITE 
PERSON WANTED A SEAT, ALL BLACK PASSENGERS IN THAT ROW
WERE REQUIRED TO MOVE TO THE BACK OF THE BUS. 

IN SILENT PROTEST MRS. PARKS WOULD OFTEN USE THE STAIRS IN
A BUILDING RATHER THAN THE ""BLACK ONLY"" ELEVATOR OR WALK 
HOME FROM WORK RATHER THAN ENDURE THE HUMILIATION OF THE 
BUS SYSTEM AND THE CAPRICIOUSNESS OF ITS DRIVERS.

Mr. Parks was very active in the National Association for 
the Advancement of Coloured People, the NAACP. In 1943
Mrs. Parks became Secretary of the Montgomery Alabama
NAACP and in 1949 became adviser to it's Youth Council. She 
also worked with the Montgomery Voters League. This
organization prepared Black people to pass the various
tests that had been concocted to make it difficult for 
them to register as voters. Mrs. Parks attempted to
register to vote on several occasions and was successful
in 1945.
Mrs. Parks personal history with the bus system showed
her determination and quiet strength. The procedure for
a Black person to use the bus was to pay their fare to the
driver at the front door and then proceed to the back
door of the bus to get on. Many times the driver would
shut the door, drive away, and leave the Black person
standing on the sidewalk after they had paid their fare.
Mrs. Parks had been evicted from buses as early as 1943"

enveloped by a family circle that included her mother and 
maternal grandparents, Rosa was inspired by their
attitude and imbued with the feeling that we are all human
beings and should be treated as such. Mrs. McCauley was
a school teacher and taught her daughter until age
eleven. She did not agree with legally enforced racial
segregation and from this environment Rosa developed a
deep Christian faith and a lifelong commitment to justice.
At the age of eleven, Rosa attended the Montgomery
Industrial School for Girls. The School's philosophy
support the concept of self-worth which strengthened
the teachings of her family.
Another major influence in Rosa McCauley's life that
further reinforced and supported her upbringing, was her
marriage in 1932 in Pine Level, Alabama to Raymond Parks.

Madame Vice Chancellor, Distinguished guests, ladies and
gentlemen
It is a supreme honour and privilege to introduce Rosa
Louise Parks.
The story of the events on the bus in Montgomery Alabama
on December 1, 1955 have been retold many times. Although
she was physically tired from working as a seamstress at
the Montgomery Fair Department Store, there was much 
more to this act of courage.
In 1915, Leona McCauley moved from Tuskegee Alabama to
Montgomery with her two small children, her daughter
Rosa aged two years and her younger child Sylvester.
They lived with Mrs. McCauley's parents, Mr. and Mrs.
Edwards. Both Mr. and Mrs. Edwards had been born into
slavery. After the Emancipation Proclamation, life did not
improve substantially for these farmers in rural Alabama."

ROSA LOUISE PARKS
BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH 

Rosa Louise Parks is nationally recognized as the ""Mother of the Modern Day Civil Rights
Movement"" in America.  Her refusal to surrender her seat to a white male passenger on a 
Montgomery, Alabama bus, December 1, 1955, triggered a wave of protest December 5, 1955,
that reverberated throughout the United States.  Her quiet courageous act changed America, its 
view of black people and redirected the course of history. 

Mrs. Parks was born Rosa Louise McCauley, February 4, 1913 in Tuskegee, Alabama.  She was
the first child of James and Leona Edwards McCauley.  Her brother, Sylvester McCauley, now
deceased, was born August 20, 1915.  Later, the family moved to Pine Level, Alabama where
Rosa was reared and educated in the rural school.  When she completed her education in Pine
Level at age eleven, her mother, Leona, enrolled her in Montgomery Industrial School for Girls 
(Miss White's School for Girls), a private institution.  After finishing Miss White's School, she
went on to Alabama State Teacher's College High School.  She, however, was unable to graduate
with her class, because of the illness of her grandmother Rosa Edwards and later her death. 

As Rosa prepared to return to Alabama State Teacher's College, her mother also became ill,
therefore, she continued to take care of their home and care for her mother while her brother, 
Sylvester, worked outside of the home.  Rosa received her high school diploma in 1934, after her
marriage to Raymond Parks, December 18, 1932.  Raymond, now deceased, was born in
Wedowee, Alabama, Randolph County, February 12, 1903, received little formal education due to 
racial segregation.  He was a self educated person with the assistance of his mother, Geri Parks.
His immaculate dress and his thorough knowledge of domestic affairs and current events made 
most think he was college educated.  He supported and encouraged Rosa's desire to complete her 
formal education. 

Mr. Parks was an early activist in the effort to free the ""Scottsboro Boys"", a celebrated case in the
early 1930s.  Together, Raymond and Rosa worked in the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People (NAACP's) programs.  He was an active member and she served 
as secretary and later youth leader of the local branch.  At the time of her arrest, she was
preparing a major youth conference. 

After the arrest of Rosa Parks, black people at Montgomery and sympathizers of other races 
organized and promoted a boycott of the city bus line that lasted 381 days.  Mr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr. was appointed the spokesperson for the Bus Boycott and taught nonviolence to all 
participants.  Contingent with the protest in Montgomery, others took shape throughout the south 
and the country.  They took form as sit-ins, eat-ins, swim-ins, and similar causes.  Thousands of
courageous people joined the ""protest"" to demand equal rights for all people.

ROSA PARKS TO RECEIVE HONORARY DEGREE FROM MSVU

Rosa Louise Parks, the 85-year old ""Mother of the Modern Day Civil Rights Movement""
in America, will receive an honorary degree from Mount Saint Vincent University on
Sunday, August 2.  The special convocation held in her honor will kick off Mount Saint
Vincent's 125th Anniversary Celebrations.

On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks refused to surrender her seat to a white male passenger
on an Alabama bus and was subsequently arrested.  This quiet, courageous act propelled a 
nation-wide civil rights protest and would forever change the course of American history.
The energy of youth as a force for change is a favorite theme of Ms. Parks.  In 1987, she 
co-founded the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self-Development, which is aimed
at motivating and directing youth, and today she continues to speak to young people at
schools, colleges and national organizations around the world.  She has been honored for
her civil rights work with numerous awards, including the Medal of Freedom, the highest
award given a U.S. citizen, and is the author of four books.

""Rosa Parks is a rose model and a symbol of freedom for people of all races and cultures
worldwide.  Mount Saint Vincent University is delighted that Ms. Parks has accepted our
invitation, and we look forward to honoring her for her enormous contribution to
advancing civil rights,"" comments Mount President, Dr. Sheila Brown.

Ms. Parks will be in Halifax in conjunction with Pathways to Freedom, an intensive multi-cultural
training program for youth, being held in the city from July 31 to August 3.  The 
program is co-sponsored by The Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self-Development,
and, locally, by the Nova Scotia Pathways to Freedom Organizing
Committee 1998.

""We are elated to bring Rosa Parks to Halifax,"" says Committee Chair Carolyn Thomas.
""For the Black community in particular, her courage and her work as a civil rights activist
provides inspiration and hope.  Her visit marks an historic occasion for us, and already, the
response from the Black community has been overwhelming.""

OPINION
Enlightened, uplifted by Rosa Parks' example
Joan Jones

BY NOW,  everyone knows 
that Rosa Parks was in 
Nova Scotia.  How fortunate 
we are to have had the 
mother of the modern civil 
rights movement visit our province.

Her actions directly influenced 
those of us who took up 
the struggle for better conditions 
for black people in Canada.  
Whether it was fighting 
for equality in housing, employment, 
or education, her courage 
buoyed all of us.  She became 
the beacon of light, and proof 
that things can change.

There is little to be said 
about this gracious woman's accomplishments 
that is not already 
public knowledge.  However, 
she is someone who can 
never receive too much praise
 
or recognition about her 
achievements.  She is truly the 
outstanding example of a 
woman of African descent.

Some of us were fortunate to 
observe Natal Day in a way 
that will be etched in our 
memories for many years.  It is 
not often that we have the opportunity 
to be in the company 
of someone whose bravery 
forced a city and, ultimately, a 
nation to look at their mistreatment 
of people of African heritage.

Her refusal to conform to racial 
discrimination on the buses 
of Montgomery, in Alabama, 
changed the course of history.  
It gave blacks in North America 
hope.  There is no doubt that 
Rosa Parks' bravery was an example 
of what can be achieved 
with peaceful resistance.  Even 
today, under similar circumstances, 
many of us would not 
have the fortitude to do what 
she did.

For more than 40 years she 
has continued focusing her 
seemingly unlimited energy on 
civil rights and, in particular, 
black youth.  Rosa Parks is already 
an historical figure who 
continues to influence the 
hearts and minds of doubters.  
She continues teaching blacks, 
young and old, whether sitting 
or standing for what is right, 
that the pursuit for a just society 
is not over.  We still have a 
long way to go and lots more 
work to do.

Mrs. Parks graciously accepted 
from the honourary degree 
from Mount Saint Vincent University 
on Aug. 1, the latest in a 
total of well over 20 honourary 
degrees.  The air was thick with 
anticipation and excitement at 
the convocation.  African Nova 
Scotians had shown up en 
masse just to be in the same 
room with greatness.  Speaker 
after speaker acknowledged 
her achievements.

Probably the most astonishing 
realization is that this little 
woman almost single-handedly 
started the modern civil rights 
movement, the very same 
movement that eventually 
spread to Canada, where the injustices 
and wrongs, although 
more subtle, bore little difference.

The convocation was even 
more special because representatives 
from all aspects of the 
black community participated.  
African Nova Scotians, whether 
members of the audience or 
speakers, were hushed and 
humbled just to be near someone 
who was instrumental in affecting 
changes in our history.

There are few Black heroes 
who are well known be men, 
women, and children of all 
races worldwide.  Rosa Parks 
has undoubtedly proven that 
heroes and heroines of African 
descent know no borders.  Too 
often African Canadians are expected 
to find their heroes and 
heroines within the confines of 
our own borders.

However, the response to 
Mrs. Parks proves that black 
Canadians have love, respect, 
and appreciation for African 
Canadians/Americans who 
made the journey easier.

Not enough can be said about 
the greatness and serenity of 
Mrs. Rosa Parks.  Few times 
during our lives are we in the 
presence of such greatness.

If all of us accomplished a 
fraction of what Mrs. Parks has 
over the past 40 years, then we 
truly could say we brought improvements 
to life.

Joan Jones is a metro-area human
rights activist.

Rosa Parks 'truly inspiring:' Mount honors rights pioneer

From yesterday's Halifax Daily News, with a story written by Sue Coueslan.  
An excerpt:

Hymns, applause, and deep respect filled the auditorium where 1,000 people 
gathered to honor Dr. Rosa Parks yesterday afternoon.

Parks was the guest of honor at a special convocation at Mount Saint Vincent 
University...

""We talk about people who stand up for what they believe in.  Rosa Parks 
sat for what she believed in,"" Mount Saint Vincent president Sheila Brown 
said to laughter and applause.  Brown was referring to the famous 1955 incident 
when Parks refused to give up her seat to a white man on an Alabama 
bus.

Parks's action led to a 381-day boycott by the black community in Montgomery, 
Ala., and helped bring the issue of racial segregation to the fore.

Rosa Parks honored

Mount Saint Vincent University 
granted an honorary doctor of 
letters degree to Rosa Parks, a key 
figure on the U.S. civil-rights 
movement.

Parks made headlines in 1955 
when she refused to give her seat 
to a white passenger on a Montgomery, 
Ala., bus.  Her act led to a 
city-wide bus boycott, which 
eventually put an end to racial 
segregation on public transportation.

Since then she has continued 
to contribute to the movement, especially 
in organizing youth programs."

Black communities' anger justified, but misdirected

Rosa Parks and the n-word
Charles Saunders

THE MORE THINGS change, the more
they stay the same.  That's one of the
oldest cliches in the book.  Yet time
and time again, that old saying is
proven to be true - especially when it
comes to racial concerns.
A case in point occurred last week, when
the celebrated civil-rights pioneer Rosa
Parks came to Halifax to receive an -
honorary doctorate from Mount Saint Vincent
University.  Park's refusal to surrender
her seat on a Montgomery, Ala., bus to a
white passenger back in 1955 is credited as
the starting point of a 10-movement
that ended legal segregation in the United
States.
Her visit was a boost for Nova Scotia's
black community.  Almost all the publicity
surrounding the event was positive.  There
was even a two-page feature on Parks and
black Nova Scotians in the Aug. 3 issue of
MacLean's magazine.
But there was one negative incident - a
reminder that the racism against which
Parks and many others have battled has not
been eradicated in the hearts and minds of
all.
When Parks arrived at Halifax International
Airport on Saturday, Aug. 1, she was
met by a crowd of more than 100 well-wishers,
who greeted her with flowers and accolades.
At least one person at the airport, however,
was not impressed.  As reported by Sue
Coueslan in the next day's Sunday DailyNews:
""A tall man in the crowd with an
American accent said with a chuckle: 'All
this just for another old n---er.'""
That was a comment characteristic of
""just another old bigot.""  It doesn't matter
whether the speaker was old or
young; the attitude he so pungently expressed
is as old as the dinosaurs, and
ought to be just as extinct.  This person's
willingness to say something
so offensive within earshot of others 
in the airport reflects a level of
ignorance that is beyond redemption.
Obviously, his attitude was not
shared by most of the other people
who were at the airport, regardless
of whether they had gone
there to see Parks.  Nor is it shared
by most Nova Scotians: nor, for
that matter, most Canadians and
Americans.
Nor is it shared by Coueslan.
Yet she, rather than the garbage-
mouthed racist at the airport, has
borne the brunt of the black community's
anger over the incident
and the way it was reported in The
Daily News.
However, the man's comment was
as offensive to Coueslan as it would be
to anyone else who abhors his sentiments.
""There was an atmosphere of celebration
at the airport."" Coueslan recalls.  ""The
people I was talking to were so proud that


she was coming.  They couldn't believe a
person of such stature was here.""
And Coueslan couldn't believe what she
heard a few moments later.
""The RCMP were clearing the way for
her (Parks), when thisman made the comment.
He was standing there, smiling and
shaking his head when he made this comment.
He just smiled.  He wasn't the  least bit
ashamed of saying it.  I was shocked ...
stunned.""
The man later made
similar remarks to
Daily News photographer
Mike Dembeck.
He

said: 'They're nothing but trouble.  You can
keep 'em all,'"" Dembeck recalls.
The man identified himself as ""an
American.""
Coueslan then had to decide whether or
not to include the comment in the story she
would write about Park's arrival.  It was
not an easy decision.
""I thought that guy doesn't deserve to
have his comments put in the paper."" she 
says.  ""On the other hand, the comment does
reflect the fact that even 40 years after the
incident with Rosa parks on the bus, there's
still all this work that needs to be done; that
some people are still stupid and don't get it.
So I made the decision to let the comment
stay in.""
Daily News editors. who have the final
say in what gets into the paper, allowed the
paragraph to stand.
When I first saw the comment in Coueslan's
story, my reaction was anger - at the
redneck ignoramus who made
it, not the writer who reported
it.  However,
other members
of the black
community
have
expressed

ire against Coueslan and The Daily
News because they feel the comment detracted
from what was otherwise a positive,
even historic, event.
Given the negative reaction to the inclusion
of the comment, Coueslan has had
some second thoughts, but few regrets.
""I can't say I wish I didn't put it in."" she
says.  ""Because I still think that it does need
to be addressed, and I stand behind why I
decided it was the thing to do.  I just wish it
wasn't so misunderstood.""
I can certainly understand the indignation
other blacks have expressed over what
they saw in the paper.  But it wasn't Coueslan
or The Daily News who insulted Rosa
Parks.  It was a travelling racist who didn't
have the sense or manners to keep his stupidity
to himself.  There's no discernable
difference between him and the driver who
ordered Parks to move to the back of the
bus all those years ago. 
And, unfortunately, there are still
enough people like him around to ensure
the war Parks began when she stayed in her
bus seat is not yet over.  Many battles have
been won since 1955, but some holdouts on
the losing side still refuse to surrender.
Rosa Parks is 85 years old.  During her
lifetime, she has witnessed tremendous
changes in the circumstances of blacks
throughout the world.  The legal segregation
under which she grew up has been 
overturned, not just in the southern U.S.
states, but also in northern states, and
Canada, and South Africa.  Opportunities in 
employment and education have opened.
The number of black office-holders has
burgeoned.  The black middle class has
grown and prospered.  To say that nothing
has changed for blacks during the
second half of this century is to deny
reality.
But to say that nothing remains 
the same is just as unrealistic.
Racism continues to plague blacks
and other minorities in ways that
are large and small.  It mutates like
the HIV virus.  Before, racism was
simply the believe that whites are
inherently superior to all other
races.  Now, it has morphed into
the belief that minorities are being
given unfair advantages over
whites through affirmative-action
programs.  That is the racial battleground
of the '90s, and will continue
to be so well into the next 
century, at least until the next mutation
occurs.
Laws can change.  Policies can
change.  Times can change.  But
sometimes, attitudes stay set in
stone - or, in the case ofthe airport
commentator, the Stone Age.  So we
should celebrate Rosa Parks: her
courage, her dignity,and what she
stands for.  And we should not shoot the
messenger who brings us news we'd
rather not hear.

Hindsight
Rosa parks was lionized when 
she was in Halifax this week, 
and rightly so. Back in 1955 in 
Alabama, she refused to give up 
her seat on a bus to a white 
man. From that small mutiny 
grew an unstoppable national 
civil rights protest. What she did 
back then took great courage 
but, quite honestly, I've always 
felt that the legend surrounding that 

small act of defiance somehow 
diluted her bravery. I'd read 
how Rosa had remained seated 
because she was too tired to 
move after a hard day working 
as a seamstress. But with her 
visit to Nova Scotia came new 
stories that suggest Rosa Parks, 
far from being an accidental 
heroine, was in fact an educated 
young woman who knew exactly 
what she was doing that fateful 
day. To my mind that makes 
her much more a role model for 
people of all races to applaud.
I'm trying hard not to be cynical 
about this week's signing of a 
treaty with the Nisga'a in British 
Columbia. The area ceded back 
to the natives almost 1,500 
kilometres northwest of Vancouver. 
I just wonder what would've

Rosa Parks

Rosa Parks visits Halifax
HALIFAX.  A chorus of praise greeted 
Rosa Parks, known as the mother of 
the U.S. civil-rights movement, as 
she arrived at the Halifax International 
Airport on Saturday. 
""Thank you, Miss Rosa. You are 
the spark. You got our people moving. 
Thank you, sister Rosa Parks,"" 
declared 100 young people and their 
chaperons, members of an educational 
program for young black people. 
Ms. Parks, 85, whose refusal to 
give up her seat to a white man on 
an Alabama bus in 1955 changed 
history for black-white relations, got 
an honorary degree yesterday from 
Mount Saint Vincent University.

[*July 3-Aug 6 '98*]

Get on the bus
Rosa Parks rides the bus again, this time all 
the way to Nova Scotia

LAST FRIDAY A GROUP OF 20 STUDENTS, AGED
11-17, selected from communities across the 
province, flew to Detroit to learn more about 
their heritage from the ""Mother of the Modern 
Civil Rights Movement,"" Dr. Rosa Parks.

Dr. Parks became internationally known 
when, in December 1955, she refused to give up 
her seat to a white man on a Montgomery, 
Alabama bus. Her subsequent arrest prompted a 
381-day bus boycott, led by Martin Luther King, 
and was instrumental in bringing the US civil 
rights movement to the world's attention. 

The students are taking part in the 1998 
Pathways to Freedom bus tour, which traces the 
Underground Railroad and 1960s freedom bus 
routes from the US into Canada, organized by the 
Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self-Development. 
The Nova Scotian students--selected 
from more than 50 applicants from the Black Cultural 
Centre, the Black Youth Helpline, the Nova 
Scotia Home for Coloured Children and the 
African United Baptist Association--made the 
trip to Hillsdale, Michigan to join American students 
for orientation before setting off on the bus 
tour. The entire group, accompanied by Dr. 
Parks, arrives in Nova Scotia today to take part in 
four days of multi-cultural training workshops 
designed to ""provide leadership training and 
instill motivation for achieving their highest 
potential,"" says Carolyn Thomas, chair of the 
local organizing committee. 

While in Halifax, Dr. Parks will receive an 
honorary degree from Mount St. Vincent University 
on Sunday, before leading the bus tour back 
through Ontario and Michigan to visit towns 
connected with the underground railroad. 

The visit to Nova Scotia may be a one-off 
event this year, but Pathways to Freedom organizes 
training programs annually in Michigan. 
Thomas says she hopes this stop in the province 
will spur some interest in setting up a scholarship 
that would enable Nova Scotian youth to take 
part in the program every year.      GG"

A hero of her own 

This letter, written by Granville Ferry’s 
Shirley E. Jackson, was read aloud just before 
Rosa Parks was bestowed an honorary 
degree by Mount St. Vincent University on 
Saturday afternoon. After the ceremony, Ms. 
Parks met briefly with Mrs. Jackson.

Dear Ms. Rosa Parks,
I am a 44-year-old Black Canadian mother 
and wife living in rural Nova Scotia. 
Though we are miles apart and have never 
met, it is important to me that I express my 
feelings of appreciation to you. 

Life is so amazing. Having children 
has made me very much aware of the act of 
life and the fact of death. It has also made 
me appreciate the life I can live with so 
much freedom. As a Black woman, I don’t 
feel we have a whole lot of heroes who reflect 
who we are. Yes, we do have great 
singers and actresses —and not wanting to 
denigrate their talents, I feel those talents 
may not let you see who they are, and may 
not be life-changing qualities. Yes, I admire 
their abilities to perform, their desire to 
succeed, their willingness to put in the 
practice and hard work, and also their patience 
in waiting for the rewards; but it 
doesn’t have a direct impact on my life.

You, on the other hand, have.

I first heard of you in my preteen years, 
watching the black-and-white TV screen in 
our family home back in the ‘60s while
 
growing up in Granville Ferry, 
Annapolis County, Nova Scotia, Canada. This 
shows me how our world is so miraculous: 
there our family sat in our overflowing, 
well lived-in home, in Nova Scotia, Canada
...watching life unfold in the Southern 
United States.  We'd be sprawled on the floor, 
draped in the chairs, standing in the 
doorway, sitting at someone's feet...the 
room would be full, and we would all be 
staring at that black-and-white TV.  Some 
silent, some shaking their heads and making 
tsking sounds of disbelief.  Mom with 
tear-filled eyes.  Dad cursing at those 
""damned, white sons of bees.""  We always 
watched the news, so we saw:
our Black American men and women 
being forced back by lunging police dogs 
when they took to the streets to march for 
freedom;
our Black American men and women, 
girls and boys, being forced to the ground 
from the pressure of water shooting at 
them from hoses directed by white hands;
the National Guardsmen standing at attention 
as the Black school children 
walked up the steps, bombarded by shouts, 
slurs, cold stares, and icy silence:  wondering 
if a shot would ring out before they 
reached precarious safety inside the 
school;

those brave 
men and women 
who would not leave the 
restaurant that would not serve 
""coloreds"";
the black-and-white image of the horseback 
rider with the white hood hiding his 
cowardly identity; torching a cross;
flashbacks of you - back so straight, 
sitting on the bus seat like you were 
moulded in place, staring straight ahead.

Though we were miles away, in a different 
country - and, to some degree, a different 
world - we were all with you.  We 
felt the anguish.  We felt the hot tears.  We 
felt despair. In our hearts and in our heads, 
we were with you.  We stood in our living 
rooms in Nova Scotia and marched down 
the streets of Alabama with you and yours.  
We hooked arms with the other marchers 
and sang We Shall Overcome with Rev. Dr. 
Martin Luther King.  We felt your sadness, 
anger, and hurt when we sat in our homes 
in Canada, witnessing the assassinations 
and attending the funerals of JFK, Robert 
Kennedy, and Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King.

Though we lived so many miles, and a 
few years, apart, I thought of you often 
over the years.  Whenever I think of interesting 
people, and those who have actually 
made a difference, you are at the top of my 
list.  You helped change the face of history.  
You helped change the face of the hero, 

who was usually thought of as a White 
male charging to some damsel's distress.  
You gave us the picture of a hero as a 
strong, young, brave, Black woman who refused 
to be intimidated by hate and ignorance.

I want to thank you, Ms. Rosa Parks, for 
thinking with your feet that day, as well as 
with your head and heart; for giving your 
tired, aching feet the rest they deserved.

I want you to know I admire and respect 
you.  I am so fortunate I have people I can 
be proud of and who can inspire me.  My 
mother has inspired me all my life, and 
you have also inspired me.

God was good to use you in that way, on 
that day.  Lives have been changed and history 
made.  And not only lives and history 
in the United States, but also lives and history 
in towns and cities and rural communities 
in Canada.  I know because it 
touched my life, right here in Granville 
Ferry.  It strengthened me.

 You are certainly worthy of the title 
Hero, and I hope God continues to bless 
and use you.

 Sincerely and respectfully,
Shirley

Mount honors Parks
Pioneer credits 
faith, helpers
By CHRISTINE DOUCET
Staff Reporter

The mother of the modern-day 
civil rights movement now has a 
degree from Mount Saint Vincent 
University.
Rosa Parks - who in 1955 
refused to surrender her seat on 
an Alabama bus to a white man, 
igniting an America-wide civil 
rights protest - was given a 
doctorate of humane letters in a 
special convocation Sunday.
But Mrs. Parks downplayed 
the role she has played in 
American history.

""It wasn't so much what I 
accomplished.  I had a lot of help
and a lot of faith,"" the 85-year-old 
told members of the media 
after the ceremony.
Hundreds of people turned 
out for the packed, two-hour-long 
event, which was scattered 
with standing ovations and musical 
and verbal tributes to Mrs. Parks.
""I don't know if you realize the 
effect you have on people,"" said 
Kimberley Williams, a member 
of the Provincial Baptist Youth 
Fellowship.
""But I know when I saw you at 
the airport, my heart warmed 
instantly.  I was proud to be a 
young black woman.""
When Mrs. Parks was arrested 
in 1955, black people 
were required by law to give up 
an entire row of bus seats for 
any white person.  Tired after a 
day of work as a department 
store seamstress, she refused.
As a result of her arrest, black 
people boycotted the city bus 
line for 381 days and staged 
protests across the country.
""We talk about people standing 
up for what they believe in.  
Rosa Parks sat down for what 
she believed in,"" said Sheila 
Brown, president and vice-chancellor 
of the university.
But more than 40 years after 
Mrs. Parks's defiant demonstration, 
racist attitudes still exist, 
said Carolyn Thomas, an organizer 
of the Nova Scotia Pathways 
to Freedom conference, a youth 
gathering held in Halifax over 
the weekend.
She berated the Daily News 
for publishing a racist comment 
Sunday made by an onlooker 
when Mrs. Parks arrived at the 
Halifax airport.
""I want to assure Mrs. Parks 
that the statement in the Daily 
News today is not in the heart of 
Nova Scotians,"" said Mrs. Thomas, 
whose remarks were followed 
by a standing ovation.
Mrs. Parks thanked Mrs. Thomas 
for making it known that 
""people have not done just what 
they should.""  But she said she 
felt at home in the area.
""I'm enjoying my visit here so 
very much and I'd like to 
continue to be friends with all of 
you.""
Although Mrs. Parks said 
attitudes have improved during 
her lifetime, many young people 
still have a way to go.  She said 
she'd like to see black youth 
assume greater leadership roles 
in their communities.
""The biggest challenge for 
youth is that they be very 
conscientious about their lives 
and that they will be willing to 
get a wonderful and full education."""

Crowd welcomes rights icon
Rosa Parks in metro to receive honorary degree from Mount Saint Vincent
by SUE COUESLAN
The Daily News

As the song says, thank you, 
Sister Rosa.
An 85-year-old black woman 
caused quite a stir at the Halifax 
International Airport yesterday. 
Rosa Parks, known as the 
mother of the American civil-rights 
movement, arrived to a 
crowd of more than 100 people, 
all anxious to see her. 
""From the cradle and right on 
up, we're here and excited about 
this good news,"" said Carolyn 
Thomas, co-ordinator for the 
Nova Scotia Pathways Committee. 
""Thank you, Miss Rosa, you 
are the spark, you got our people 
moving, thank you Sister Rosa 
Parks,"" was the chorus of the 100 
Pathways youth and chaperones 
who greeted her in the airport. 
Parks whose refusal to give up 
her seat to a white man on an Alabama 
bus in 1955 changed history 
for black-white relations, is in 
Halifax to promote her program 
for youth.

Honorary degree today
Today she will receive an honorary 
degree from Mount Saint 
Vincent University. 
The Pathways program aims to 
educate and develop the potential 
of young black students. Youth 
from Nova Scotia and the United 
States are in the middle of a training 
and history tour to learn 
about the history of blacks here. 
Parks, smiling warmly, accepted 
a bouquet of roses from four-year-old 
fan Ikenna Ohanaka. 
""I'm going to give [Mrs] Parks the 
flowers,"" he said before Parks arrived. 
""I got a new hair cut for this."" 
Members of the RCMP and airport 
security kept crowds back 
as Parks, her four guards, Ohanaka, 
and members of her staff 
slowly walked through the arrivals 
area to a waiting limousine. 
Parks's security team, which 
accompanies her on all public appearances, 
has been here since 
Tuesday preparing for the visit. 
Not everyone in the airport 
was there to see Parks. Some 
voiced their opinions to those in 
earshot. A tall man in the crowd 
with an American accent said 
with a chuckle, ""All this for just 
another old n---r."" 
Parks stopped to greet a senior 
citizen in a wheelchair. Travelling 
from Buffalo, Theresa 
Bourque said an attendant mentioned 
there was a bit of a delay 
because Parks was there. 
""We were waiting and she 
went by and just shook my hand. 
It was a thrill. It's nice to meet 
someone you hear so much about 
in the papers,"" Bourque said. 
An Antigonish woman couldn't 
believe she was actually seeing 
the legendary Parks.

'It's wonderful'
""It's wonderful. I never thought 
I'd ever meet her,"" Pat Skinner 
said. ""She's just gorgeous. We owe 
our freedom to her. I just thank 
God that I met her; it's amazing."" 
Parks's quick visit to Nova 
Scotia will include a visit to Shelburne 
and Bridgetown today as 
well as the convocation ceremony. 
She's expected to head home early 
in the week.

Rosa Parks 'truly inspiring'

Mounts honors 
rights pioneer
By SUE COUESLAN
The Daily News

Hymns, applause, and deep respect 
filled the auditorium where 
1,000 people gathered to honor Dr. 
Rosa Parks yesterday afternoon. 
Parks was the guest of honor at 
a special convocation at Mount 
Saint Vincent University. 
Bucky Adams and the Symphony 
Brass Quintet played old 
hymns as guests found their seats 
before the ceremony. 
Parks, 85, who has been credited 
with starting the American civil 
rights movement, followed a 
lengthy procession of faculty, 
guests and members of a Pathways 
to Freedom group, a youth-training 
program she helped develop. 
The two-hour event, dotted 
with musical interludes, included 
heartfelt greetings from the university 
and members of the Nova 
Scotia black community.

Prompted bus boycott
""We talk about people who 
stand up for what they believe in. 
Rosa Parks sat for what she believed 
in,"" Mount Saint Vincent 
president Sheila Brown said to 
laughter and applause. Brown was 
referring to the famous 1955 incident 
when Parks refused to give 
up her seat to a white man on an 
Alabama bus. 
Parks's action led to a 381-day 
bus boycott by the black community 
in Montgomery, Ala., and 
helped bring the issue of racial 
segregation to the fore. 
""Your life, your struggle and 
your commitment to civil rights 
are truly inspiring,"" said Beverley 
Daye.
 Young people were prominent
in the ceremony. Sharrace Higgins-Beals 
had the honor of 
singing a song she composed 
about Parks during the ceremony. 
""You are such an amazing 
woman,"" said Kimberley Williams 
of the Provincial Baptist Youth 
Fellowship. ""I don't if you 
know the effect you have on people, 
but I know when I saw you at 
the airport my heart felt warm instantly, 
and I felt proud to be a 
young black woman."" 
After a standing ovation when 
Parks received her degree, the 
crowd was silent, hanging on her 
every word. ""I'm very, very grateful 
to be here and to receive this 
award ... degree from this great 
college, Mount Saint Vincent University,"" 
she laughed as she fumbled 
for the words. 
""I really am glad to be here and 
I'm glad that we have a large number 
of students from Canada as 
well as the United States,"" referring 
to the Nova Scotian youths 
involved in the Pathways project. 
At a news conference after the 
convocation, Parks received an 
honorary alumni pin and added 
she'd had a wonderful time in 
Nova Scotia. ""I feel I belong here 
as much as any other place; I feel 
at home.""

'Still have much to do'
Parks said the black community 
still has a lot of problems. ""All 
is not where we want it to be. We 
have come a long way; we still 
have much to do."" 
Parks will conclude her visit in 
the next few days, while American 
members of the Pathways to Freedom 
group stay on with their 
Nova Scotian partners to learn 
more about black history in the 
province."

Honoring
Rosa
The real Rosa Parks is much grander
than the mythical Rosa, reported to
have sparked the Alabama bus boycott
because she had tired feet. Larry Fisk
delves into the past that shaped a civil rights legend.

The Associated Press
Rosa Parks gets some help with her shovel at a groundbreaking ceremony for the Troy State University
Rosa Parks Library and Museum in Montgomery, Ala.  The library is to be built at the site where Parks
refused to give up her bus seat to a white rider in 1955.


If you know anything
about American civil rights
and non-violent action you
know that Rosa Parks was
the department store seamstress
who refused to give
up her seat on a Montgomery's
bus on Dec. 1, 1955. By so doing,
she spawned a year-long
bus boycott and campaign
which gave direction, purpose
and success to the civil rights
movement in the American
South.
There is a kind of mythology
about Rosa Parks and it goes
something like this. Her feet
were tired after a hard days's
work and so she refused to relinquish
her seat to a white
male passenger as she was required
to do by Montgomery,
Alabama's segregation laws.
She was arrested for her efforts.
I have found the true story of
this 85-year-old Afro-American
legend to be rather different.
Visiting two metro-area bookstores
I checked the new books
and discovered two on the people
involved in the American 
civil rights movement. I did a 
bit of research standing
amongst the bookshelves and
looking up the name of Rosa
Parks in the index.
In the first book I discovered
that she had attended the Highlander
Folk School in Tennessee
run by Myles Horton, a man
who had devoted his life to interracial
dialogue and democratic
education. So the first
thing I learned was that tired
feet were not the whole story.
Rosa Parks knew what she was
doing. She had received some
civil rights education in the 
tranquil Cumberland mountains
of Tennessee in the months preceding
that critical day in December
'55.
In the second bookstore,
again standing and searching
the index of another new book,
I learned more about Myles
Horton and his alternative
school for helping the poor and
""uneducated"" recognize their
rights and for organizing and
training the leadership for
school desegregation. The
school had been supported by
Eleanor Roosevelt, wife of
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt
(and, many would say,
the heart and soul of his administration);
Walter Reuther,
one of America's most powerful
labour leaders; Norman Thomas,
a leading pacifist-socialist
writer and one of the founders
of the American Civil Liberties
Union; and Reinhold Niebuhr,
one of the most politically influential
theologians in the world
at that time.
So, what might we conclude
from these bits of information?
1. The action of Rosa Parks 
on Dec. 1, 1955 was not simply
a spontaneous reaction. It was
the purposeful act of a disciplined
and intelligent woman.
2. Effective education can
come from a learning environment
quite different from ordinary
schools and classrooms. If
Highlander had anything to do
with Rosa Parks's action, well,
Highlander is a very unique
place in locale, structure and
purpose.
3. Very influential people
gave of their time and money to
make places of civil rights
training like Highlander happen.
Highlander flourished, not
by accident, but because of the
careful and deliberate efforts of
a number of dedicated and
prominent people, although
other high-placed individuals
tried to close it down.
4. It is doubtful whether
Rosa Parks would have learned
what she needed to know and
been able to act as she did, if
she had been dependent exclusively
on formal school and university
classrooms. Segregated
classes were the long-standing
and accepted practice in Alabama
schools and colleges at
the time, like segregated buses
in Montgomery. It is unlikely
that their content would have
encouraged anyone to challenge
that practice and face certain
arrest.
5. Not all useful peace research
goes on in libraries and
think tanks. Some can take
place while standing browsing
in a bookstore!
I have since returned to our
university library and talked to
a few people in various communities
around metro about the
life of this prominent woman
about to receive an honourary 
degree here in Halifax.
It seems that Rosa Parks had
been the secretary to the National
Association for the Advancement
of Colored People as
early as 1943. In that same
year she had been put off a
Montgomery bus for refusing to
follow the usual segregation
practices, by the same bus
driver, remarkably, as had her
arrested in 1955. Had she been
more observant, she claims, she
would never have got on that
bus on Dec. 1, 1955.
Bus drivers, who carried guns,
generally demanded that black
passengers pay their fare at the
front of the bus, get off again
and go around to enter in the
back door. In 1943, Rosa had refused
to do so when she realized
that the back door was already
overcrowded.
Furthermore, after paying
their fares, black passengers
would often find themselves
standing in frustration as the
bus drivers drove away without
them.
For a period of time, Rosa
had worked on a neighboring
military base where all services
were racially integrated by virtue
of President Roosevelt's executive
initiative. Typically,
each day, Rosa Parks would 
board an integrated military
trolley and sit across from a 
white co-worker, chatting with
her and her nine-year old son.
When they departed the base
and boarded the Montgomery
buses, the co-workers would
have to separate.  The confused
look on the nine-year old's face
as to why his mother's friend
would no longer sit across from
them, spoke volumes about the 
injustice and absurdity of the
situation.
Rosa's husband, Raymond,
was considered an ""uneducated""
man. But he was a longstanding
civil rights activist
who encouraged Rosa to educate
and train herself in formal
schools and non-form situations
like the NAACP or workshops
and focused training sessions
like those held at Highlander.
Rosa knew that the NAACP
was looking for a test case to
challenge the legality of bus
segregation. She was involved
in the discussions and correspondence
in the search for  such a plaintiff.
Nonetheless, she insists that
at the moment of her refusal to
give up her seat it never
crossed her mind that she
might become that crucial test
case.
On Dec. 1, 1955, Rosa's only
comment in opposition to her
arrest was to ask of the police,
""Why do you all push us 
around?""
Martin Luther King Jr. later
said of Rosa Parks that her
stand was not part of a planned
campaign or of becoming the
test case. It was, he said, ""her
own intrepid affirmation that
she had had enough. She was
not planted there by the 
NAACP, or any other organization;
she was planted there by
her personal sense of dignity
and self-respect.""
The education of Rosa Parks
came through the support of
family, through the experience
and commitment of NAACP
members, aided by the 
Women's Political Council, her
church, and private tutoring, 
and through the camaraderie of
her peers and the intelligent
training available in the mountains
of Tennessee.
Rosa Louise Parks has remained
a civil rights leader. 
She consistently marched and
worked in the front lines with
Martin Luther King and Ralph
Abernathy. The Rosa and Raymond
Parks foundation was established
following her husband's
death and includes a
Pathways to Freedom program
of leadership training for 
potentially disadvantaged youth
11 to 17 years of age. That program
is extending this year to 
include Nova Scotia by invitation
of the local co-ordinating
committee. If it weren't for 
Rosa Parks's interest in supporting
such an extension she
wouldn't for a moment think of
coming to Mount Saint Vincent
University to receive individual
recognition. Her not-so-ordinary
education wouldn't allow
it.
Larry Fisk teaches peace and conflict
studies at Mount Saint Vincent
University. His is co-editing the book,
Patterns of Conflict: Paths to Peace,
to be published by Broadview Press

Breaking barriers
A living legend inspires
Nova Scotia blacks 

BY BRIAN BERGMAN 

Jamie Sparks is a 24-year-old black 
Haligonian who is making his mark on
the Maritimes music scene. Winner of
this year's East Coast Music Award as 
best Dance/Hip Hop Artist of the Year,
Sparks is preparing to launch his first national 
tour to promote his recently released CD, The
Time.  But despite his success, Sparks, like
many other members of Nova Scotia's black 
community, still endures the everyday sting of
racism. ""Sure, it happens,"" he says, ""it happens 
all the time.  It's not upfront or blatant, but it's 
there."" Sparks talks about going shopping with 
his wife, Richelle, who is white, and having
store personnel follow them around, apparently
fearing he might steal something. On another 
occasion, he and his young son met Richelle in a bus shelter, 
only to have an elderly white woman promptly leave and head down
the street to another bus stop. ""Sometimes people are racist and
don't even realize what they are doing,"" says Sparks.  He adds: 
""Years ago, I think it was a lot worse."" 

Parks: a U.S. civil rights heroine
confronts a legacy of discrimination 

There is, unhappily, a long legacy of racial intolerance
in Nova Scotia. It stretches back over
200 years to the exploitation of former slaves
who arrived in the region in the late 1700s,
through more recent episodes such as the 
1960s bulldozing of Africville--a self-contained 
black community on the shore of Halifax's 
Bedford Basin--and repeated outbursts of
racially motivated violence at the Halifax-area 
Cole Harbour District High School in the
1990s. Given that history, it is little wonder that
the province's black population, which now 
numbers roughly 20,000, is eagerly anticipating
this week's five-day visit to Nova Scotia by a 
black woman who is famous for overcoming
adversity. Rosa Parks, now a physically frail but
still-spirited 85 years of age, is credited with
jump-starting the U.S. civil rights movement
when she refused to give her seat to a white passenger on a segregated
bus in Montgomery, Ala., in 1955. Sparks speaks for many
when he enthuses: ""I think it's great to have someone like her
around this region. It inspires me to know that no matter what you
are up against, you can still come out on top.""

kept thinking about my mother and grandparents and how 
strong they were. I knew there was a possibility of being
mistreated, but an opportunity was being given to me to do
what I had asked of others.""
After her arrest that Thursday evening, word of her
defiance of the status quo spread quickly. The next
evening, Friday, December 2nd, a meeting was held at the 
Dexter Avenue Baptist Church. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
was the pastor. Mrs. Parks trial was held on December
fifth and she was found guilty. A meeting held that evening
assessed the effect of the large numbers of Black people
that had staged a protest that day by not using the buses.
The Montgomery Improvement Association was formed with
Dr. King as its president. The effect of the 381 day boycott
is history. The buses were officially desegregated in 1956.

Parks action had propelled the American Civil Rights"

City of Cleveland
MICHAEL R. WHITE, MAYOR
Welcome to
MRS. ROSA L. PARKS

I am deeply honored to extend this personal and official greeting and cordial
wishes to Mrs. Rosa L. Parks. Mrs. Parks is referred to as the spark for a volatile social
restructuring just waiting to happen. Rooted in the African-American church, the civil
rights movement was lead by church laity, such as Mrs. Parks, as well as the educated
pastorate, such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Reverend Ralph Abernathy. This welcome
takes place at the Karamu House, home to Cleveland's African-American cultural life.
In 1986, at age 75 and 10 years after her husband's death, Rosa Parks co-founded
the Rosa and Raymond Park's Institute for Self-Development. The primary purpose of the
Institute is to provide leadership, mentorship and services that assist youth in realizing
their highest potential.
Mrs. Parks is travelling with students on the Pathways to Freedom project which
her organization developed and sponsors. As students travel the roads which runaway
slaves took 150 years ago, they will begin to deepen their understanding of this portion
of American history. Their experience began in Jackson, Mississippi, travelled the South
and the West, and then up North to cities like Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Maryland;
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Cleveland, Ohio; and Detroit, Michigan, where the program
closes.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, Michael R. White, the 54th Mayor of the City of Cleveland,
do hereby issue this Proclamation of Welcome to Cleveland to this very special person,
Mrs. Rosa L. Parks. As it is your first public appearance in our City, I want to wish you
a pleasant stay with hope that you will return to our five-time, All-America City soon. God
Bless You!
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have set my hand and
caused the Corporate Seal of the City of
Cleveland to be affixed on the 9 day of August
1996.

Rosa
You took a stand, for you knew what was right
Not recognizing you changed our lives
You stood real tall, in that you believed
You changed the course of our nation's history
Rosa we love you with all of our hearts
Our respect for you reflects who you are
A woman of valor we really love you
Thank you for what you've done
You took a stand, not for fortune or fame
Not that the nations would know your name
Now we stand proud of your struggle and your fight
You're more than just a hero,
You're a part of our lives
Your quiet strength empowers within
It lets us know our lives are worth living
You give us hope in this race we must run
Thank you for what you've done

Lift every voice and sing 'till earth and heaven ring
Ring with the harmony of liberty;
Let our rejoicing rise high as the listening skies
Let it resound high as the rolling sea.
Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us
Sing a song full of the hope that the present has
brought us...
Facing the rising sun of a new day begun
Let us march on 'till victory is won!
Stony the road we trod, better the chastening rod,
Felt in the days when hope unborn had died;
Yet with a steady beat, have notour weary feet
Come to the place for which our fathers sighed
We have come over a way that with tears has been watered,
We have come, treading our path through the blood
of the slaughtered,
Out from the gloomy past, till now we stand at last
Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast.
God of our weary years, God of our silent tears
Thou who hast brought us thus far on the way
Thou who hast by thy might - let us into the light,
Keep us forever in the path, we pray.
Lest our feet stray from the places, our God,
where we met thee,
Lest our hearts, drunk with the wine of the world,
we forget thee...
Shadowed beneath thy hand, may we forever stand
True to our God, true to our native land.

In 1955, Rosa Parks refused to give up
her right to sit down on a public bus seat.
Her action led to a bus boycott and sparked an
entire movement. Parks is called the mother of the
civil rights movement. Since then she has become a
symbol for overcoming oppression prejudice and
injustice.
Rosa Parks showed how one individual can
resist an unfair law and change the face of
a nation.

You Are Our Hero!
It might have appeared to go unnoticed.
But we got it all here in our hearts.
We want you to know we would have been nothing
without you.
We want you to know you were our Hero
You were content to let us shine
That Was Your Way!
You always  walked a step behind so we were the
one with all the glory.
While you were the one with all the strength.
Fly, Fly, Fly Away, you taught us to fly.
Thank God, Thank God for you.
You were the wind beneath our wings.
Love Always,
Your Family"

SUNRISE SUNSET
The Traveler
""I was but a traveler here on earth
I was not here to stay,
I was traveling to a land where
God shall wipe all tears away.
I have reached up and grasped
His hand
He is the Truth, the Way 
And He has led my faltering steps
To life's Eternal day.
Then as I enter Heaven's door, 
All cares and burdens past,
I shall be a traveler here no more.
I shall be home at last""
Love,
Lottie (Papouse)

for
Dr. Betty Shabazz

We in the city of Detroit are pleased to have this daughter of the African
diaspora to have cast her shadow of struggle, justice, and the quest for
human dignity upon the people of the world. Detroit has a number of
heroes and heroines. Their very lives have left us a great legacy to
continue the movement toward freedom and justice in our time. We must
continue in the words of Dr. John Henrik Clarke ""To make our mark in
history.""  Dr. Shabazz who married one of the world's foremost freedom
fighters the Honorable El Hadj Malik Shabazz (Malcolm X) did what we
all must do. We must keep the fire of freedom glowing and burning
within the spirit of those who come after us. This woman of the
Tuskeegee Institute, mother, grandmother, visionary and activist of
historic note has filled an important vacuum in our lives. Even in the
midst of her own struggle to maintain family and friends, she managed
to receive her Ph.D., in Health Administration from the University of
Massachusetts. She has certainly reached beyond her grasp and held on
to that which many felt was beyond her level of endurance. Her struggle
in life is reflected even deeper by her commitment to maintain her own
life in what many would never have believed possible. We are glad that
God blessed us with Dr. Betty Shabazz. Yet, even more important than
our being thankful to God for his blessing to us, is that we as a
community continue to be a blessing to each other! In the words of the
old African proverb, ""those whom we love die only in the physical sense. 
Their spirit continues to live on in the will and determination of those
whom they leave behind.""  God's blessings upon Dr. Betty Shabazz and
her family.  Pamoja Tutashinda!  (Together, we will win).

Oh say! Can you see, by the dawn's early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose bored stripes and bright stars, thro' the perilous fight,
O'er the ramparts, we watch'd, were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof thro' the night, that our flag was still there,
Oh say, does that star-spangled Banner yet wave,
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?""

Lift Ev'ry Voice and Sing
Lift every voice and sing
Till earth and heaven ring.
Ring with the harmonies of Liberty:
Let our rejoicing rise
High as the listening skies,
Let is resound loud as the rolling sea,
Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us.
Sing a song full of the hope that the present has taught us.
Facing the rising sun of our new day begun.
Let us march on till victory is won.

The First Lady of the Civil Rights Movement

Rosa Parks refused to give up her bus seat to a white man in 1955.  This sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott of 1955-56, a collective response to decades of intimidation, harassment and discrimination of Alabama's African American population.

September 30, 1996 has been proclaimed Rosa Parks Day in Illinois in honor of Mrs. Parks, a Presidential Media of Freedom winner.  Mrs. Parks' visit to Chicago is part of a tour marking the 40th anniversary of her protest.

Rosa Parks and the Parks Legacy Team actively promote volunteerism and citizenship towards positive change and are raising money for the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute, a nonprofit organization dedicated to arranging scholarships for youth.

STRING QUILT BLOCK #_______

By Margaret Fuller, Box 148, Weiser ID 83672
    My block shows two qualities, faith and love, which those like
you who participated in the civil rights movement had to have. It
also shows a line from the song, ""We Shall Overcome"". I
embroidered the lettering in pink to show the warm sound of 
the voices singing.
    The rest of the motifs on the block are taken from the country
of Mali in West Africa where my daughter, Hilary, was a Peace Corps
Volunteer for two and a half years, from June 1988 through October 
1990. One design shows a tree nursery. Hilary taught people in
seven villages how to make tree nurseries and plant trees. The
tree nursery motif is appropriate for you because the Montgomery
bus boycott acted like a nursery for the civil rights movement.
Another panel has an acacia branch, which is one of the trees 
Hilary's villagers planted most frequently. The abstract designs
are from a hand woven cotton blanket she brought back, and the
boat, a pirogue, is from a wall hanging showing the town she lived
in. The town was Djenne, which is on the river Bani, a tributary
of the Niger.
    I wanted to sew a block for this quilt because my husband and
I participated in a project to do with civil rights in the 1960s.
In 1968, our church at that time, Boone Presbyterian in Caldwell,
Idaho, brought children from the Robert Taylor homes in Chicago for
a month in the summer. During the project we sang the song ""We
Shall Overcome"" a lot. We had an eight year old girl named Aafrika

A variation of the Log Cabin block 

I have read that often ""safe"" houses hung quilts with
log cabin blocks in them on a line or a fence to let runaway
slaves know that the house was a safe haven for them. 

I chose this variation because of its multiple meanings.
So often black people were excluded from the court house
except when being persecuted/prosecuted;  demonstrations took
place on court house steps;  the courts were often the sight
of injustice as well as justice;  laws must be change to give
all people equal rights, regardless of color, gender,
beliefs, life style.  Working together, as many have in
making this wonderful quilt, we will overcome the injustices
and inequality.

Dear Mrs Parks,
This quilt square was stitched in 
memory of Dr Martin Luther King, Jr. I was 
a young girl when I first heard him 
speak, but my ears still hear the 
sound of his voice and my heart the 
passion of his words.
My son, Robert, created the picture 
of children at play while the flowers 
were drawn by my daughter, 
Rebecca. Transforming their art
into a portion of your quilt has 
been a pleasure for us all.
The process of creating this 
square led me through the 
words and writings of Dr King 
as well as others.  I was 
particularly inspired by the 
Highlander Folk School and the 
efforts of people like Septima 
Clark, Esase Jenkins and 
Bernice Robinson.  I decided to add 
the star and names surrounding 
it to recognize the many people 
who, like yourself and your 
husband, have summoned their 
own personal sense of dignity, strength, 
and courage to breath life into ""the Dream"". 
Love,
Chris Fuhrman"

Howdy, Rosa Parks.  I love you.     [* two stacked hearts*] 

As a member of the Rosa Parks Committee, i studied many writings about
your life,  especially your very wonderful book.  ""My Life:  Rosa Parks."" 
It is an honor to be part of the background for your award quilt. 

John 8:54  Jesus answered, ""If I honour myself,  my honour is nothing;  it is
my Father that honoureth me;  of whom ye say,  that he is your God."" 

One of the articles had a sweet picture of you in front of a stained glass
window at the church of the Reverend Martin Luther King. 
You are quoted as saying, "" This is one of my favorite pictures of me."" 

I decided to stitch a square for you that I knew you would really like, so I 
designed it after that picture that you like a lot.  You can visualize the glass 
window radiating the power of the Lord.  Also on the square are sentiments 
of my own.  Around the window as a border I stitched an impassioned plea 
for taxbudgeted PEACE in America, which we all desire. 

In 1980 while I was in Hawaii on mission, I received the revelation that our
Constitution can provide us with a PEACE budget.  In that year and every
four years since then, I run for President of the United States as a write-in 
Merepeace Party candidate on this PEACE platform.  Under the American
Constitution itself,  the President had the power to REFORM the Constitution.
""Congress shall have the power to declare PEACE.""  REFORM Article One
Section Eight to give Congress has the power to declare PEACE.  In this way,
American can budget PEACE directly.  The PEACE budget is a necessity NOW. 

Because of your lifetime of dedicated PEACE work,  I know that you like to
hear about others who have consecrated their lives in the PEACE of Godwill,
PEACE in love.  This PEACE is breath we share.  I am so pleased and
honored to share this time with you, Rosa Parks,  American PEACE hero.

My quilt square is of Betts the independent 
female dog who ran 500 miles from 
Georgia to Virginia.  This single minded 
creature was originally depicted by Harriet 
Powers on her Bible Quilt which she 
sewed in the later 1800's, and was intended 
(according to Afro-American Folk Arts & Crafts) 
as a ""scarcely veiled reference to the path 
of runaway slaves of pre-Civil War days"".
In the four corners are suns and moons 
inspired by Harriet Powers' style. They are 
meant to symbolize the passage of time, not 
only on Betts journey but in the day to day 
struggle of people like Rosa Parks for freedom 
and equal rights.

The design committee for this quilt wanted four large rose blocks,
each different from the others.  Seeking something that would
represent a method of quilt construction used in the past, I 
decided on ""crazy patch,"" which is the random sewing together 
of odd shaped pieces to create a new piece of fabric.  After
several tries, this rose emerged.  Making a block for the award 
quilt for you and quilting on it while enjoying the many beautiful
and thought-provoking images and messages that are part of it has
been a very satisfying experience for me.  I salute you, Rosa
Parks.

Names that passed into history of the Civil Rights 
Movement are embroidered along the edge of 
each rose petal, naming people as beautiful 
and thorny as a rose:  some innocent victims of 
hatred, others courageous, strong in their leadership 
to bring change, some black, some white, Northerners 
Southerners, men, women, children.  Names that need 
to be retold, remembered, repeated, cherished.

Rose Parks, your moment of quiet dignity, determination, 
quiet courage on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama teaches 
what potential we each harbor, what we each can 
create in the name of tolerance & justice.  Voting, 
lobbying, supporting causes with time and money 
are important.  But it is the quiet word, the quiet act 
that truly reach to the soul, the person face to face 
one to the other standing for what we know is right.

This rose is dedicated not only to your decision to 
keep a bus seat but to the rest of your life in 
carrying out charity & justice for others.  Not 
just to one act but to a lifetime of action.  
The black community of Montgomery were 
inspired to support your protest and so I 
feel you inspire us, the quiet ones who 
think our part is too small to matter, 
that we indeed may have some role in 
creating justice & tolerance today.

-My Rosa Parks Square-
Jeanette M. Gorman

From the time I was little I always knew who Rosa 
Parks was and what she represented.  I knew she was 
a symbol representing dignity and the realization that 
we're all created equal.  I knew little else about the 
woman, Rosa Parks.  With my two children we checked 
out some biographies about Rosa from the public library.  
We read them together.
What we learned as we read was the personal 
sacrifice Rosa made to further the struggle from human 
rights.  We learned that Rosa placed a great deal 
of trust in future generations.  Her work with the 
children inspired us to choose a quote from a 
young black woman.
As I stitched the quote:  ""She makes me want to 
believe in myself.  Just because I am black it doesn't 
mean I can't get all I want out of my life.  She 
encourages me to stand by what I believe in and 
not let anyone discourage me.""  I realized Rosa gave the 
greatest gift to millions of [future] children: HOPE.

Dear Rosa,
Greetings!
I created the square with your picture.  It has been 
a very wonderful learning experience!
The picture is a photo transfer which was a new 
technique to me.  I felt so honored when the person doing 
the transfer asked if you were my Grandmother.  I 
felt disappointed to have to say ""No"".
As you can tell by the block, I am not a traditional
quilter.  I appliqued the points rather than doing it 
with the pieced technique.  I am now slowly learning how!
As I worked on your square, I began to vaguely 
remember that part of our Nation's history.  I borrowed 
the PBS show, Eyes On the Prize, and watched most of 
the tapes more than once.  The historical bits and pieces 
from childhood memory began to become clear. I 
can now begin to understand those awful years.
Thank you, Rosa, for being my mentor.
May the quilt bring you much deserved 
love and warmth.

Love, joy and peace,

A Wolf and Little Daughter

One day Little Daughter was pickin some flowers. There was a
fence around the house she lived in with her papa. Papa
didn't want Little Daughter to run in the forest, where there were
wolves. He told Little Daughter never to go out the gate alone.
""Oh, I won't. Papa,"" said Little Daughter.
One mornin her papa had to go away for somethin. And Little
Daughter thought she'd go huntin for flowers. She just thought it
wouldn't harm anythin to peep through the gate. And that's what
she did. She saw a wild yellow flower so near to the gate that she
stepped outside and picked it.

spent many months of hard work pulling all this together;
much more time than I have. But we've all worked together

vision & to fight for what I feel is right. The war
that is being waged right now against Gay, Lesbian, & bi-sexual
people to have cival rights is far from over. But until my
cival rights as a gay man are protected, as for All my brothers
& sisters, and All people fighting oppression, NONE of us will
be free, & the struggle will continue.
Thank you Rosa for all you've done.
With great respect & love Blessed Be
John L. Farrell

Rosa Parks Quilt Square     
An Inspiration

Acting on what we believe brings an inner peace.  A peace
that comes when what we do, agrees with what we think.  It brings
a congruity on which the spirit thrives.  But it may not bring
external peace and it probably won't be the easy road. 

As long as we don't act on our beliefs or speak them aloud,
we can pretend that we all believe the same things;  that we have
no differences of thought or feeling;  the only conflict is
internal and nothing outside ourselves changes.  Yet 
occasionally, when someone with the strength of conviction and
the courage to act, voices those beliefs and acts on them,  those
differences that were hidden and denied, can no longer be
ignored.  Change can occur. 

While the clarity of conviction and the courage to act may
be within each of us, it requires inspiration to be able tto
summon them forth.  That inspiration may come from:  a word, a
sunset, a church, an intolerable situation, or from another 
person.  The story of Rosa Parks is a story of a woman who had 
the courage to act, the courage to refuse to accept a situation 
that was unjust.  Rosa Parks is an inspiration.

The block which I took to sew was one of the long strips that
border the center.  On it I embroidered a poem by Langston Hughes
that compares the civil rights movement to planting a tree so
that all Americans can rest in its shade.

I chose that particular poem because I feel that the civil rights
movement of the late 1950s and early 1960s was an important
turning point in American history.  All Americans are indebted to
you and to the other men and women who demonstrated for freedom
in those years.

As I did background research for this quilt, I was amazed and
impressed to discover how much hard work was involved in
organizing those early marches and boycotts.  I found that beyond
the dramatic moments that the public saw on television or read
about in the newspaper, there were hundreds and thousands of 
ordinary people who drove in car pools, put on bake sales,
mimeographed leaflets, planned meetings, answered telephones --
and ignored threats and personal danger to accomplish their
goals.  I know you did a lot of that background work, both during
the Montgomery bus boycott and in later years when you worked for
Representative Conyers.

This quilt is one little way to say thanks for your lifetime of
work in civil rights.

2. Use bright and contrasting colors. Rosa likes all shades
of pink through magenta and maroon. She also likes blues and 
greens. Please choose your colors to harmonize with the ""old
rose"" color scheme.

3. Save your left-over scraps for the committee to use in
the ""strings"".

4. Photo fabric transfers that stay soft and are quiltable
are fine. Please check with the committee.

Instructions for Block Makers

Please read all instructions before beginning your block.

1. Use only cotton or cotton blend fabrics that are color-
fast and washable. NO KNITS or FELT please.
2. THE QUILTS MUST BE WASHABLE. It is a good idea to wash 
the fabrics you use before starting your block. If you are given
materials in your packet, they are already washed and ironed.
If you have questions about fabric, call someone listed below.
3. Applique, piecing, embroidery or a combination of these
are appropriate techniques.
4. Use only regular sewing thread or embroidery cotton. NO 
YARN. Be sure your embroidery floss is color-fast.
5. Please tie off and cut embroidery threads in the back,
they will show through on some fabrics.
6. Use stitch witchery or fabric glue for tacking only. We
cannot quilt through them!
7. Do not use pens. Appropriate marking pencils that wash
out can be purchased at your fabric store. Test before using 
on your fabric. DO NOT USE BLUE DISAPPEARING PENS. They
come back to haunt you!
8. When using several layers of cloth as in reverse or 
regular applique, trim excess layers of fabric from the back
of block. This makes quilting immeasurably easier.
9. Any overlay fabric must come to the edge of the block or
be finished on all sides within the specified seam allowance.
10. Blocks which do not follow instructions or use improper
fabrics may be altered or sent back to the artist for needed
changes. If the square instructions are not followed
carefully, the squares may be unusable.
11. Embroider your FIRST and LAST name on your block
(posterity, you know.)
12. Block should be washed, ironed and delivered to the
design committee ON OR BEFORE due date. We're not kidding!!
13. Please submit a written explanation of your block (with
your name, address, details describing the block, anything
about why you wanted to participate in this quilt etc.).
These will be used for a scrapbook about the quilt to be
given to the recipient. It helps them to understand the
quilt and feel connected to the quiltmakers. 
14. PEOPLE MAKING QUILT BLOCKS SHOULD MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO
SPEND SOME TIME QUILTING ON THE QUILT TO ENJOY THIS
PEACEABLE, NOURISHING EXPERIENCE. BESIDES, WE NEED YOU!!

Art of Afro-American Quiltmaking:  Origins, Development and
Significance, Maude Southwell Wahlman, 5/80 (I excluded
other String designs because this is what we will use.)

For Rosa Park's quilt we will incorporate scraps from
quilt blocks and from the design of the quilt into the String
boarders, along with the contributed fabric of the string
maker.  The string patches can be between 2 and 5 inches wide
but must be 7 inches on their long edges (includes seam
allowance).  Remember, Rosa likes pinks through maroons and
blues and greens.  The body of her quilt is made up of
checkerboard squares of rose colored fabric and natural
muslin.

The string maker is invited to place quotes, symbols,
creative art onto her strings, if she wishes, along with her
name.  Be sure it's washable.

We need four strings, 7 by 55 inches, and four strings 7
by 64 inches (includes seam allowance).  Please let the
committee know which size string you choose to make."

Rosa Parks is one example of a
woman who made history - she is one of the many women who helped
improve human rights in this country.

I know that black americans are equal to white americans. I
know that it took a lot of courage for Rosa Parks and others to
express that. Rosa Parks had that courage and stood up for what
she believed in.

Many, many years ago Columbus proved that the earth is round
but many people ignored that proof and even today in the face of 
overwhelming evidence, there is a group (the Flat Earth Society)
[that] who believe the earth is flat. Likewise, it has been proven
that black people are just as capable and intelligent as white
people, and still many people refuse to accept that black people
are equal to white people. Now it's the responsibility of my
generation to show that there's no room for racism in our
society.

When I grow up I plan to be a doctor and I plan to carry on
what Rosa Parks began by treating any person in need of a doctor,
regardless of the color of their skin. Until that time, I plan
to fight racism in everything I do.

meeting and to quilt. All interested people are welcome.

We quilted your quilt the winter of '91-'92. We invited
members of St. Pauls Baptist Church, Miracle Temple, and of 
the local NAACP, to join us.

We completed the quilt in March, 1992. While awaiting your
award presentation, we proudly displayed your quilt at
schools, churches and quilt shows. On Martin Luther King
Day, 1993, your quilt hung in the Idaho Capitol Rotunda as 
backdrop to the holiday program.

All through this time, messages were being phoned across the
country: Would Rosa Parks like a quilt? What are her
favorite colors? Then; When can she come to Boise to
receive it? Elaine Steele, your companion and aide, was our
contact. She heard from us quite regularly. In Boise, Kathy
Hodges, Joleen Graham and Heidi Read did the phoning.

Now, in April, 1993, you receive your Boise Peace Quilt
Award, and with it, this scrapbook, compiled by Chris
Fuhrman, containing pictures and messages from people who
have helped in the making.

We wish you comfort and joy from our efforts. We look upon
you as a heroine, who was willing to take great risks to 
further the cause of justice and equality in our nation. You
are a fine example to all Americans and to the world. Thank
you, Rosa Parks.

Sincerely,
Pat Hall

Following is a brief history of the making of your quilt: 

On May 18, 1991 the Boise Peace Quilt Project met at my house 
(Pat Hall) for a decision making meeting.  We come together 
at these meetings to decide who our next quilt will honor.
At the meeting,  the group is presented with suggestions by 
various members and friends.  A young man by the name of John 
Farrell presented your name,  Rosa Parks.  Through the 
democratic process of consensus,  with consideration for all 
the proposals,  the members then decided to honor you.

With that decision,  a committee was formed and the process of 
quilt making was put into action.  We,  the design committee 
(John Farrell,  Joleen Graham,  Kathy Hodges,  Elizabeth Jay 
Jaqi McClellan,  Mira and I),  decided we needed to learn more 
about Afro-American quilt design and more about you,  so we 
headed for our local libraries,  three in number (city,  state, 
university),  and even sent to Portland for a special research 
paper and book to help us.

We had weekly meetings for six weeks,  discussing and sharing 
information.  Designs were proposed and modified.  In our 
zeal,  we tried to incorporate into one quilt much of what we
had learned.  So you see, you have a complex quilt.  Not only 
did we try to tell some of the stories of the Civil Rights
Movement,  the history of Afro-Americans,  your story,  but, 
also,  we wanted to use what we learned about the craft of 
Afro-American quilt making.

We learned that a block design called ""flying geese"" is an 
ancient universal African symbol meaning ""journey"".  This 
symbol ""journeys"" around your quilt to honor the many who 
walked in the Montgomery protest.

We started from the center of the quilt and worked out.  Such 
popular Afro-American patterns as ""checkerboard"",  ""nine 
patch"",  ""flying geese"",  ""log cabin"",  ""string"" and ""strip"" are 
here.  We used fabric photo processes,  embroidered messages
and meaningful appliqued symbols (all popular Afro-American 
modes in quilt making).  The roses in the corners are for 
your name.  The back of the quilt is strip,  with rose design fabrics.

The Afro-American community in our area expressed interest in 
this undertaking with gracious willingness to help.

The committee distributed the block and strip assignments and 
eventually collected them.  Each came back created with 
special meaning by the person who made it.  Our committee 
arranged and sewed these together.  We joined the batting and 
the backing (made by Jinny DeFoggi) with the top,  and put the 
quilt on the frame."

myself most moved by the fact that they have largely been the work of 
women's hands making do with what is available to wrap their families in 
warmth and beauty.  Working on this quilt I learned that African American 
women brought their own special interpretation of artful resourcefulness 
to the task of making a quilt top from the sewing basket leftovers.  This 
technique is known, at least to me, as ""strip quilting.""  I thoroughly 
enjoyed the process of piecing the tiny uneven rectangles of cloth leftover 
from quilts I have made for my family and other Boise Peace Quilt Project recipients into an original design that, I hope, reflects the African 
American tradition that is its inspiration.
Spending the time that it takes to do a piece like this I had a welcome
opportunity to think about you and the inspiration that you have brought to 
so many .  Actions such as yours take tremendous individual courage.  By 
making a piece for your quilt I am honored to link my life with yours in 
this small way and express my gratitude for your achievement.

Taking steps in whatever direction - to the front, to the back, creating a circle, often, takes courage that we don't even have the time to think about.  We just walk out, doing what needs to be done.  Sometimes that stepping brings jeers, laughter at us or imprisonment.  For me, each little stitch was a prayer of thanksgiving for such a great lady as Rosa Parks, who didn't fret about fear, but simply walked to the front of the bus.

One of the Boise Peace Quilter's mottos 
comes from Pet Seeger, who said, ""We 
will stitch this world together yet.
Don't give up.""
You are this kind of a stitcher, 
Rosa Parks. Your willingness to take 
risks and act for justice has helped 
to stitch - make this world a better 
place (more ""together"").
I have heard you are also another 
kind of stitcher, a seamstress.  The block 
I made for your quilt is a sewing 
machine with a rose (for Rosa).  This 
block honors that part of your life, too.
Having sewed clothes for my family, 
mended and used a sewing machine for many 
projects, I have a high regard for the 
skills of a seamstress.
So your block has two meanings, the 
first in the sense of Pete Seeger's motto, and 
the second to remind those who see it that 
you have the skills of a seamstress.
Thank you for being such a wonderful 
example.  Your friend,  Pat Hall"

Dear Rosa,
My strip on this quilt is 
really fabric thank-you 
note for the work you've 
done.  The magic of that 
historic gesture was the 
vision of what it's possible 
for one person with good 
sense & courage to do — it's 
a challenge & encouragement 
to every human being who 
hears of it.  I've come to realize 
that of course what you did 
did not occur in a vacuum.  It 
was prefaced by intention and 
made effective by many others' 
hard work.  I hope you will have share 
our thanks (& even the quilt) 
with them too if you can.
Love, Heidi Read"

Lift Ev'ry Voice and Sing
(Black National Anthem)
by James Weldon Johnson

Lift Ev'ry Voice and Sing, ""Til earth and heaven ring
Ring with the harmonies of liberty
Let our rejoicing rise, high as the listening skies
Let it resound loud as the rolling sea
Sing a song
Full of the faith that the dark past has taught us
Sing a song
Full of the hope that the present has brought us
Facing the rising sun
Our new day begun
Let us march on 'til victory is won
Stony the road we trod, Bitter the chastening rod
Felt in the days when hope unborn had died
Yet with a steady beat, Have not our weary feet
Come to a place for which our father signed?
We have come
Over a way that with tears have been watered
We have come
Treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered
Out from the gloomy past
'Til now we stand at last
Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast
God of our weary years, God of our silent tears
Thou who has brought us thus far on the way
Thou who has by thy might, led us into the light
Keep us forever in the path we pray
Lest our feet
Stray from the places our God where we met thee
Lest our hearts
Drunk with the wine of the world we forget thee
Shadowed beneath thy hand
May we forever stand
True to our God true to our native land"

The Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development's programs are
predicated on the preservation of the historical accuracy's of event that occurred
around the underground railroad, the civil rights movement. Programs
in Science and Technology keep the Institute focused on the future. Special
emphasis is given to Mrs. Parks' arrest on December 1, 1955 and that symbolic
day, December 5, 1955, the beginning of the Montgomery Bus Boycott.
The programs are based on the philosophies of Rosa and Raymond Parks
which demonstrated dignity with pride, courage with perseverance and power
with discipline. This is the cornerstone of the Institute's Program Focus.

Student leaders and support teams from various ethnic and socioeconomic
backgrounds investigate life through social interaction, sports, workshops, 
seminars, panel discussions and technical programs. A holistic approach is
maintained in all activities.

During Pathways to Freedom the students are allowed to become amateur
scientist and mathematicians as they trace the underground railroad through
the civil rights movement and beyond. The Pathways theme is: ""Where Have
We Been? Where Are We Going? The sciences such as: Astronomy, Botany,
Homeopathic medicine, Pharmacology and Zoology are used explain who
the enslaved people healed and protected themselves on their journey to freedom. 
Mathematics is used to teach the students how to budget their resources.

Parents form partnerships with their offspring's and other youth to make learning 
a family affair. Young students focus on self improvement by graphing
their growth and maturity in communications, journals, networking, budget 
management, etc. Parents learn to be supportive through positive dialogue 
and activity. Etiquette, body language, appearance and attitudes are researched, 
demonstrated, and incorporated into the development of leadership and marketable 
skills. Parents learn the same in parenting groups and then partner 
with the youth. Written pre and post tests are evaluated and provided for each 
student. A progress profile in graph format is reviewed weekly during Pathways 
to Freedom. Parents monitor their individual progress as they become 
skilled in the use of new technologies.

The Institute has developed creative education and training approaches which
enhance the youths' marketable skills, thus enabling them to become contributing, 
productive citizens.

The Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development, was co-founded
in February 1987 by Mrs. Rosa Parks and Ms. Elaine Eason Steele, in honor
of Raymond Parks (1903 - 1977). It is the living legacy of two individuals
who committed their lives to civil and human rights.

Raymond Parks married Rosa McCauley December 18, 1932. He was a barber
from Wedowee County, Alabama. He had little formal education but a 
thirst for knowledge and a no nonsense approach to life. He supported his 
wife's 'Quiet Strength"" and encouraged youth to get a good education to support
themselves, their families and to eliminate discrimination in this country.

Elaine Eason Steele, met Mrs. Rosa Parks at work in a sewing factory, in the 
early 1960's while still a high school student. Following graduation she volunteered 
to work with Mrs. Parks and help in any meaningful way she could.
She became a good friend, like the daughter she never had. Elaine also knew 
Mrs. Parks wanted to honor Mr. Parks and knew of her love and commitment
to youth. In 1987, they began the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self
Development.

The era of legalized racial segregation caused Raymond's and Rosa's commitment
to first class citizenship for people of color. Self taught with minimal
formal education, Raymond was a skilled barber. Rosa, a domestic worker
and seamstress, finished high school after her marriage to Raymond. They
both encouraged others to register to vote, pool their financial resources, advocate for quality formal education and become involved in community development.

Rosa Louise McCauley Parks, was arrested December 1, 1955, in Montgomery,
Alabama, for refusing to give her seat to a white male passenger on a 
segregated bus upon the demands of the bus driver. Four days later, December
5, the Montgomery Bus Boycott began and lasted 381 days. Mrs. Parks'
courage catapulted her into world history where she is affectionately referenced 
as the ""Mother of the Modern Day Civil Rights Movement."" The boycott 
also brought world prominence to a young Baptist Minister, Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr. Today, Mrs. Parks continues the work she and her husband,
Raymond undertook throughout their lives with youth in the community and
throughout the world.

The Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development believes in
the community. There is strong reliance on involvement of volunteers in
program development and implementation. The use of human resources to 
generate a community center environment gives young people direct contact
with role models and also provides a sense of support, ownership, and commitment among all involved.

An Overview of
The Rosa L. Parks Learning Centers

The Rosa and Raymond Parks institute for Self Development has developed a program
where youth mentor seniors in a peaceful environment. Preferably in their local communities.
This is done through the Pathways to Freedom by developing and improving life and
academic skills. Youth between the ages of eleven through seventeen, from all socioeconomic
and ecumenical backgrounds perform educational and historical research. The theme is,
""Where Have We Been? Where Are We Going?""

The intense volunteer training program for students is constructed in a structured environment
of mutual respect, etiquette, and team support. Areas of concentration include, but are not
limited to: Computers, History, the Natural Sciences, Effective Communication, Spiritual
Growth, and Health Awareness. All participants, improve basic skills and personal growth.
Networking with seniors is strongly encouraged.

This program teaches life skills. This is done in a practical and realistic way. This allows for
continuity of the ""Rosa Parks"" philosophy and prepares students for for the future.

""We must teach children to prepare for the future - how to set goals
for their lives and for their careers. We must do more to inspire, train,
and motivate them. They need effective role models to help them
develop strength of character. They should be taught to understand
the difference between knowledge, feeling, and behavior. Rather than
be so hard on them , we should instead set an example  for them to
follow. Here are seven key areas we can use:
-Treating all youth with love and respect, setting good examples for them,
supporting social behavior and correcting negative behavior.
Helping all young people  to know one another as persons and to respect and
care about one another.
-Teaching values by using the rich content of history, literature, and The Bible.
-Showing young people how to develop the ability to work hard and to do the
best that they can do.
-Encouraging youth to work together so they can see the value of cooperating
with others for a common good.
-Guiding young people in experiences that show them how to solve problems
without conflict, and force.
Providing opportunities for youth to perform school, home, community services.""

Everything must change (as with the seasons). We are like the seasons, (the young become the

An Overview of Pathways to Freedom

Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development has sponsored its Pathways
to Freedom program annually since 1989.  Pathways to freedom is a multi-cultural program designed for youth ages 11 through 17 from all socioeconomic and ecumenical backgrounds throughout the USA, Canada, and guest countries.  The program's theme is ""Where Have We Been?"" ""Where Are We Going?""

Pathways to Freedom brings the history of the Civil Rights Movement to life and empowers 
today's youth with the skills to work for human rights in all areas. The program is ongoing in 
local communities throughout the year. Each summer, the program culminates in a regional, 
national, and international journey to perform extensive educational and historical research. 
The students and chaperones trace the Underground Railroad into the Civil Rights Movement 
and beyond, traveling primarily by bus.

The intensive training program is structured to build team support as well as self-reliance. 
Both students and chaperones voluntarily participate in an environment of mutual respect, 
etiquette, and self awareness.  Areas of concentration include,  but are not limited to Cultural 
Diversity, African-American History, Civil Rights History, Computer Technology, Natural 
Science, Effective Communication, Spiritual Growth, and Health Awareness.

Pathways teaches life skills in practical and realistic ways. The program instills values 
and cooperation and builds character via goal setting, problem solving, and other directed activities. 
During the annual freedom ride all participants, youth and chaperones, improve basic 
mechanical skills in writing and math, through daily journals and personal budgets.  Networking 
with peers, local and national leaders, is strongly encouraged. The Pathways students and 
chaperones reside with host families, in dormitories, and in hotels to commemorate facilities that
were available to African-Americans before and after legalized segregation. At the end of the 
freedom ride, the students express their appreciation and highlight their experiences in writing 
to the chaperones, facilitators, and to the Institute staff and co-founders. They must also actively 
share their knowledge and experiences in public forums in their local communities after 
returning home.  The youth must send their new friends and acquaintances thank you notes and
or letters. Lodging is included in the regional, national and international programs.

Mrs. Rosa L. Parks is fondly referred to as the ""Mother of the Modern Day Civil Rights 
Movement"".  She is co-founder of Rosa & Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development along with Ms. Elaine Eason Steele. Mrs.  Parks meets and encourage the freedom riders during their journey."

The Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for self Development will
sponsor a series of events December 1-5th commemorating the
Montgomery Bus Boycott. Annually these programs are held to
remember and educate about the contributions of Mrs. Parks
and others to the civil rights history.  This year's ""Own the
Business""  is a campaign directed at young people to motivate
them to become business owners. ""It is our hope, said Ms. Anita
Peek, that others will be inspired to support young people in the
same way as Mrs. Parks.  She has been consistent over her life
time in reaching out to include youth in opportunities that have
been extended to her.""  The foundation of all Rosa and
Raymond Parks Institute's programs reflect Mrs. Park's
philosophy, spirit, and commitment to the education of youth.

""We have designed this effort in direct response to the concerns
expressed regarding economic development in the Black
community.  If we start by helping our young people understand
their power as consumers, we can create a new way of thinking
and change behavior"" said Lila Cabbil, coordinator for the
program.  To honor the 44th anniversary of the Montgomery Bus 
Boycott, 44 busloads of people have been invited to come to the
Martin Luther King Educational Center Gymnasium from 9:30 -
3:30 on Saturday, December 4, 1999 to purchase goods and
services at a marketplace featuring all youth vendors (young
people11-20 years old). Workshops will run concurrently.  The
public is invited to join this effort.

We stand on the shoulders of these women of the movement. When Mrs.
Parks remained in her seat in 1955, these women were trailblazing in their
communities or being groomed to receive the touch

MRS. ERMA HENDERSON, The first African American women to become the 
president of a City Council in a major U. S. city. The major city was Detroit.

MRS. JOHNNIE CARR, Mrs. Carr is the president of the MIA (Montgomery
Improvement Association), the organization that led the Montgomery Bus
Boycott following the outlawing of the NAACP in Montgomery. She and Mrs. 
Parks have been friends since the 6th grade.

Charity Motors, a non-profit organization, is the largest car
donation program in the state. The donor determines which
charity benefits from their giving...Hence Charity Motors.
The more cars that are donated the more funds Charity Motors
can donate to area charities like the Rosa and Raymond Parks

Rosa Louise Parks is nationally recognized as the
""Mother of the Civil Rights Movement"".  Her refusal to
surrender her seat to a white male on a Montgomery,
Alabama bus, December 1, 1955, triggered a wave of
protest that reverberated across the nation.  Her single
act of defiance against injustice and her subsequent
arrest changed American history.
After Mrs. Parks' arrest, people of all races organized a
boycott, which lasted 381 days.  Dr. Martin Luther King,
Jr. served as spokesperson for the protesters,  He
advocated non-violence.
In 1987 she co-founded the ""Rosa and Raymond Parks
Institute for Self Development"" in honor of her late
husband.  The goal is to motivate young people to 
achieve their greatest potential.  Mrs. Parks speaks to 
young people around the country about the importance
of researching the lives of other contributors to world
peace.  
Mrs. Parks has written four books and has received
numerous honorary degrees, plaques, awards and other
accolades.  In 1996 President Clinton awarded Mrs. 
Parks the ""Medal of Freedom"" (the highest award given
to a civilian).  On June 15, 1999 Rosa Parks will receive
the Congressional Gold Medal.

For the last six years, each summer, the Parks Institute has sponsored one of the
most formative programs for youth in America today, Pathways To Freedom.
Selecting multi-cultural registrants age 11 - 17 from across the country based
solely on their commitment to learn more about our nation's past, freedom 
seekers travel by bus to significant historical stops along the old Underground
Railroad, where they have an opportunity to review and research history via
seminars, workshops and actual freedom marches.  Built around the theme, 
""Where have we been.  Where are we going?""  Pathways provides a valuable
historical link between post-Civil War freedom, the onset of the Civil Rights
Movement and our nation's future. Pathways stops for 1996 will replicate the
following 1995 schedule.

AT CHURCH OF TODAY DURING SUNDAY SERVICES 
CONDUCTED BY SENIOR MINISTER GUY LYNCH 

CONTACT:  Jean Callaghan 
(810)  258-5547 

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 

October 9, 1995, Detroit, MI --- Guy Lynch, senior minister of
Church of Today, will team-up with Rosa Parks, nationally 
recognized as the mother of the modern - day civil rights movement,
for a question and answer session on Sunday, October 22 at the
Church of Today.  The guest appearances by Rosa Parks are scheduled 
for both the 9:00 am  and 11:00 am Sunday services and will address 
current issues such as human worthiness and the continued need to
build racial harmony. 

Church of Today serves thousands of people throughout
metropolitan Detroit and is respected for teaching practical
Christianity by offering real life spiritual principles through its 
Sunday services, community outreach programs and high-profile guest 
speaker series. 

Rosa Park's visit coincides with the 40th anniversary of the
civil rights movement (1955-1995);  which originated with her 
refusal to surrender her seat to a white male passenger on a 
Montgomery, Alabama city bus.  This incident has come to symbolize
her strong belief in a person's worthiness and her intolerance for
social injustice.  Rosa Parks remains active 40 years later as the
co-founder of the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self-
Development, among other endeavors. 

Church of Today is located at 11200 E. Eleven Mile in Warren,
MI and is also accessible by taking the Van Dyke exit off I-696
and staying on the service drive for approximately 1/2 of a mile. 

For further information, or to schedule an interview with Guy
Lynch and Rosa Parks, contact Jean Callaghan at (810) 258-5547.

Positive leadership is as necessary today in America and the world as it was on 
December 1, 1955... possibly even more vital.  Mrs. Parks message of equality 
and justice represents a common ground on which American and the world can
build a bright future.  A common ground rooted in past successes and the
knowledge that there is much work yet to be done.  Clearly, Mrs. Parks, a
national icon, is a positive leader beyond reproach. 

Following is a delineation of sponsorship levels and benefits by which you can 
support Mrs. Parks in her quest for justice for all people.  Few Americans
possess her ability to move people, and shape their attitudes and beliefs. A
decision to support Mrs. Parks is a decision to effect positive change, and a 
decision to influence the future of the world.

An aggressive, two-tiered telemarketing program is scheduled to begin in the
first week of November 1995 and run through the duration of the 381 day
celebration.  Phase One of the program involves the solicitation of funds from 
corporations who want to contribute outside the parameters of our identified
sponsorships.  The Rosa Parks Limited Edition Phonecard will be used to fulfill 
corporate donations as follows. 

Pledge     Fulfillment

A comprehensive media  plan incorporating television, radio, newspaper,
outdoor, print, and mass transit is being developed to promote the 40th
Anniversary Kick-off and subsequent events.  Sponsorship dollars will help
support media buys at the national, regional and local levels.  Specific
merchandise (Book, CD, Phonecards, Figurine, etc.) will be supported by
independent marketing budgets. 

A Press Kit, to be direct mailed to approximately 4000 television and radio
stations, newspapers and magazines is near completion and will contain the
following. 

Historical Overview of Events
Press Releases for all 40th Anniversary Events and Programs 
Official Rosa Parks 40th Anniversary Logo Sheets
A selection of color and black & white photographs 
A collection of audio sound bytes 
A collection of film and video clips
An information sheet identifying contacts for further information 

The anticipated date of release for the press kit is November 1, 1995.  Every

Mrs. Parks appeal to African-Americans is well documented, but particular
attention will be paid to broadening both the domestic and international scope
of her influence.  Specific market segments with enormous potential appeal
include: 

Youth
Women
Hispanics
White Males (21-35) 

It is important to note that the demography for Mrs. Parks appeal is truly all-inclusive
and it is the responsibility of this campaign to reach all people here at
home and abroad. 

Research is ongoing to assist in guiding specific strategies to heighten the
overall reach of Mrs. Parks' appeal.  Data bases specified by demographic and
psychographic criteria are available and continue to grow in size and diversity. 
Sampling is currently underway via telemarketing to expand data bases.

awareness, education and self-discovery guided by the Rosa and Raymond
Parks Institute for Self-Development.  Students will have important
opportunities to participate in programmed activities, as well as create their

human rights.

Putting into practice her belief that youth must ""know where they have been in
order to know where they are going,"" the School Countdown will enhance
multi-cultural awareness for Mrs. Parks' teachings."

The story of Rosa Parks is one of the most important and moving in the
Twentieth Century. Her life has touched millions of people and transcended
cultures, race and nationality simply because it is based upon the practical
application of timeless principles. It is the story of a person without prior fame, 
acclaim or status who decided that she could no longer tolerate bigotry and
injustice. Today's media have coined her, "" America's only authentic living
legend.""

The historical backdrop is profoundly unpretentious. On December 1, 1955,
while riding on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama, Rosa parks along with several
other African-Americans was asked to give up her seat so that a white man
could sit down. Others moved, but Rosa Parks did not. She was a woman of
deep spiritual values who tried to live her life based upon Biblical truths.
Knowing these truths, she could no longer tolerate injustice. In fact, she stood
up for her rights by sitting down!

That isolated incidence, during modern times, was the spark that ignited
indignation against injustice throughout the United States and the world. 
Others took up the challenge to change unjust laws. Her boldness, courage and 
persistence inspired the world and changed the course of nations. In many 
ways, Mrs Parks' stance in 1955 was the start of modern day civil rights 
movement. 

Now, fourty years later, a comprehensive project has been developed to honor
her and celebrate the on-going spirit that inspired her actions. Her book "" Quiet
Strength"" has already been published, and now recording artists, television
personalities, and authors are among the countless who have joined together to
contribute their time and money in a unique way to celebrate her life and the
impact it has made on their lives and the world. "

""Too many of today's youths do not know who they are
or where they have been. And as a result, they do not
know where they are going.""

Rosa Parks on Youth
from her book ""Quiet Strength""

Few Americans have made the kind of history that provides us with the sense
of where we are going. The kind of history that stimulates the vitality to
innovate, to overcome...generation after generation. Rosa Parks is one such
American and her legacy remains a template for world change.

So we honor Rosa Parks, who she is and what she stands for, because to study
her life, examine her actions and understand her convictions, reminds us of
who we are and where we've been. Acknowledged as the ""Mother of the
Modern Day Civil Rights Movement,"" Rosa Parks sparked a movement that
forever changed the course of human rights worldwide and laid the
groundwork for all non-violent freedom fighters.

On December 1, 1955, while riding a Montgomery, Alabama bus home from
work, Mrs. Parks was asked to surrender her seat to a white, male passenger in
accordance with the Jim Crow laws. When she refused, her simple act of
defiance and subsequent arrest, touched off a 381 day boycott of Montgomery
buses that ended when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the segregated bus
ordinance to be unconstitutional. Her actions, rooted in her deep spirituality
and love for freedom and justice inspired The Montgomery Improvement
Association (MIA) and its young leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to forever
change the course of history.

Beginning on December 1, 1955 and for the ensuing 381 days, Americans of all
races, creeds and colors will remember and pay tribute to Rosa Parks and her
legacy. And from that knowledge of who she is and where she has been, gain a
greater sense of where we are going. For Mrs. Park's life is a pathway...a
pathway to freedom, justice and equality for us all.

We invite you to celebrate these ""Pathways to Freedom,"" and the Fortieth
Anniversary of The Montgomery Bus Boycott."

One 
of the first women to join the Montgomery, Alabama NAACP Chapter, her quiet refusal to give 
up her seat on a segregated bus to a white man in 1955 ignited the modern-day civil rights 
movement. Her character, integrity, moral courage and fortitude stand as shining proof that one
voice can make a difference. The strength of her convictions empowered a crusade for equality
and justice that endures to this day. Still committed to human rights, Rosa Parks champions 
these ideals through the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development and the Parks
Legacy organizations, which she co-founded to ensure that the lessons and advances of the civil
rights movement are carried forwards for future generations. She continues to inspire people 
throughout the world, young and old alike, through her example.

Antonia Hernandez, President and General
Counsel of the Mexican American Legal
Defense and Educational Fund, has used the 
law, community education, and research to
advance the civil rights of the nation's 24
million Latinos. Throughout her career at
MALDEF, and as staff attorney to the U.S.
Senate Committee on the Judiciary, directing 
attorney of the Lincoln Heights office of the
Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles, and
currently, as Board member of the National 
Women's Law Center, she has played a pivotal
role in expanding the rights of women
and people of color across the country.

Ellen Goodman, author, Associate Editor and
syndicated columnist for the Boston Globe, 
has been a powerful voice for women and families
for over twenty years. Her insight, common
sense, and verbal flair have attracted a
fervent national following - especially among
women's rights advocates. Today, her Pulitzer 
Prize-winning At Large column, syndicated by
the Washington Post Writers Group, appears
in over 440 newspapers across the country. She
speaks out and speaks up about equality, injustice
and the obligation to build on the civil 
rights and women's rights milestones that have
been achieved throughout our nation's history.

The National Women's Law Center
Since 1972, the Center has challenged the law and
the legal system to protect women's rights and to
respond to women's needs. Serving as counsel in 
landmark litigation and an advocate for women and
their families on public policy issues on the federal
and state level, the Center has helped to expand the 
rights of virtually every woman and girl in the country.
Today, the Center continues to fight on issues
critical to women and their families, working to
establish women's economic security, protect
women's reproductive rights, and assure that women
and their families have adequate and affordable child 
care, health care, and educational opportunities to
enhance their lives and the future of our country.

Biographical Sketch
Rosa Louise Parks is nationally recognized as the ""Mother of the Modern Day Civil Rights 
Movement"" in America. Her refusal to surrender her seat to a white male passenger on a Montgomery, Alabama bus,
December 1, 1955, triggered a wave of protest December 5, 1955 that reverberated throughout the United States. Her
quiet, courageous act changed America, its view of black people and redirected the course of history.
Mrs. Parks was born Rosa Louise McCauley, February 4, 1913 in Tuskegee, Alabama. She was the first child of James
and Leona Edwards McCauley. Her brother, Sylvester McCauley, now deceased, was born August 20, 1915. Later, the 
family moved to Pine Level, Alabama where Rosa was reared and educated in the rural school.
When Rosa completed her education in Pine Level at age eleven, her mother, Leona, enrolled her in Montgomery 
Industrial School for Girls (Miss White's School for Girls), a private institution. After finishing Miss White's School, 
she went on to Alabama State Teachers College's High School. However, she was unable to graduate with her class 
because of the illness and subsequent death of her grandmother, Rose Edwards. As Rosa prepared to return to Alabama
State, her mother also became ill. Therefore, she remained home to care for her mother while her brother worked outside
to help support the family.
Rosa married Raymond Parks, December 18, 1932. Raymond, now deceased, was born in Wedowee, (Randolph 
County), Alabama on February 12, 1903. He received little formal education due to racial segregation, but with the encouragement of his mother, Geri Parks, Raymond was a self educated person. However, his immaculate dress and
his thorough knowledge of domestic affairs and current events made most people think that he was college educated. 
He supported Rosa's desire to complete her formal education, and she received her high school diploma in 1934.
Mr. Parks was an early activist in the effort to free the ""Scottsboro Boys,"" a celebrated case in the 1930's. Together,
Raymond and Rosa worked in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). He was 
an active member and she served as secretary and later youth leader of the local branch. At the time of her arrest, she
was preparing for a major youth conference.
After the arrest of Rosa Parks, black people of Montgomery and sympathizers of other races organized and promoted
a boycott of the city bus line that lasted 381 days. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was appointed the spokesperson for the
Bus Boycott and taught non-violence to all participants. Contingent with the protest in Montgomery, others took shape
throughout the south and the country. They took form as sit-ins, eat-ins, swim-ins and similar methods. Thousands of
courageous people joined the ""protest"" to demand equal rights for all.
From 1965 to 1988, Mrs. Parks was employed by Congressman John Conyers. First Congressional District of Michigan.
In February, 1987 she began the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development. The purpose of the Institute 
is to motivate and direct youth not targeted by other programs to achieve their highest potential. Rosa Parks sees the 
energy of young people as a real force for change. It is among her most treasured themes of human priorities as she speaks 
to young people of all ages at schools, colleges and national organizations around the country.
Mrs. Parks has received ten honorary doctorate degrees, hundreds of plaques, certificates, citations, awards and keys to 
several cities. Among them are the NAACP's Spingarn Medal, the UAW's Social Justice Award, the Martin Luther 
King, Jr. Non-Violent Peace Prize, the Roger Joseph Prize from Hebrew Union College, the Pope John XXIII medal 
from the College of New Rochelle and numerous other honors. Rosa Parks: My Story, as told to Jim Haskins, was 
published in 1992.
A quiet exemplification of courage, dignity and determination, Rosa Parks is a symbol to all Americans to remain free."

JUDGE JOHN MINOR WISDOM

Judge John Minor Wisdom, Senior Judge, United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, was born May 17, 1905 in New 
Orleans, Louisiana.

He received his A.B. degree from Washington and Lee University, 1925 and his LL.B degree from Tulane University in 1929. 

He served in the United States Army 1942-1946 and was awarded the LEGION OF MERIT ARMY COMMENDATION MEDAL. He 
practiced law in New Orleans for 28 years in the private firm of WISDOM, STONE, PIGMAN AND BENJAMIN and he also served as Adjunct 
Professor of Law at Tulane University.

Judge Wisdom is a past chair Appellate Judges Conference; life member American Law Institute; Louisiana Bar Association; American 
Bar Association; New Orleans Bar Association; American Judicature Society and the Louisiana Bar Foundation.

Lawyers, describing Judge Wisdom in a legal publication THE TULANE LAW REVIEW said, ""Wisdom is a legend on the Fifth Circuit. He 
is brilliant, gentlemanly and writes beautifully"".  A NEW ORLEANS TIMES PICAYUNE article  described him as ""an unpretentious man, easily 
moved to laughter, who enjoys reading Shakespeare and Marlowe for relaxation.""

After a slow response by southern states to BROWN v. BOARD OF EDUCATION, the landmark school desegregation case, the FIFTH CIRCUIT 
COURT OF APPEALS (which then comprised the present Fifth and Eleventh Circuits) issued four landmark decisions that dramatically altered 
the law on school segregation. Judge Wisdom wrote the opinions in all four cases. 

The much honored, award-winning Judge has authored numerous publications. Among them; ""A SOUTHERN JUDGE LOOKS AT CIVIL 
RIGHTS""; ""REQUIEM FOR A GREAT COURT""; ""A FEDERAL JUDGE IN THE DEEP SOUTH""; ""MY FRIEND AND CHIEF: ELBERT TUTTLE"". 

Judge Wisdom said;

""THE CROWNING GLORY OF AMERICANS FEDERALISM IS NOT STATES' RIGHTS. IT IS THE PROTECTION THE UNITED STATES 
CONSTITUTION GIVES TO THE PRIVATE CITIZENS AGAINST ALL WRONGFUL INVASION OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS."" 

In November, 1993, the United States House of Representatives sent legislation to the United States Senate that renames the Fifth 
Circuit Court of Appeals Building, the JOHN MINOR WISDOM UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE. 

Judge and Mrs. Wisdom live in New Orleans and are the parents of three children, John, (deceased), Kathleen and Penelope.

ROSA PARKS

On Thursday, December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks, a handsome Black Seamtress, caught  a bus in Montgomery, Alabama, and 
rode to her job at the Fair Department store.  It was a pleasant day, but unseasonably warm for December.  When the downtown stores 
closed, black and white people thronged the streets.  When a Montgomery City Lines bus pulled up to its stop, several black passengers 
boarded, including Rosa Parks, who was tired following an exhausting day at her job. 

At the next stop, six white passengers boarded the bus.  The driver asked the black people sitting just behind the white section to 
get up and give their seats to the white patrons. This was an ancient custom which excited no undue comment. Three black persons got 
up immediately but Rosa Parks remained seated.  The driver again asked her to yield the seat but Mrs. Parks, a sweet-tempered, gentle, 
woman, again refused.  She was just too tired to get up.  The driver then summoned police officers who arrested Rosa Parks for violating 
the city's segregation ordinances.

Rosa Parks' arrest did what no other event had been able to do; it unified and focused the discontent of the entire black community. 
The arrest released damned-up deposits of social energy that rolled across the face of the south and the north.  There was a one-day 
boycott of the busses. The one-day boycott stretched out to 382 days.  The 382 days changed the spirit of Martin Luther King, Jr. and 
he, in turn, helped to change the face and the heart of black people, white people and America. 

Mrs. Parks sat down so that America could stand up and make an attempt to put an end to injustice.  Rosa Parks' simple yet 
extraordinary act of defiance led to the end of segregation in the south and changed forever the history of civil rights in America.

Mrs. Parks refusal to move back was intrepid affirmation that she had had enough.  It was an individual expression of a timeless 
longing for human dignity and freedom. She was anchored to that seat by the accumulated indignities of days gone by and the boundless 
aspirations of generations to come.

Mrs. Parks currently lives in Detroit, Michigan and heads the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development which she 
founded along with Elaine Steele in 1987. The Institute seeks to preserve the heritage of the civil-rights movement and to share its 
legacy of human dignity and social justice for all people.  The dignity, courage and perserverance of Rosa Parks will be the impetus of 
leadership for generations to come."

NANCY WILSON

Few vocal artists in contemporary music possess a style so distinctive, a sense of art so timely, and a reputation so critically hailed
as Nancy Wilson. For more than three decades, over the course of more than 50 albums, Nancy has remained at the forefront of her
craft. Her ability to inject a lyric with a certain magic that breathes life into a song has been the key to satisfying legions of long-time fans.
Nancy Wilson has always been lauded as a song stylist supreme.

Born in Chillicothe, Ohio, she was exposed to a wide range of jazz and blues influences as a youngster. As a teen, Nancy participated
in local choirs and dance bands, performed in clubs, and appeared in local television. In 1956, she began working with RUSTY
BRYANT'S CAROLYN CLUB BAND in Columbus, a gig that lasted two years and marked her first recording for Dot Records (highly collectible
today).

In 1959, Nancy moved to New York and earned a night club spot filling in for vocalist IRENE REID. She cut a demo with pianist RAY
BRYANT which won her a contract with Capitol Records and her first single, ""GUESS WHO I SAW TODAY?""

Nancy's first big R&B hit came in 1962 with CANNONBALL ADDERLEY, ""SAVE YOUR LOVE FOR ME,"" followed by ""TELL ME THE TRUTH"" 
in 1963. ""HOW GLAD I AM"" followed in 1964; it won Nancy the ""BEST R&B"" Grammy — and broke RAY CHARLES' four-year stranglehold
on the award. R&B chart hits flowed through the '60's: ""I Wanna Be With You"" (from Broadway's Golden Boy), ""DON'T COME RUNNING
BACK TO ME,"" ""YOU'VE GOT YOUR TROUBLES,"" ""YOU'D BETTER GO,"" CAN'T TAKE MY EYES OFF YOU""; as well as Johnny Mercer's Midnight
Sun.""

Nancy hit the Billboard pop top 30 in 1968 with ""Face It Girl, It's Over,"" and scored another crossover hit in 1970-71 with ""Now
I'm a Woman."" You're As Right As Rain"" was a solid top 10 R&B hit for her in 1974. In all, she charted 33 Capitol albums on the
Billboard Pop chart — from her historic debut with Cannonball Adderley in 1962; to the Grammy-nominated Gentle is My Love in 1965;
up though 1977's I'VE NEVER BEEN TO ME. In addition to her Grammy recognitions, Nancy won an Emmy award in 1975, for her NBC
television series, ""THE NANCY WILSON SHOW."" She won the TOKYO SONG FESTIVAL in 1983. In 1986, she received both the NAACP's
Image Award as ""BEST JAZZ ARTIST"" and the ""GLOBAL ENTERTAINER OF THE YEAR"" AWARD from the World Conference of Mayors.

But music is only a part of Nancy's life. She founded the Nancy Wilson Foundation to provide inner city youth with opportunities
they wouldn't have been able to experience otherwise. Ms. Wilson contributes her time to the MARTIN LUTHER KING CENTER FOR SOCIAL
CHANGE, the NATIONAL URBAN COALITION, the KENNEDY CENTER'S CHAIRMAN'S COMMISSION, the NATIONAL HEART ASSOCIATION, and the
CANCER SOCIETY.
On October 1, 1990, Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley proclaimed it ""Nancy Wilson Day"" as she earned her star on the Hollywood
Walk of Fame."

JUDGE ELBERT P. TUTTLE

Judge Elbert Parr Tuttle served as General Counsel of the Treasury Department in 1953-54. He was appointed JUDGE OF THE UNITED
STATES COURT OF APPEALS for the Fifth Circuit by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in September, 1954, and December 1960, became
Chief Judge of that Circuit and served until 1967. He is now a Senior Judge of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. Judge
Tuttle served as CHAIRMAN OF THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON CIVIL RULES (F.R.C.P.) and CHAIRMAN OF THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON
JUDICIAL CONDUCT (the ethics Committee for Federal Judges) of the Judicial Conference of the United States.

A quiet, modest, somewhat formal, and an unfailingly courteous man who practiced old fashioned virtues (he never smoked or
tasted liquor in his life), Judge Tuttle was never one to compromise his principles. A Lifelong member of an Atlanta church, he
withdrew after his congregation voted to refuse to admit black worshipers. A few years after he went on the court, Tuttle summarized his
philosophy in a commencement address to professional-school graduates at Emory University;

""THE PROFESSIONAL MAN IS IN ESSENCE ONE WHO PROVIDES SERVICE. HE HAS NO GOODS TO SELL... NO LAND TO TILL.
HIS ONLY ASSET IS HIMSELF. IT TURNS OUT THAT THERE IS NO RIGHT PRICE FOR SERVICE, FOR WHAT IS A SHARE OF A MAN
WORTH? IF HE DOES NOT CONTAIN THE QUALITY OF INTEGRITY... HE IS WORTHLESS. IF HE DOES... HE IS PRICELESS.
THE VALUE IS EITHER NOTHING OR IT IS INFINITE.""

On June 11, 1980, the Federal Courthouse in Atlanta was renamed the ELBERT PARR TUTTLE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS BUILDING. President
Jimmy Carter awarded the PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM to Judge Tuttle on January 16, 1981.

Judge Tuttle and his wife Sara, are parents of a son, Dr. Elbert Tuttle, Jr., Atlanta, and a daughter Jane Tuttle Harmon of Rochester,
New York, nine grandchildren and nine great grandchildren. Later this year, in October, Judge and Mrs. Tuttle will celebrate their 75th
wedding anniversary."

Biographical Sketch

Rose Louise Parks is nationally recognized as the ""Mother of the Modern Day Civil Rights
Movement"" in America.  Her refusal to surrender her seat to a white male passenger on a 
Montgomery, Alabama bus, December 1, 1955, triggered a wave of protest December 5, 1955, that
reverberated throughout the United States.  Her quiet, courageous act changed America, its view of 
black people and redirected the course of history.

Mrs. Parks was born Rosa Louise McCauley, February 4, 1913, in Tuskegee, Alabama.  She was
the first child of James and Leona Edwards McCauley.  Her brother, Sylvester McCauley, now
deceased, was born August 20, 1915.  Later, the family moved to Pine Level, Alabama where Rosa
was reared and educated in the rural school.

When she completed her education in Pine Level at age eleven, her mother, Leona, enrolled her in
Montgomery industrial School for Girls (Miss White's School for Girls), a private institution.
After finishing Miss White's School, she went on to Alabama State Teacher's College High School.
However, she was unable to graduate with her class because of the illness of her grandmother Rose
Edwards and later her death.

As Rosa prepared to return to Alabama State, her mother also became ill.  Therefore, she
continued to take care of their home and care for her mother while her brother, Sylvester, worked 
outside of the home.  Rosa received her high school diploma in 1934, after her marriage to
Raymond Parks, December 18, 1932.

Raymond, now deceased, born in Wedowee, Alabama, Randolph County, February 12, 1903,
received little formal education due to racial segregation.  He was a self-educated person with the
assistance of his mother, Geri Parks.  His immaculate dress and his thorough knowledge of
domestic affairs and current events made most think he was college educated.  He supposed and
encouraged Rosa's desire to complete her formal education.

Mr. Parks was an early activist in the effort to free the ""Scottsboro boys,"" a celebrated case in the
1930's.  Together, Raymond and Rosa worked in the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People (NAACP's) programs.  He was an active member and she served as secretary and
later youth leader of the local branch.  At the time of her arrest, she was preparing for a major
youth conference.

After the arrest of Rosa Parks, black people of Montgomery and sympathizers of other races
organized and promoted a boycott of the city bus line that lasted 381 days.  Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr. was appointed the spokesperson for the Bus Boycott and taught non-violence to all
participants.  Contingent with the protest in Montgomery, others took shape throughout the south 
and the country.  They took form as sit-ins, eat-ins, swim-ins and similar causes.  Thousands of
courageous people joined the ""protest"" to demand equal rights for all people.

Since 1965, Mrs. Parks has been employed by Congressman John Conyers, First Congressional
District of Michigan.  In February, 1987 she began the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development.  The purpose is to motivate and direct the ""average"" youth not targeted by other
programs to achieve their highest potential.  Rosa Parks sees the energy of young people as a real
force for change.  It is among her most treasured themes of human priorities as she speaks to
young people of all ages at schools, colleges and national organizations around the country.

Mrs. Parks has received numerous honorary doctorate degrees, hundreds of plaques, certificates,
citations, awards and keys to several cities.  Among them are the NAACP's Spingarn Medal, the
UAW's Social Justice Award, the Martin Luther King, Jr. Non-Violent Peace Prize and most
recently in May of 1987, the Roger Joseph Prize with a cash award of ten thousand dollars, from
the Hebrew Union College.

A quiet exemplification of courage, dignity and determination, Rosa Parks is a symbol to all
Americans to remain free.

CONGRESSMAN KWEISI MFUME
CHAIRMAN
CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS

The Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) was formed in 1970 when the 13 Black Members of the U.S. House of Representatives
joined together to strengthen their efforts to address the legislative concerns of Black and minority citizens. African-American
Representatives had increased in number from six in 1966 to nine, following the 1969 elections.  Those Members believed that a Black
Caucus in Congress, speaking with a single voice, would provide political influence and visibility far beyond their numbers.

The Caucus received its first national recognition when its Members met with former President Richard Nixon in March, 1971
and presented to him a list of 60 recommendations for governmental action on domestic and foreign issues.  The President's response,
considered inadequate by the Caucus, further strengthened their efforts to work together in Congress.

Today, there are 40 Black Members of Congress, ten women and thirty men representing many of the largest and most
populated urban centers in this country, together with some of the most expansive and rural Congressional districts in the nation.  These
Members, now as in the past, have been called upon to work as advocates for America's varied constituent interests - developing an ever
expanding legislative agenda - as well as addressing the concerns of their own particular districts.  Additionally, the '92 elections 
yielded the second African American Senator of this century and the first African American woman, Carol Moseley-Braun.

The visions and goals of the original 13 Members, ""to promote the public welfare through legislation designed to meet the needs
of millions of neglected citizens,"" have been reaffirmed through the legislative and political successes of the Caucus.  The CBC is involved
in legislative initiatives ranging from full employment to welfare reform, South African sanctions and international human rights, from
minority business development to expanded educational opportunity.  Most noteworthy is the CBC Alternative budget which has been
produced for the past 13 years.  The Caucus seeks to preserve a national commitment to fair treatment for urban and rural America, the
elderly, students, small businesspersons, middle and low-income wage earners, the economically disadvantaged and a new world order.

Additionally, the Caucus received national attention with its presentation of a major urban funding package delivered in response to
the Los Angeles uprising. In the 102nd Congress, CBC Members introduced more than 400 individual bills and co-sponsored an
unprecedented 11,000 legislative measures.

In the twenty-three years since its founding, Caucus Members have been successful in rising to strategic positions on House
committees to affect needed changes in federal policies.  A CBC Member holds the office of Chief Deputy Whip of the House of
Representatives, three African Americans chair full House standing committees, and thirteen Caucus Members hold Subcommittee
Chairmanships.

Democrat and Republican, they are the ""conscience of the Congress.""  Congressman Kweisi Mfume (MD-7) is Chairman of the
Congressional Black Caucus.

Tonight, we honor two of the most valiant 
and courageous jurists of our times... Judge Elbert 
Parr Tuttle and Judge John Minor Wisdom.  Judges Tuttle 
and Wisdom (with fellow judges John Robert Brown of 
Texas and Richard Taylor Rives of Alabama) moved the 
federal judiciary in the deep south beyond its role as an 
institution of law and make the United States Court of 
Appeals for the 5th Judicial Circuit an agent for change.

The Fifth Circuit judges issued landmark decisions 
that struck down barriers of discrimination in voting, jury 
selection and employment.  They developed the doctrine of 
""affirmative duties"" which shifted the burden from Black 
plaintiffs to school boards to dis-establish a dual school 
system.

Burke Marshall, Assistant Attorney General in 
charge of the Civil Rights Division in the Kennedy 
administration said, ""these judges have made as much of 
an imprint on American Society and American law as 
any judges below the Supreme Court have ever done on 
any court.""

REV. LEON SULLIVAN

Reverend Dr. Leon Sullivan, long time Pastor of Zion Baptist Church in Philadelphia, is one of the most widely admired, 
respected and honored men in the world.  For more than four decades, his has been a voice of bracing moral integrity as he worked, 
untiringly, to motivate, and teach impoverished peoples how to liberate themselves through self-help.

Under his leadership, Zion became the largest congregation in Philadelphia and one of the largest churches in American and serves the 
nerve center for what has become a movement that spread across the United States and now embraces the world.

In the late 1950's, Sullivan led selective patronage campaigns, began a new era of the civil rights movement in Philadelphia, and 
opened up thousands of new jobs for African-Americans.  In 1962, he founded Progress Investment Associates, to build the first and 
largest shopping center owned by blacks in a major urban area, as well as housing and human services complexes.

In 1964 Reverend Sullivan founded Opportunities Industrialization Center (OIC) of America, a program sponsoring training and 
retraining on a massive scale, the first program of its kind in the history of the United States.  Since its beginning, OIC has trained more 
than one million men and women and more than 80,000 have been placed in gainful employment, earning approximately $15 billion a 
year in annual income.

In 1964, he founded the Opportunities Industrialization Centers (OICs).  This network of community-based skills training programs 
has helped more than one million people in 100 U.S. cities, and 12 African nations, find productive employment.

His famous ""Sullivan Principles,"" a code of conduct for firms doing business in South Africa, helped to inaugurate a revolution in 
race relations in that country and marked the beginning of the ""Socially Responsible Investment"" movement in the United States.  Through 
the Sullivan Principles, the number of Black Supervisors in South Africa increased, unions became increasingly recognized, work places were 
integrated, and thousands of Institutional Investors in the United States and other countries withdrew or withheld investments from South 
Africa.

In 1984, he founded the International Foundation for Education and Self-Help (IFESH) to provide vocational skills, and literacy 
and health education to 1,000,000 people in Sub-Saharan Africa by the year 2,000.  By sponsoring bi-annual ""African-African 
American Summit Meetings"", IFESH also promotes U.S. private investment in African countries and closer ties between Africans 
and African-American.

Born October 16, 1922, in Charleston, West Virginia, Reverend Sullivan was educated at West Virginia State College, Union 
Theological Seminary and Columbia University.

Reverend Sullivan's contributions to his nation, and to humanity as a whole, have been broadly recognized.  He is the recipient of 
the President Medal of Freedom - the highest civilian award of the United States Government.  He has received honorary degrees from 35 
Colleges and Universities, and many other national and international awards.

Reverend Sullivan is married to the former Miss Grace Banks.  They have a son, Howard, two daughters, Julie Sullivan-Johnson and Hope Sullivan-Hurley, and three grandchildren."

GORDON PARKS

Born in Fort Scott, Kansas on November 30, 1912, Gordon Roger Alexander Buchanan Parks had to leave home at fifteen, when his mother died. For the next twelve years, he lived mainly in Minneapolis, Minnesota - working as a piano player, bus boy, dining car waiter, Civilian Conservation Corpsman and professional basketball player - before taking up photography in the late 1930's and 
moving to Chicago. 
In 1942 he was awarded the first Julius Rosenwald Fellowship in photography, and chose to work with Roy Stryker at the Farm Security Administration (FSA) in Washington, D. C.  During World War II, he was an OWI (Office of War Information) correspondent. Later he joined Stryker at Standard Oil Company (New Jersey) as a photographer working out of New York City, and living in White Plains, 
New York.  At that time he wrote his first two books on photography and began doing free-lance fashion photography for Vogue and Glamour magazines.
In 1949, he joined the staff of LIFE magazine and worked there as a photojournalist until 1968, doing over 300 assignments and articles on a wide variety of subjects. In the 1960's he became famous for his stories on the leaders of the Black Revolution, articles later incorporated into his book, Born Black.  Gordon Parks continues to write and photograph for LIFE occasionally, while pursuing his many other projects.  He was a founder of Essence magazine, and its editorial director from 1970 to 1973.
His film career began in 1961 when he wrote and directed a documentary, FLAVIO, the story of a boy from a Brazilian slum, which Parks made famous in LIFE and later in a book.  Another famous LIFE story became his second documentary, DIARY OF A HARLEM FAMILY, 1968, for which he received an EMMY Award.

TERRY MCMILLAN

Terry McMillan is known to many readers as one of America's foremost younger writers. On a recent book tour promoting her latest book, ""WAITING TO EXHALE"", anxious buyers waited in long lines to meet her. In Washington, D.C., there were 1500 people lined up; 1200 in Chicago; 2000 in Atlanta; crushing crowds in San Francisco; long curving lines in New York and so the story goes. 

She is doubly admired by other writers for the bold and ambitious way she undertook the marketing of her first novel, ""MAMA"", published in 1987.

Refusing to allow her publisher's advertising budget to result in the usual self-fulfilling prophecy of limited sales and low exposure, McMillan became her own publicist at her own expense, sending out literally thousands of press packets and clippings to reviewers, bookstores, libraries and media people, nationwide. The consequences were an added stir of recognition for the author and an increased flurry of interest in a book that well deserved its rescue from the publishing shuffle. Even without strong reviews, ""MAMA"" sold out its first hard cover printing of 5,000 copies, (a mystery until McMillan explained what she had done).

Born in 1951 and reared in the impoverished Detroit suburb of Port Huron, Michigan, McMillan moved to Los Angeles after completing high school and worked as a secretary for three years before winning a scholarship to the University of California at Berkeley. Graduating with a degree in Journalism, she went on to study film at Columbia University.

When McMillan was a teenager in Port Huron, Michigan, boys were more important than books until she worked as a page at the public library. She was 16 years old earning a $1.25 an hour and thinking the book world, which was new to her, was an exclusively white one. ""Almost every book I used to put up was by a white author. So it never dawned on me that black people wrote books,"" says McMillan. One day she saw a book by James Baldwin and she has written candidly of this epiphany. ""I remember feeling embarrassed and did not read his book because I was too afraid. I couldn't imagine that he'd have anything better or different to say than Thomas Mann, Henry Thoreau, or Ralph Waldo Emerson. Needless to say, I was not just naive, but had not yet acquired an ounce of black pride.""

With this discovery, McMillan began reading but did not start writing. The only book in her home was a rarely used Bible, and her mother, a homemaker, and factory worker, and her father, a sanitation worker, did not read to their five children. In a community college literature class in Los Angeles, where McMillan moved basically on a whim, she read the black classics. ""I was amazed but still it never dawned on me that one day I would be doing this.""

""WAITING TO EXHALE,"" is by any standard, an astonishing success. The novel remained on the New York Times best-seller list for eleven weeks. There were 400,000 copies in print and the paper back rights were sold to a publisher for $2.64 million, one of the highest prices ever paid for a reprint.

Ms. McMillan lives in Northern California with her son, Solomon."

She left the Club to join the Noble Sissle Orchestra as a singer and dancer.

In the 1940's, Lena Horne became the first black woman to sign a long-term contract with a major film studio, leading to starring roles in such movies as CABIN IN THE SKY and STORMY WEATHER, which made her one of the top night club and theatre box office attractions in the country.  Under contract to MGM, she appeared in several films such as PANAMA HATTIE, AS THOUSANDS CHEER, SWING FEVER, BROADWAY RHYTHM, TWO GIRLS AND A SAILOR, ZIEGFELD FOLLIES and TILL THE CLOUDS ROLL BY.  During World War II, she was the pin-up queen for thousands of Black GI's and performed at army camps and on USO tours.

As an honorary member of the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, she has performed a series of fund-raising concerts to further its work.  She has also contributed significantly in other fund-raising activities for civil and human rights organizations such as the NAACP and B'NAI BRITH. She was a long-time supporter of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr's SCLC and was a peaceful warrior in the fight for justice and equality.

Ms. Horne married Lennie Hayton, her musical mentor at MGM, and evolved into the consummate performer who was a sensation and delighted audiences in popular clubs and on stages all over the world.  Ms. Horne is the mother of two children; Teddy Jones, a son who died in 1970, and a daughter Gail.

Her recent album THE MEN IN MY LIFE is her first recording since the release of THE LADY AND HER MUSIC.  Her stellar career achievements and tireless devotion to civic causes have earned her wide-spread respect and recognition from her peers and the public alike.

Thirty three years after he burst upon the scene as a gold-medal winner at the Rome Olympics, Muhammad Ali remains a 
magical figure, known and loved throughout the world.
Between 1964 and 1981, Muhammad Ali became one of the most celebrated and best-known persons in the world, showing us 
that all is possible with a belief in ""self."" He is quoted to have said; ... ""to be a great champion you must believe you are the best. If 
you're not, pretend you are.""
Ali brought unprecedented speed and grace to his sport, and his charm and wit changed forever what we expect a champion to be. 
His accomplishments in the ring were the stuff of legend -- two fights with Sonny Liston, where he proclaimed himself ""The Greatest"" 
and proved that he was; three epic wars with Joe Frazier; the stunning victory over George Foreman in Zaire; and dethroning Leon 
Spinks to become heavyweight champion for the unprecedented third time. But there was always far more to Muhammad Ali than what 
took place in the boxing ring.
Ali's life and career have been played out as much on the front page as on the sports page. His early embrace of the Nation of Islam 
and his insistence on being called Muhammad Ali instead of this ""slave name,"" Cassius Clay heralded a new era in black pride.
To stay out of the Vietnam War, in 1967 Ali declared himself a conscientious objector on religious grounds. This bold act caused 
him to be stripped of his world title, an action repudiated a few years later by the United States Supreme Court. 
During his career, Ali has lectured on college campuses, retired three times, brought hostages home from the Middle East and starred 
in a movie of his own life (The Greatest, 1977.)
Mr. Ali, a deeply religious man, evokes feelings of love and respect wherever he travels. No athlete has ever contributed more to 
the life of his country or the world than Muhammad Ali.
Muhammad Ali, the father of eight children, lives in Berrien Springs, Michigan with his wife Lonnie."

Some of the most enthusiastic quilters are young people.  Shown is the Horizon's 
Edge Peace Quilt made by 7th and 8th graders.  When last we heard, the school was searching 
for a sister/brother school in another country - please let us hear what happened to your quilt.

Patricia Halligan, an elementary teacher at Garlough School in West St. Paul, Minnesota, 
writes that she is a quilter interested in sharing her passion with students in her school.  The 
school's spring music concert in March of 1992 with Peace and Global Awareness.  Each student 
- nearly 500 of them - made a paper quilt square reflecting their artistic impressions of this theme 
to be used the blanket the back of the stage.  What a creative way not only to focus on peace but 
to give the students first-hand experience in cooperating to achieve an impressive result!

Local Peacequilting

""People-to-people peacemaking"" is the basic tenet of most of the peacemakers we 
know.  And once you're involved in that, whether globally or locally, it's hard to stop.  In 
November 1985, a group of Church Women United in New Jersey, members of the 
Parsippany-Danville Unit, made a friendship quilt and donated it to the Jersey Battered 
Women's Shelter.  (We were pleased that they utilized information from BPQP for that quilt.)  
Ever since then, Mount Tabor Methodist Church members in Parsippany from continued the 
tradition by contributing 20-some quilts a year to the Shelter, and each shelter resident is given 
one as she leaves to start a new home and with skills to build a new, more peaceful life.

Middle East Response

You may remember the Peaceful Pieces issue following the war with Iraq when much 
of that issue was given over to the event so much on our minds.  The conflict, unfortunately, 
continues, Grace Boyles, of Meadville, Missouri, reminds us of how many of us then felt:
""I cried a lot - both silently and aloud for many weeks in early 1991.  Was aghast at 
the ridiculous counterfeit 'victory celebrations.'  Victory over what?
""I read this in a book yesterday.  'Peacemaking is the cure of distrust and suspicion.'  I 
pray God's blessings on your continued efforts.  I also pray for our own country because we 
have so much distrust and suspicion among our citizens.""
Somewhat after the fact, we know, but a letter from Nina Mussellam, Powell River, 
B.C., in May of 1991 about the Middle East War underlines the fact that we quilters are a 
fortunate bunch - we can express our thoughts and feelings in fabric in a positive, creative way, 
and in the process work to bring a message of peace to others.  Nina writes:
""My anger, frustration and other 'gray' feelings dominated most of my days.  I don't 
know what I would have done without my quilting to bring me some peaceful moments.  
Quilting friends are a wonderful thing to have!... Another aspect of the war that affected me 
and my quilting - I found my feelings were really affecting my choice of patterns - lots of 
chopped up triangles and sharp points.  Chaos!  It was also affecting my colour choices.  I 
could only think in hot pinks, magentas, reds, blacks, grays, purples to intense blues - not safe 
tranquil colours, that's for sure!""

Rosa Parks

Detoit, Michigan 48206

Dear Mrs. Parks, 

This is just a note to let you know how work on your quilt is
progressing. We've completed a design, handed out squared to
various people in the community, and are beginning to receive the
completed squares back. In a few weeks it will be time to piece
the top, baste it to batting and back, and begin quilting. The
quilt should be finished by June when we're hoping that you'll
come out to Boise to accept it. 

Boise is nice in June; the weather's usually not too hot, and the
last of the spring flowers blend with the first of the summer ones. 
All the trees have leafed out, and the older parts of the town are
green and shady. It would be a good time of year for you to come. 

While you're here, would you like to talk to a community
group? On previous projects the Peace Quilters have worked with
the local university, with many churches, and with the state's
Human Rights Commission.   Contributors to your quilt include
members of Boise's N.A.A.C.P., the Black Student Union at Boise
State University, and two churches with predominately African-
American congregations. Between all those groups, I'm sure we can
arrange a location for you to speak, and a large and interested 
audience. 

Along related lines, I'm assuming that Elaine Steele would travel
with you. Can we provide accomodations for you the two of you in
someone's home?  It's a bit early to begin thinking about this kind
of detail, but if we knew that you could come in June, and had some
idea of what you'd prefer to do while you were here, we could
begin making plans, so that your visit would go as smoothly as
possible. 

Mainly though, I just wanted to say ""hello,"" and let you know that
your quilt looks like it's going to be very pretty. We're excited
as we watch the elements of the design come together, and we hope
you will be too when you see it. 
                                                                  Best wishes, 
                                                                  Kathy

We recently received a copy of a letter sent by the
Western North Carolina Quilters Guild in Hendersonville,
North Carolina, to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington,
expressing their outrage at the Smithsonian's licensing
of four 19th Century American quilts to American Pacific
Enterprises, who will import cheaply-made quilts from
China to sell as commemorative items of our American
quilting heritage:
""It doesn't take an American quilter to see the irony of this: The Smithsonian, a
virtual paragon of American historical tradition, getting into bed with predatory importers
hiring working in a foreign land to make a fast buck on what American women have worked
for over two centuries to achieve--a richness and excellence in a distinctly American craft.""
The letter not only decries the exploitation of Chinese women who work for just
pennies an hour in a country notorious for human rights abuses, but points out the existence in
the U.S. of quilting co-ops and businesses capable of generating such quilts, the thousands of
individual quilters who would be willing to do this kind of work at home, the low cost of the
imported quilts which makes fair competition difficult, if not impossible, and the country's
trade deficit.  The group resolved to ""show our objections by the following actions:
1. We won't buy the quilts.
2. We will publicize this issue as much as we can in an effort to keep others from
buying them.
3. We will promote the ""Buy American"" campaign whenever possible. . .""

The Ribbon Project
The Ribbon International, 235 East 22nd Street, #11J, New York, NY 10010, celebrates
the beauty and importance of life by displaying our growing global awareness while
affirming our diversity.  Ribbons are cloth panels made by people of all ages from around the
world illustrating what each loves most and wants to protect from environmental pollution and 
nuclear war.
Ribbons are used for Earth Day Celebrations around the world.  Ribbon exhibits are
encouraged to call attention to the goals and treaties of the UN Earth Summit.  Every year, 
United Nations Day (October 24th) will be commemorated with worldwide Ribbon events.
You can join with othersthrough a local school, church group, organization, senior
citizens' center, library, or scout group to participate in this thought-provoking, ongoing
international art project.

Idaho Quilters
Fabric art comes in many forms and uses a multitude of techniques.  But for sheer
beauty in the viewing and satisfaction in the doing, there is nothing like expert hand quilting.
Some women in Buhl, Idaho, are certainly among those who have probably forgotten
more about hand quilting than many of us ever learn.  Shown seated in the photo from left are
Elsie Hamilton, Eileen Duffy, Alpha Malone, Bonnie Head, Lilly Baker, Olive Casebeer,
Matilda Machacek and Bernice Meier, and standing are Merna Hatfield, left, and Amanda
Wilson.  Two other members, Myrtle Graesch and Alice Olson, were not available for the
picture.  These energetic women get together twice a week at the Buhl Senior Citizen Center
and since 1983 have quilted an incredible 269 quilt tops pieced by others.  The fees they earn
from those who send pieced tops for completion from all over the country are donated to the
senior citizen center in Buhl.
Besides helping others enjoy the beauty of new and old quilts, they volunteer quilting
time for such community projects as the BPQP Human Rights Centennial Quilt in 1990.
The group's Matilda Machacek reminds us what all of us quilters know about:
""Besides the love of quilting, the fellowship among the quilters is a strong tie.""
Awesome ladies!

Regular readers of ""Lady's Circle
Patchwork Quilts"" who travel vicariously
with Editorial Director Karen O'Dowd,
Contributing Editor Carter Houck, and
photographer Myron Miller on their quilt
trips across American may think they have
the best jobs in the world.
They do.  but it is also a lot of hard
work - rewarding work, if their trip to 
Idaho in July 1992 is typical.  The magazine
contacted Boise Peace Quilters, the
subject of an LCPQ article several years
ago, about a story on Idaho quilts and
quilters, and the trio traveled west.
The Peace Quilters contacted 
other groups around the state, including
the Boise Basin Quilters of Boise, and
quilts were brought to various locations for 
selection and photography.
Quilts were piled high one warm 
summer morning at Peace Quilter Pat
Hall's log cabin home in Boise.  One by
one, they were carefully examined in the 
living room by Karen, Carter and Myron,
and a few selected for photos.
""Each quilt is very important to 
them,"" BBQ member Mary Pallanch
Sanders said.  ""If they met you in the
future, they might not remember your
name, but they would remember your quilt.
They are highly professional, highly 
feeling.""
Sanders added: ""This is an 
important part of quilting, too.  They not
only see the quilts, but they meet and care
about the people who do the work.  They 
have time to be concerned about you as a

person.  What they do personally for quilts and
quilters makes us all more professional.""
While Carter and Karen took copious
notes, made lists, and asked for information on
the Log Cabins, Cats, and Trips Around the
World, Myron carefully chose interior locations
for photos, a log wall, an antique bed, a dresser, a
railing.  No detail is too small when photographing
quilts, from making sure the pieces are 
straight to measuring light in a room.  He takes
black and white test shots first, then color, and using 
a large 120 format.
Sanders photographed various locations
in Boise for potential outdoor shoots.  The LCPQ
team chose the Idaho Historical Museum, the
Julia Davis Park Rose Garden, and other private
homes.
An antique blue and white ""Star and
Crescent"" quilt was photographed in a turn of the
century kitchen display in the Museum, a geometric
""Rose Garden Path"" graced a park bench
in the Rose Garde, and a Japanese-inspired silk
wall hanging was recorded on film in a North
End home with stained-glass windows.
How do they choose which quilts to
feature?  Through a quick but careful process of
elimination, they select what they determine will 
photograph well and please their readers, then
marry a quilt to a location, giving each one star
treatment.  A form is filled out by the owner
containing information about when the quilt was
made and special stories behind it.  About 40
Idaho quilts were photographed on location.

with the magazine since its inceptions in the 1970's, communicates with Karen and Carter
throughout the shoot, and they know when it is is right.
""I think they work together well,"" Sanders commented.  ""They are tuned in to one
another's needs.  They can also forget the pressures of the moment, and seek you out for
details about your quilt.""
Peace Quilter Jolene Graham recalled, ""We were impressed by how hard they would
work all day and then go back to the hotel and work some more.  With telephones and FAXes, 
they edit future issues of the magazine at night.""  She added, ""Perhaps the most important
thing Karen, Carter and Myron did for us was build a bridge between the Boise Peace Quilters
and the Boise Basin Quilters.""
The two groups make quilts for different reasons: BPQP uses quilting to advance the
cause of peace, and the BBQ promotes the art, craft, tradition and history.   ""Through this
process, we now know each other by our first names.  I think we will now work together
more.""
After a week in Boise and Sun Valley, Karen O'Dowd, Carter Houck and Myron
Miller completed their research on Idaho quilts, but they didn't head home.  The trio was off
to Montana and Big Sky Country to bring more quilts of the West to the readers of Lady's
Circle Patchwork Quilts.

The Earthsteward peace quilt made its first journey overseas with the 1992 spring Mid-East delegations.  It was displayed for two days in the Ramallah Friends School in the West Bank.  Palestinian high school students were free to come take messages of peace and friendship from the quilt pockets.  Some students left their own messages, like the following:

""I was very touched when I read your notes.  Sometimes it feels good to know that other people understand or at least sympathize with us.  Being a Palestinian teenager is not always easy.  Sometimes feelings of hopelessness and pessimism dominate you.  But when you hear about people all around the world who care, it makes you feel that much better.  I hope, as many others do, that Palestine will finally become independent and peace will come to this region.  Thank you for your concern and I hope you'll continue to pay special attention to events in my land.""

We told you in our last issue about the quilt we were crafting for Danaan Parry of
Earthstewards' Network who came to Boise for the presentation in April of 1992.  The quilt
was gorgeous, if we do say so ourselves.  A lot of people in the community participated - we
again thank all of them for their squares and the thoughtful messages sent to explain them.
Typical are these reflections from Ruth Barnes Kunze of Idaho Falls, Idaho, who made an
intricate patched pocket:
""My thinking centered on the idea that in diplomacy and negotiations every tiny
word and thought and action may have significant meaning beyond its initial
intent.  The many, many patches in my pocket represent such tiny thoughts and
words.  Every one is important to the whole.  Patches, like people, have a grain,
a bias, and a strength.  Each one working or pulling in a separate direction.  Yet
while together they manage to prosper and product a meaningful whole, each
one still retains separateness and identity.""   Thank you, Ruth.

We were also delighted to hear from Danaan, whose appearance in Boise to pick up
the quilt and his motivating words to those gathered for the ceremony renewed our own 
commitment to building bridges.  As we hoped at the outset, the quilt has already traveled
extensively with this remarkable human being.

Peace by Piece

We have long felt that a book about our quilts would be 
an ideal way to formally document the Project's peacequilting
work.  For the past year we have been working with Floating
Ink Press in Boise who are in the process of completing the 
book Peace by Piece.  Sam Silva, through research and interviews
with Quilters, has illuminated with a sure touch the 
reasons and purposes of BPQP to accompany the wonderful
full color photographs of all of our quilts.  We look forward to
seeing the book off the presses in early 1993.

Bike Aid

Is it possible to see the country while 
working for social justice and global harmony?
The 15 cyclists who visited Boise this summer
on a Bike Aid cross-country trek say YES!
This energetic band was an eclectic bunch.
Ages ranged from 17 to 42; some were expert
cyclists in top physical shape, others were 
brand new at touring.  But they all raised
$3,000 apiece to contribute to the community
service projects of the Overseas Development
Network.  In the past six years Bike Aid has
raised over $800,000 to support the O.D.N.'s
domestic and international grassroots development
initiatives--from potable water systems in 
Central America to educational training
projects on Native American reservations in
this country.
This year over 60 vigorous activists
pedalled their way toward Washington D.C. on
five different convergent routes.  ""Our"" group
originated in Portland and included members
from Kansas, Georgia, Delaware, California
and all points in between.  As they travelled
from community to community they had an up-close
experience in our land and its people that 
few enjoy.  Hosts all along the way introduced 
cyclists to their communities and their unique
resources and problems.  While they were
here, we took them into our homes, fed them,
helped them work on the bikes, got to know 
about their lives and experiences.  Our Tuesday
night quilting bee just after their departure
was filled with the laughter and energy they
had left us.
This year's trek was focused on an
awareness of Native Americans.  On their
Boise stop, Bike-Aiders joined with Peace

Quilters to help the Painted Horse War
Dance Society prepare grounds for its annual
international pow wow; in return these Native
Americans danced in full regalia at our
celebration pottluck in the park.  We were all 
invited to join in some of the dances and we
must have been better than we thought, for
the rain began to pour!
We've heard from these cyclists as
they've traveled all across the country this 
summer, and they sent us an exuberant card 
when they reached Washington D.C. Thanks
to their visit we are linked to many more 
communities across the U.S.  Neil Jeffery, an
English workcamper who attended our very
first international Volunteers For Peace
workcamp in 1986, urged us to consider 
getting involved with Bike Aid.  Networking 
with these young and dynamic idealists makes
it seem that the whole world is our neighborhood!
If you're interested in riding on next
year's Bike Aid trek, or being a host community,

Network at 333 Valencia St., Suite 330, San

   Sister cities relate to each other in many ways - and joining hands literally as well as
figuratively over a lovingly planned quilt is an especially wonderful way to cross cultural and
distance barriers.
   Sister cities Buffalo, New York, and Kalinin, Russia, through the enthusiastic work of
the Southtowns Piecemakers Quilting Guild of East Aurora, New York (near Buffalo),
cooperated on a quilt which was presented to the Russian city during the summer of 1990.
Over 100 members of the Guild made and signed their red, white and blue squares; the center
motif features the Bear's Paw Patterns, not only the symbol of the Guild but the Russian
symbol as well. Messages were cross stitched in English and Russian. The quilt top then
traveled to a Buffalo-Kalinin Sister City meeting to have the members add their signatures to
the border. Then, as the quilt inscription states, ""Many hands quilt with thought of Peace.""
   The BPQP, too, has recently been involved in Sister Cities connections: Quilters Pat
Hall and husband Dale continued their life-long people-to-people peacemaking work with a trip
to Chita, Siberia, this summer - Dale's report illustrates once again the affinities that such a 
program inspires:

Chita - Sister City to Boise
by Dale Hall

   Chita, Siberia? Not many have heard of it, let alone gone there. We went., A group
of seven Boiseans traveled to Chita in August, 1992, and what an experience it was.
   In the 1950's President Dwight Eisenhower suggested that international citizen-to-citizen
relations were the very best way to bring peace to the world, and the Sister Cities
program was developed.
   In the mid-1980's, the Boise Physicians and Health Professionals for Social Responsibility
started the Boise Sister City Committee. For months there were discussions of which
city to relate to. Then, in 1988, four Soviet women touring the U.S. stopped in Boise for a
conference. One of them, Ludmilla, noted that Boise was very much like her home, Chita. A
Sister City member heard the comment and the die was cast. We would try to establish
relations with Chita.
   More months went by. Correspondence crossed the ocean. Plans were made. Who
was to go? When? What was the agenda?
   In April 1992 another Chita resident came to Boise. She was a young woman,
Victoria Ivanova, student of English at the University of Nevada. ""Vica"" as she is called, told
us more about Chita and really captured our hearts. She returned home to Chita in May, 1992, 
with a promise to help.
   On Friday, August 14, the Boise Seven arrived in Chita. In the morning we all met in
the Mayor's office where the Siberians produced a Sister City agreement which was then
signed.

   Jump now, to Boise in September. A telex is received. Six Russians want to come to
Boise. A return telex invites the six - Chita's mayor, the Deputy Mayor, the head of the City
Council, and three businessmen - to Boise. Only a few weeks later, on November 29, the six
arrive.
   After wight activity-packed days, the group returned to Chita, carrying with them a
quilted banner from the Boise Peace Quilters to remind them of the friendships forged in
Chita and in Boise. The Sister City Committee regaled them with an amazing variety of
activities. During their busy itinerary, they met with the Mayor and Boise City Council, went
to college (Boise States University), watched Indian dancers and Idaho Cloggers, learned about
eating food fish, ate pizza, visited the Legislature, attended the Snake River Alliance Peace
Fair, and went folk dancing. We were delighted to be able to reciprocate the wonderful Chita
hospitality and look forward to an enduring Sister City relationship.
   More and more citizen-to-citizen connections! Peace.

Rosa Parks Quilt
   January 18, 1993, our Rosa Parks Quilt provided a soothing, expressive backdrop to
the Martin Luther King, Jr./Idaho Human Rights Day even in the Rotunda of the Idaho
Statehouse.
   The quilt features a portrait of Mrs. Parks that is surrounded by images and words
from the Civil Rights Movement that she sparked. Governor Cecil D. Andrus and Attorney
General Larry EchoHawk, the nation's first Native American elected to state office, issued
strong warnings to those who want to limit the rights of gays. (A few days earlier the leader of
the fight in Oregon for Measure 9 had announced the formation of the Idaho Citizens Alliance
and pledged to get a similar initiative on the Idaho ballot in 1994).
   We have enjoyed showing the Rosa Parks Quilt to school children and other interested
groups whil arranging for the quilt's presentation to Mrs. Parks. She will be coming to
Boise April 15. Helping us coordinate her visit are St. Paul's Baptist Church and Boise State
University. How we are looking forward to her visit!

Quilters Linda Skoro, Carolyn Good, Pat Hall, Kathy Hodges (back to camera), and Joleen Graham

Mr. Rogers, host of Public Television's longest-running, visited Boise Oct.
27-29 to receive his Peace Quilt Award. Fred Rogers, recipient of innumerable honorary
doctorate degrees, was genuinely moved by his quilt. The presentation took place at the
KAID studio and was shown lie on local affiliates.
His portrait at the top of the quilt, stitched by Jinny DeFoggi, is uncannily lifelike,
even to Mr. Rogers' soft cardigan sweater. His sneakers are near by.

Fred Rogers, Mr. McFeely, Jeanette Gorman, and Elizabeth Jay listen as Jinny DeFoggi presents Mister Rogers his
Peace Quilt Award.

Fred Rogers lives in Pittsburgh, where Mister Rogers' Neighborhood is produced.
When Jinny originally called his production company,k she talked with Lisa Belcher Hamilton,
a producer of the program. Jeanette Gorman says ""She was enthusiastic about the quilt and
became a BPQP supporter from the very beginning. Lisa watched the film ""A Stitch for
Time"" before giving it to Mister Rogers to view. She said she loved the message of our
quilts."" Eventually, through many conversations with Lisa, we learned that Lisa's husband 
Scott was diagnosed with lung cancer, and that it had spread to his bones. We sent Lisa, Scott,

4

and Teddy, their two-year-old son, our Anniversary Quilt. Lisa called right after opening the
package to say how beautiful it was--and that it was already on their bed. ""Lisa quit her job to
spend full time with Scott,"" Jeanette continues. He died within months. Lisa is attending
divinity school now, but she still corresponds with the BPQP."" In fact, she sent a box of Scott's
favorite clothes to Jinny and asked her to make his ties, caps,. and shirts into a quilt. Jinny,
whose work with fabric is imaginative, fresh, and SKILLED, is creating a quilted collage of
Scott's clothing, one that Lisa and Teddy will cherish.
Jeanette presented David Newell, alias Mr. McFeeley, a quilted wall hanging of the
cap his character wears. David was grateful, in major part because his wife quilts. David had
taken over the responsibilities for scheduling Mr. Rogers' appointments from Lisa, including
many conversations with Jeanette and Heidi.
Five-year-old Ben Blake and his sister Jenny were among the quilters who greeted,
then bid farewell to, Mister Rogers and David Newell at the Boise Airport. Mr. Rogers held
Ben's hand during his walk through the airport's corridors. Ben cried when Mr. Rogers and
David Newell waved goodbye, asking ""Mom, will we ever see them again?"" Jenny said ""Before
we met (them) we were fans, but now we are friends.""

The Mister Rogers Quilt also made connections with another valiant human being with health
problems...

Cody
by Jeanette Gorman

One of my walking partners, Jan Schlicht, is a pediatric nurse at Saint Luke's Hospital.
When I told her Mister Rogers was going to receive a Peace Quilt Award, and that
squares would be designed by little fans of his show, she told me about a little boy, Cody
Briggs, who had virtually grown up in the pediatrics ward of the hospital. He had congenital
difficulties and was subsequently diagnosed as having childhood leukemia. His world was
largely confined to a small hospital room, and he had grown to love Mister Rogers, never
missing his show. He was three years old when Jan asked him to draw a picture for the quilt.
He drew three or four lovely crayon pictures which were then given to Audrey Hatfield, an
artist and quilter, to render into a square. When the quilt was completed, a group of quilters
took it to the hospital, and Cody identified all the characters from Mister Rogers Neighborhood
that were appliqued around the border. The Make a Wish Foundation had offered to
pay Cody's way to Pittsburgh to meet Fred. The arrangements were all made, and Cody was
set to go. His condition worsened, however, and his doctors agreed that Cody could no longer
make the trip. Cody died not long after his disappointment in not being able to see Mister
Rogers in person. But his family displayed the Misters Rogers Quilt at Cody's funeral. Cody
held a little red trolley, like those embroidered on the quilt.

by Lyn McCullum
Les Brown received a$250,000 MacArthur Foundation ""Genius Award.""  He also won
the United Nation's 1989 environment prize.  We're enthused about making him--and the
Worldwatch Institute--a Boise Peace Quilt Award.
His annual State of the World Report may be studied more intently by more people in
more countries than any other assessment.  The 1992 edition appears in 27 languages and has
been adopted by 1,379 professors in 633 college and universities in the U.S. alone.
Worldwatch's newest book, Vital Signs:  The Trends That Are Shaping Our Future, provides
an accurate and provocative picture of the globe, i.e.:
-Seven of the eight warmest years on record have occurred in the last decade.
-Solar-generated electricity jumped dramatically.
-World population is growing by 92 million per year, or 10,522 per hour, breaking all
records.
-There is a 46% decrease in ozone-depleting CFC's.
-Growth in grain harvest is losing momentum.  More people are hungry.
Eighty percent of theworld's 9,000 bird species are in decline; many face extinction.
-World bicycle production now outpaces automobiles by three to one.
-World poultry consumption is overtaking beef.
-Nuclear generating capactiy fell for the first time in 1991.
-Natural gas production reached a new high in 1991.
Les Brown predicted in 1986 that if the U.S. and Soviet Union didn't stop the arms
race, they would 1) blow the world up or 2) simply sink below the Rising Sun (Japan) from the
burden of their arsenals.  From 1961-1986, the annual global outlay for arms rose from $400
billion to $940 billion, exceeding the entire income of the poorer half of humanity.  His
prophecy became fact.
The Worldwatch Quilt will be spectacular!  Sarah Harris, one of our quilt maestros,
fine-tuned our design for the central panel and helped us select the muted vibrant solids for the
mosaic of blocks that will surround the panel.  No one could interpret the children of many
lands with more expression or skill than Sarah.  What a compelling image!  The mosaic blocks
surrounding the center panel will suggest some of the ways to create a sustainable future, like
bicycling, organic gardening, renewable energy and family planning.  We will begin quilting it
this month.  Les Brown will come to Boise to receive his compelling quilt, perhaps this Spring.

QUILT SHOW
by Jeanette Gorman
The Boise Peace Quilt Project was asked to participate in the Pacific International
Quilt Festival this fall.  We recalled 19 of our 28 quilts for display at that event.  They joined
over 500 quilts from around the world.  One of the quilts that drew the most attention was the
quilt for Mister Rogers.  As Jinny DeFoggi said in her presentation speech, ""No one passed by
the quilt without stopping.""  Those who stopped, smiled in recognition and appreciation.
Many people became misty-eyed as they remembered their association with this peacemaker
who spends so much time with America's children.  Those who stopped to see the quilt also
reached out to touch it, many of them pointing to the characters on the border who frequent
the Land of Make Believe.  Over 6,000 people attended the show and saw the quilt.  I don't 
believe there was one person who didn't immediately recognize Fred Rogers' portrait at the
top.  They recognized him not as a peace quilt recipient but as a friend.

Then, the quilt on the frame.

We started quilting in early summer of '91 and completed the
quilt in March of '92.  To make a quilt takes a least a
thousand hours.

While awaiting your award presentation, we proudly displayed
your quilt at schools, churches and quilt shows.  On Martin
Luther King Day, 1993, your quilt hung in the Idaho Capitol
Rotunda as backdrop for the holiday program.

All through this time messages were being phoned across the
country:  Would Rosa Parks like a quilt?  What are her
favorite colors?   Then;  When can she come to Boise to
receive it?  Elaine Steele was our contact.  She heard from
us quite regularly.

Now, you receive your Boise Peace Quilt Award and with it
this scrapbook, compiled by Chris Fuhrman.  It contains
pictures and messages from people who have helped in the
making.

We wish you comfort and joy from our efforts.  We look upon
you as a heroine who was willing to take great risks to
further the cause of justice and equality in our nation.  You
are a fine example to all Americans and to the world.  Thank 
you, Rosa Parks.

 Patricia K. Hall

We love you,

times to Washington DC to express our concerns for peace.
Our National Peace Quilt, which 67 Senators claimed to have
slept under, has been accepted by the Smithsonian.

So, here we are, twelve years later, having made our 28th
quilt.

The story of your quilt began on May 18th, 1991.  The Boise
Peace Quilt Project met at my house for a decision making
meeting, that morning.  We come together at these meetings to
decide what our next quilt project will be.  At the meeting,
the group was presented with suggestions by various members
and friends.  A gentle man named John Farrell presented your
name, Rosa Parks.  Through the process of consensus, with
consideration for all the proposals, the members then decided
to honor you.

With that decision, a committee was formed and the
preparation for quilt making began.  We decided to learn more
about African-American quilt design and more about you.  We
headed for our local libraries and even sent to Portland for 
special research books to help us.

We had weekly meetings for six weeks, discussing and sharing 
information.  Designs were proposed and modified.  In our
zeal, we tried to incorporate into one quilt all we had 
learned.  This made for a very complex quilt.  We wanted to
tell some of the stories of the Civil Rights Movement, the
history of African-Americans, and your story.  We also wanted
to use what we learned about the craft of African-
American quilt making.

We started from the center and worked out.  We used the
""checkerboard"" blocks for story blocks.  We included ""nine
patch"", ""log cabin"", ""string"", ""strip"" and other traditional 
block designs.  We used the fabric photo process, embroidered
messages and appliqued symbols.  The roses in the corners
stand for your name.  The back of the quilt is a ""strip""
design made with rose print fabrics.

We learned the block design called ""flying geese"" is an
ancient universal African symbol meaning ""journey"".  This
symbol ""journeys"" around your quilt to honor the many who
walked in the Montgomery protest.

The African-American community expressed interest in our
undertaking and offered to help.  Members of St. Pauls
Baptist Church, Miracle Temple and the local NAACP joined us.

We distributed the block and strip assignments.  Each came
back created with special meaning by the person who made it.
Our committee sewed the blocks and strips together.  Next, we
joined the batting and the strip backing (made by Jinny

April 15, 1993

Rosa Parks, on behalf of the Boise Peace Quilt Project, Ryan 
Liebenthal and I want to welcome you, your executive
secratary, Elaine Steele, and all the people who have come to
honor you this evening.  We come together to present you with
a peace quilt award and music.  Ryan's and my part has to do 
with the award.

When Ryan heard the Quilt Project had selected you to receive
a quilt, she asked to be part of the quilt making process. 
Ryan will tell you why you are important to her.
............................. 

Thank you, Ryan.

Now, I will tell about our project and especially about your
quilt.

The Boise Peace Quilt Project began in 1981, when two mothers
were discussing the concerns they had for the future of their
children.

At that time Ronald Reagan was the new President.  The cold
war was being fought.  Nuclear weapons proliferation and 
testing worried many of us.

These two mothers wondered what they could do to encourage
peace, understanding and cooperation between the two super-
powers, the U.S. and the U.S.S.R.  They had the creative idea
of asking similarly concerned friends to help them make a 
friendship quilt, a comforting, symbolic gift that could be
universally understood.  The quilt, with its message, would
then go to the Soviet Union for the ordinary people of that
country as a gift from ordinary people in the United States.

That is what happened and the project started.  The quilt was
so well received that some of those who were involved wanted
to carry on the idea.  They not only decided to make quilts 
to send messages to other countries, but to give as awards to
individual people and groups.  People who stand for the great
democratic and peaceful values we believe are so important to
human freedom, dignity and understanding.

Our local YWCA generously donated space for our quilting
frame and meetings.

Some of our quilts were awarded to such peacemakers as Norman
Cousins, Pete Seegar, Dr. Helen Caldecott and others.  Mister
Rogers and the friends in his ""neighborhood"" recently
received one.  Quilts have gone not only to the Soviet Union, 
Hiroshima, England, Nicaragua, and to the peace negotiators

Therefore,
she continued to take care of their home and care for her mother while her brother
Sylvester worked outside of the home.  Rosa received her high school diploma in 1934,
after her marriage to Raymond Parks, December 18, 1932.
Raymond, now deceased, born in Wedowee, Alabama, February 12, 1903, received
little formal education due to racial segregation.  He was a self educated person with
the assistance of his mother, Geri Parks.  His immaculate dress and his thorough
knowledge of domestic affairs and current events made most think he was college
educated.  He supported and encouraged Rosa's desire to complete her formal
education.
Mr. Parks was an early activist in the effort to free the ""Scottsboro Boys,"" a celebrated
case in the 1930's.  Together, Raymond and Rosa worked in the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP's) programs.  He was an active
member and she served as secretary and later youth leader of the local branch.  At the
time of her arrest, she was preparing for a major youth conference.
After the arrest of Rosa Parks, black people of Montgomery and sympathizers of other
races organized and promoted a boycott of the city bus line that lasted 381 days.  Dr.
Martin Luther King, Jr. was appointed the spokesman for the Bus Boycott and taught
non-violence to all participants.  Contingent with the protest in Montgomery, others
took shape throughout the south and the country.  They took form as sit-ins, eat-ins,
swim-ins and similar causes.  Thousands of courageous people joined the ""protest"" to
demand equal rights for all people.
Since 1965, Mrs. Parks has been employed by Congressman John Conyers, First
Congressional District of Michigan.  In February, 1987 she began the Rosa and
Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development.  The purpose is to motivate and direct 
the ""average"" youth not targeted by other programs to achieve their highest potential.
Rosa Parks sees the energy of young people as a real force for change.  It is among her
most treasured themes pf human priorities as she speaks to young people of all ages at
schools, colleges and national organizations around the country.
Mrs. Parks has received ten honorary doctorate degrees, hundred of plaques,
certificates, citations, awards and keys to several cities.  Among them are the NAACP's
Spingarn Medal, the UAW's Social Justice Award, the Martin Luther King, Jr. Non-violent
Peace Prize and most recently in May of 1987, the Roger Joseph Prize with a
cash award of then thousand dollars, from the Hebrew Union College.
A quiet exemplification of courage, dignity and determination; Rosa Parks is a symbol
to all Americans to remain free."

Ours could be described as the most problematic 
time in human history. Nuclear war threatens to 
annihilate all life on earth.  Our preparations for 
war, our greed and the thoughtless way we are
treating our environment are dangerous and 
frightening.   As the tide of awareness and concern 
for potential disaster rises in people like 
ourselves, we become aware that we and must act.
The idea for the Peace Quilt arose from two 
strands of thought: How can we make friends 
with some ordinary Russian people?   And 
secondly, Wouldn't it be fun to quilt together? We 
turned out thoughts into a concrete step towards 
understanding and friendship with people of the
Soviet Union. We chose the ""friendship quilt,"" a 
traditional cooperative American art form, 
because it's promise is the fruit of friendship--
both between the quilters themselves and through
its presentation, between American citizens and
citizens of other countries. For many of us, the 
quilts represent a ray of hope, a positive focus for 
our energy in a dark time.

The People
The Boise Peace Quilt Project has brought
together a diverse cross-section of individuals. 
Grandmothers, children and all ages in between 
have contributed to the quilts. Our roles and 
occupations are varied and our common desire for
peace binds us together. 

Our social, political and spiritual affiliations 
also vary greatly. Perhaps out strongest link is 
our overwhelming sense of conviction that 
people like us need to act, to make concrete 
statements that promote world peace. Our 
numbers have expanded from 35 to hundreds who 
have, in some way been involved in the local 
Peace Quilt Project.

The Work
In early December, 1981, three of us began by 
passing to friends and acquaintances a letter 
describing the envisioned Soviet friendship quilt. 
Soon 35 people were gathered with common
purpose and we felt an electric excitement as 
novices and experienced seamstresses alike 
completed this quilt.  Four of us personally 
presented this quilt at the Russian Embassy in 

Washington, D.C.  and it ultimately has made its 
home in Alitus, Lithuania. Its message of 
goodwill has been understood by the Soviet 
Women's Committee and the thousands of Soviet 
citizens who have seen  it.

The Ongoing Effort
The first quilt opened our eyes to the limitless 
possibilities for combining peacemaking and 
quiltmaking.  We determined to explore them all, 
and to encourage others to join us in the process. 
We make friendship quilts for people in other 
parts of the world; often transforming ""enemies"" 
into friends we haven't met yet.  We make Peace 
Quilt Awards for peacemakers who are blazing 
new trails to survival for our global family. Some 
are doctors, teachers, gardeners, statesmen, all are 
inspirational.    We make quilts which are
political statements and quilts which are
experiments in cooperative action. We have just 
begun to scratch the surface of what is possible."

denominator--they open the door to 
communication with people of all ages; they are 
disarming and heartwarming.  Quilts 
communicate across culture and language barriers 
speak their peace in a powerful way.
   Color greetings, postcards and posters of 
these quilts help to magnify their message and 
support our work.  We connect socially conscious 
fiber artists around the globe, there are many, 
with our biannual newsletter, Peaceful Pieces.
We welcome nominations for Peace Quilt Award
recipients from all quarters.

The Results
   What, we are asked, will be the results of our 
quilt project?  How many hearts and minds will it 
actually change?
   We have no illusion that this one small effort, 
like any other single action, will make the 
difference between war and peace.  But small 
efforts accumulate, like blades of grass to make a
meadow, like drops of rain to make a sea.
   More to the point, however, is our sense that 
the value of peacemaking efforts like this one is 
in the doing.  All of us who have tried 
peacequilting have experienced a personal 
transformation.  We are no longer sitting idly by.
We are reaching out from the quilting frame, in 
friendship, creating a peaceful world one stitch at 
a time.

""We'll stitch this world 
together yet!  Don't give up.""
Pete Seeger

What can ordinary people who are 
concerned--even frightened--about the 
prospect of nuclear holocaust do to help
avert the ultimate disaster?  We are a 
group of people in Boise, Idaho, 
who decided to wage peace from a

We have the following inspiring letter from West Germany's Irene Kahmann regarding 
the quilting connection which began before unification between Irene's textile group and a 
similar guild in Sachsen, East Germany:

""In January 1990 a woman's magazine called and asked if they can pass my address to a East-German 
lady, who was asking for contacts with a West-German 'textile group.' Already in 
February I received a letter from that lady telling me that she also was a member of a East-German 
textile group so called 'Circle for Folk Art in Textiles.' Our 3rd Exhibit 1991 in mind 
I ask her if this circle would be interested to make a group quilt together with us for our show.  
And they accepted.  My ideas were to use plain, white, old cloth, linen, sheets, cotton towels, 
etc., which they should still have. Using the same colors of dyes in both groups we choose 
blue, yellow with green; I suggested a interweaving design.  We dyed our material first, then I 
sent small samples of the dyed material with the same dyes and a finished sample 
block. 

""In July 1990 we met the first time.  We had invited them for a weekend. Ten women arrived 
and we hosted them in our homes and families.  One day long we assembled all our blocks, 
sewed lattice stripes and the small connection squares by hand and machine.  By this way we 
showed them hand- and machine- piecing .  It was a wonderful meeting, warm-heated and full 
with friendship when they left with our promises to revisit them in their home in autumn. 

""Two days after the reunification, October 3, 1990, ten women and two husbands went to 
Thalheim, Sachsen, with our half quilted piece.  We presented them a hoop, some quilt 
magazines and patchwork quilting accessories to start with patchwork and quilting and I taught 
them the main ideas in a few hours.  Again we spent some very happy days with them and 
friendships between the women became tighter.  In the meantime, many letters between the 
group members went back and forth.  I involved them more in our Show with models they had 
made for the fashion show.  We have invited them all to our Show and take charge for their 
staying and expenses.  They are happily looking forward to the event.  I am glad to say that 
since we became acquainted they got new impulses, ideas, goals and they perceived solidarity 
and relationship which is really necessary and helpful for them today.""

Images of the Earth
Twenty quilters from Oakridge and Westfir, Oregon, may be from tiny towns but their 
positive vision of ""what the Earth looks like where it hasn't been completely messed up, and 
what it can look like again after a short period of recovery"" has had global impact!  Their three 
large fabric tapestries, designed by Westfir fabric artist Philura Hassett, were delivered 
personally by Hassett to the U.N. Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June, 1992.  Named Gaia 
I, II, and III after the Greek goddess of the Earth, the hangings illustrate the Earth itself, with 
its forests, a mountain range and a lake. 
Greg Slotta, administrative officer of the U.S. Consulate in Rio, while visiting his 
mother, the Rev. Karen Slotta, in Oakridge, was so impressed by her church's quilt group work 
that he asked if the women could create three wall hangings for the consulate. They demurred 
but passed along the request to the towns' quilting group, the Piecemakers, and Hasset said 
yes. 
The Oregon women spent more than 900 hours piecing together 2 inch wide strips of 
fabric, each 42 to 60 inches long, in more than 300 hues.  Earth's breath, the air, is represented 
by the many colors of a sunrise, with flowers at the bottom and treetops in an upper corner, 
while its circulatory system, the waterways of the plant, is shown in sand, blues and greens.  
""The heartbeat is the tides,"" says the designer, who while in Brazil was awarded the national 
Brazilian Association of Design's Gold Medal for creative art. 
Wish we could show in color Gaia I, with the designer, and the wonderful colors of 
these breathtaking pieced tapestries.

Lift every voice and sing,
Till earth and heaven ring,
Ring with the harmonies of Liberty;
Let our rejoicing rise
High as the listening skies,
Let it resound loud as the rolling sea,
Sing a song full of the hope that the dark past has taught us;
Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us;
Facing the rising sun, of our new day begun,
Let us march on, till victory is won.

Stony the road we trod,
Bitter the chast'ning rod,
Felt in the days when hope unborn had died;
Yet with a steady beat,
Have not our weary feet,
Come to the place for which our fathers sighed?
We have come over a way that with tears has been watered,
We have come treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered,
Out from the gloomy past;
Till now we stand at last
Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast.

God of our weary years,
God of our silent tears
Thou who has brought us thus far on the way;
Thou who has by thy might
Led us into the light
Keep us forever in the path, we pray,
Lest our feet stray from the places, our God where we met thee,
Lest our hearts, drunk with the wine of the world, we forget thee;
Shadowed beneath thy hand
May we forever stand,
True to our God,
True to our native land.


We Shall Overcome

We shall overcome, We shall overcome,
We shall overcome some day.
Oh, deep in my heart I do believe
We shall overcome some day.

We'll walk hand in hand, we'll walk hand in hand,
We'll walk hand in hand some day,
Oh, deep in my heart I do believe
We shall overcome some day.

The truth will make us free, the truth will make us free,
The truth will make us free some day.
Oh, deep in my heart I do believe
We shall overcome some day."

THE SPINGARN MEDAL was instituted in 1914 by the late J. E. Spingarn
(then Chairman of the Board of Directors of the National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People), who gave annually, until his death in 1939,
a gold medal to be awarded for the highest or noblest achievement by an
American Negro during the preceding year or years. A fund sufficient to continue the award was set up by his will ""to perpetuate the lifelong interest of
my brother, Arthur B. Spingarn, of my wife, Amy E. Spingarn, and of myself
in the achievements of the American Negro.""

PURPOSE
The purpose of the medal is twofold---first to call the attention of the
American people to the existence of distinguished merit and achievement, among American Negroes, and secondly, to serve as a reward for such achievement,
and as a stimulus to the ambition of colored youth.

CONDITIONS
The medal is presented annually to the man or woman of African descent
and American citizenship, who shall have made the highest achievement during
the preceding year or years in any honorable field of human endeavor. The
Committee of Award is bound by no burdensome restrictions, but may decide
for itself each year what particular act or achievement deserves the highest
acclaim; the choice is not limited to any one field, whether of intellectual,
spiritual, physical, scientific, artistic, commercial, educational, or other endeavor.
It is intended primarily that the medal shall be for the highest achievement in
the preceding year, but if no achievement in any one year seems to merit it,
the Committee may award it for work achieved in preceding years, or may
withhold it. The medal is usually presented to the winner at the annual convention 
of the National Association for the Advanced of Colored People,
and the presentation speech is delivered by a distinguished citizen.

A nine-person Committee of Award is selected by the NAACP Board
of Directors. The Committee's decision is final in all matters affecting
the award. 

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE AWARD
should be submitted in writing to the Secretary of the Committee of Award,
1790 Broadway, New York City, by January 1 of each year. Such communications
should state in detail the achievements of the person recommended."

ROSA L. PARKS
Sixty-fourth Spingarn Medalist

In tribute to the quiet courage and determination
exemplified on December 1, 1955, when she refused
to surrender her seat on a Montgomery, Alabama, bus
to a white male passenger.  That act inspired a total, year-
long boycott of public transportation by the black citizens
of that city.  Her defiance of a demeaning tradition
brought about desegregation of buses in Montgomery
and set the stage for the great Civil Rights Movement
of the Sixties;

In recognition of her personal dedication since that time,
to the cause of civil rights and particularly, to the youth
of the Detroit area.  As a community activist, she has
offered job guidance, cultural and recreational planning
and inspiration to the young people of that city to whom
she is dedicated to help ""grow, develop, and reach their 
full potential,""

City of Detroit and its youth as exemplified by an upcoming program
spearheaded by such local leaders as Rev. James Holley, Councilwoman
Erma Henderson, Commissioners Currie and Simmons, and other civic
and church leaders.
This program provides for the following:  ""SELMA"" will open on
October 20, 1976 at the New Showcase Theatre located at 8041 Harper
at Van Dyke for a four week's run.  Proceeds from opening night will
be donated to the Martin Luther King Center for Social Change.  On
every Saturday night during the ""SELMA"" performance, a presentation
will be made on stage to be used toward a scholarship fund.  In addition, 
local talent will be provided an opportunity to appear on stage
at the Saturday and Sunday matinees.  The program will also provide
several job openings for youth to work as ushers, pop corn sellers,
etc.--This is a positive way to combat youthful unrest.
Mr. Joe Neaderlander is currently setting up a tour of ""SELMA""
to be shown at the Neaderlander Theatres in various cities throughout
the country, and Mr. Butler expresses a desire to dedicate another
performance of the musical to Mrs. Parks.
We are honored to have Mr. Butler as a platform guest this evening; 
and if you haven't seen ""SELMA"", now is your opportunity to see
a truly great musical.

PARKS - HEROINE, A NATIONAL LEGEND

Mrs. Parks' refusal to surrender her seat on a Montgomery, Alabama bus to a white
man in they year 1955 led to her arrest.  A 381 day protest and bus boycott by Montgomery's 
Black community was organized.  The success of that activity exposed the unconstitutional 
laws, customs and practices which were depriving America's Black people 
of full citizenship in many sections of the nation. Threats against their lives and
safety, forced the Parks family to leave Montgomery.  They finally decided to make
Detroit their permanent home in 1958.

During this national Bi-Centennial year civil rights leaders in Detroit formed the
'National Committee for the Rosa L. Parks Shrine'.  The Committee's purpose is to build
a permanent home on the new boulevard recently named for Mrs. Parks.  Detroit's 12th
Street was the scene of the most destructive of the many ""civil rebellions"" which
occurred in the 1960's.  It is now officially, ROSA PARKS BOULEVARD, and
concurrently with the construction of a new residential/commercial complex
sponsored by a local citizens association, we hope to build a home for Mrs. Parks.

Ribbon cutting ceremonies for Rosa Parks Boulevard took place on July 14, 1976.
The National Committee for the Rosa L. Parks Shrine premiered the musical 'Selma' at
Detroit's Music Hall on Aug. 10.  Following that event the 'Shrine Committee' leaders
opened an account at Detroit's First Independence National Bank which is Black
owned and operated; and will serve as depository for the fund raising campaign.

The goal of the National Committee for the Rosa L. Parks Shrine is to raise a sufficient
amount to cover construction, maintenance and eventual enshrinement of the residence.  
It is expected to be built near the northern entrance of Rosa Parks Boulevard.
Mrs. Parks will live in the residence with her husband and her 88 year old mother.

The members of the Citizen's Action Group, Inc. welcome you in celebrating
this wonderful and noteworthy occasion. We feel that this celebration, that
has been spread nationwide, is long overdue as has been quoted by several
interested and concerned persons. It was planned to demonstrate our appreciation
of a lady whose courage and heroic acts sparked a chain of events which
affected the course of this Nation's history and improved the living conditions
of millions of people. This reflects upon the role Mrs. Parks played in helping
shape and mold the future course of the Civil Rights Movement in Montgomery
and in America. We are happy that you, too, saw fit to share with use, the opportunity
to lend ourselves in paying tribute and demonstrating our undying and
everlasting appreciation for what Mrs. Parks achieved and for which she so
firmly stood.

What could be a better time than the eve of July 4th in this Bicentennial
year to pay tribute to Mrs. Rosa Parks, the Mother of the Civil Rights Movement
in America.

Governor of the State of Michigan
presents this
Executive Declaration
in Observance of
MRS. ROSA PARKS' CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT
Twenty years have passed since Mrs. Rosa Parks was arrested for not
succumbing to Jim Crowism.  With dignity and grace, Mrs. Parks refused 
to give up her seat on a bus to a white man in Montgomery, Alabama.
Her arrest followed, and so did the Montgomery bus boycott.

The Montgomery bus boycott eventually broke the back of some of the
city's hardest segregation laws, thus giving tangible signs of hope to 
Black Americans throughout the Deep South and nationwide.  One year
after the boycott, which began on December 13, 1956, the United States
Supreme Court invalidated Montgomery's bus segregation laws.

The bus boycott gave birth to the Southern Christian Leadership Conference 
and several other organizations; it reinspired others to work
for equality and justice in this country; and it gave rise to marches,
confrontations and constructive legislation to end discrimination.

Mrs. Parks is known to many as the mother of the Civil Rights Movement.
For her contributions to making the U.S. Constitution an instrument of
hope and life, I pay tribute to this lady.

Therefore, I, William G. Milliken, Governor of the State of Michigan,
do hereby give special recognition to Mrs. Rosa Parks for her contributions 
to human civilization, and I urge all Michigan citizens to pay 
tribute to her.

Given under my hand on this twenty-
ninth day of April in the year of
Our Lord one thousand nine hundred
seventy-six and of the Commonwealth
one hundred fortieth.
William G. Milliken
GOVERNOR




Rosa Parks 

Biographical Sketch

Rosa Parks is the living symbol of the passive resistance movement in the
United States.  When she refused to vacate her bus seat to a white man in the
south, she slapped the face of segregation.  Because she had so lived among her
fellow human beings a person slow to anger, courteous and disciplined, the
revolt of resistance that followed touched the hearts of the world.  Her act dealt
a lethal blow to segregation.  Her act resulted in 98 percent of the 50,000 blacks
of Montgomery, Alabama, the seat of the Confederacy, to walk with her in 
protest to her arrest during that famous bus boycott.  They walked 381 days
non-violently until the city bus lines were integrated.  From that one great demonstration 
a multitude of others have taken seed and grown and blossomed into 
the hearts of many.

Rosa Parks is a living symbol of the Civil Rights Movement.  Reports are
here and abroad that she is the ""Mother of the Revolution.""  She did not plan
that revolt - it just happened that way.  In her heart she knew some change
should take place as she told the policeman who came to arrest her the day it
all happened, ""Why do you people treat us so badly . . . always shoving us
around?""  She never suspected the role in history she was destined to play
because she got tired of it all.  Rosa wanted a change in attitudes for all people,
especially those making unjust laws and persons obeying them so meekly.

Rosa Parks is a God fearing woman . . . ask anyone that is well-acquainted
with her.  They will tell you that she is a down to earth person who works with
the underprivileged, the elite, the church-goer, the non-church affiliate of all
races, and never loses sight on the goal of dignity and freedom for all.  It is her
belief that to free the oppressed is to free the oppressor.

Mrs. Parks was born in Tuskegee, Alabama, the only daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. James McCauley.  She attended school in Montgomery and graduated from
Alabama State Teacher's College High School.  Her training as a seamstress began
early at her mother's knee.  Rosa's father, now deceased, was a competent
carpenter and Sylvester McCauley, her brother, follows that trade until today.
Mrs. Parks' mother, Leona, a former school teacher was and is a profound
influence in Rosa's life.  She is currently with Rosa and her husband, Mr. Raymond
A. Parks.

Mr. Parks' history in civil rights dates back to the days of the Scottsboro
case of Alabama.  During his career as a barber in the south, he catered to a large
private clientele of white patrons.  This gave him an insight into many facts and
facets that may not have been at his disposal had he limited himself to merely
working at his shop.  When Mrs. Parks became nationally identified with the
civil rights movement, Mr. Parks was to be found right at her side as they
worked cleaning up the debris from the bombed-out homes of the citizenry.
Their activities resulted in financial reverses, stresses and strains to such a degree
that illness has now limited Mr. Parks' activities.  He endorses and encourages
Rosa's militant participation in the civil rights movement.  Because of Mr. Parks'
illness and the retiring years of her mother, Rosa's brother prevailed upon them
to leave Alabama and reside in Detroit, Michigan where he and his family have 
lived for many years.

The late Dr. Martin Luther King on speaking of Rosa Parks said, ""her courage 
and dedication will be an inspiration to generations yet unborn . . . that
you have done for all America, your creative witness was the great fuse that
led to the modern stride toward freedom."""

Dear
Recently, The Citizens Action Group, Inc.,
was formed to pay honor, recognition, and
tribute to Mrs. Rosa Parks for her Civil Rights
Posture, December, 1955 in Montgomery, Alabama.
You have been referred to us as a person
who would desire supporting such an observance.
We further request your being identified as a
Member of The Citizens Action Group, Inc.
Being a Member of The Citizens Action
Group, Inc., permits you to become a Sponsor.
We have set the Sponsorship Contribution at a
minimum of $50.00, which is tax deductible.  In
respect to your being amenable to this gesture,
your name will appear in our Souvenir Program
as a Sponsor.
Although the date of this history making
event was December, 1955, the Protest Bus Boycott 
March followed during the Spring of 1956,
led by the late Dr. Martin Luther King.  Consequently, 
our Program will culminate May 16,
1976, at Cobo Hall, in keeping as closely as
possible to the same time of the Protest March.
In order to allow us ample time to do the
many things necessary, we need your confirmation 
immediately.

LIFT EVERY VOICE AND SING

Lift every voice and sing
Till earth and heaven ring
Ring with the harmonies of Liberty;
Let our rejoicing rise,
High as the listening skies,
Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.
Sing a song full of faith that the dark past taught us.
Sing a song full of hope that the present has brought us. 
Facing the rising sun of our new day begun, 
Let us march on till victory is won.

Stony the road we trod
Bitter the chastening rod,
Felt in the days when hope unborn had died
Yet with a steady beat, have not our weary feet
Come to the place for which our fathers sighed?
We have come over a way that with tears have been watered,
We have come, treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered, 
Out of the gloomy past, till now we stand at last
Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast.

God of our weary years, God of our silent tears,
Thou who hast brought us thus far on our way,
Thou who hast by thy might, led us into the light,
Keep us forever in the path we pray, 
Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met Thee, 
Lest our hearts, drunk with the wine of the world we forget Thee,
Shadowed beneath Thy hand, may we forever stand
True to our God, true to our Native Land.

The Black Contemporary Players present
A Day of Absence
A sitirical contemporary play about a
Southern town that wakes up one morning 
and finds all it's ""nigras"" are
gone.  The play is performed by black 
people in ""white face"".

The Black Contemporary Players group was formed about

Rosa Parks was born February 4, 1913 in Tuskegee,
Alabama.  She attended a one room school in Tuskegee
from grades 1 through 5.

Mrs. Park's mother moved to Montgomery, Alabama
where Mrs. Parks received a work scholarship to Mrs.
White's All Girl School.  The owner and administrator,
Mrs. Alice White, offered occupational courses, such
as cooking and sewing.  The school had an all white
staff and was considered quite a fashinable establishment.

Mrs. Parks was employed at the Fair Department
Store in Montgomery in 1955.  She was a very ardent
worker for the NAACP and served as a Junior Sponsor.

Mrs. Park's refusal to give up her bus seat in
the ""colored section"" of the bus to a white man touched
off the celebrated Montgomery boycott.  As a result
of her spontaneous decision to keep her seat, the Black
clergy in Montgomery formed the Montgomery Improvement
Association.  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was chosen
as the head of this organization.  The bus boycott in 
Montgomery made Dr. King the central figure in the
civil-rights movement.

It has been said, ""The day she sat down, the whole
world stood up.""

Mrs. Parks is married and lives with her husband
and mother in Detroit, Michigan.

     In January of 1971, Rev. E. Woody Hall called together a 
group of Bethel members to make plans for African Methodist Episcopal Education Week. At this meeting, it was decided to observe Education 
Week by studying Black History. Mr. Edward Bessley, the well known 
black historian, helped the planning committee to formulate a meaningful three-day program.
     The programs were held February 14, 1971 through February 16, 
1971. ""The Church Within and Beyond Black Power and The Revolution"" 
was chosen as the theme.
     A number of area people participated on the programs: Mr. Edward 
Bessley, Mrs. Dorothy Wade, Mr. Chester Anderson, Mrs. Gloria Terrell, 
Mr. Joseph Tillmon and Mr. Maurice Harper. These persons were largely responsible for the success of the programs.
     Question and answer sessions were encouraged each night which 
allowed for participation by everyone present.
     Because of the enthusiastic response to the 1971 programs by 
both the Bethel and outside community, Black History Week is being 
repeated this year.
     This book is dedicated to the memory of those black people who 
have gone before us, both the renowned and the unknown who struggled, suffered and died to gain freedom for us!
     We must not allow ourselves to forget our black history, for it is 
upon our past that our present progress is built. If we allow ourselves 
to forget and become compacent, there will be no progress in the future. Hence, we present these Black History programs -- lest we forget!

Erected in 1889, Mother Bethel, stands on the oldest plot of
land in the country continuously owned by Negroes.  The present building
is the fourth built on the site where Richard Allen and Absalom Jones
founded the Free African Society in 1887.  The society developed into
the African Methodist Episcopal Church, one of the largest and most
influential Negro denominations in the country.  Allen was the
denomination's first bishop.
Born a slave, Allen became a Minister and circuit rider after
obtaining his freedom. Throughout his life he was a leader of the
Negro Community and anti-slavery groups.
With Jones and James Forten, a Negro sail-maker who built up a
$100,000 fortune, Allen organized a force of 2,500 free Negroes to
defend Philadelphia against the British in 1814.  In 1830, he led
the first Negro Convention in Philadelphia, the first large formal
organization dedicated to anti-slavery agitation.  Allen is entombed
in a basement vault at Mother Bethel.  Adjoining the tomb is a room
containing the original pulpit used by Allen and Jones and various
relics and artifacts of the two men and their times.

As Mayor of the City of Fayetteville, it is my pleasure to congratulate the
NSA for their efforts in creating a successful ""New Freedom Bell"" ceremony
to commemorate the adoption of the United States Constitution in 1787.

As we in North Carolina prepare for the celebration of the Bicentennial
of the Ratification of the U. S. Constitution, it seems only logical to
recognize the New Freedom Bell which symbolizes independence and liberty
across our nation.

I appreciate the work of the NSA to promote and coordinate activities

New Freedom Bell Day
1987
By the Governor of the State of North Carolina
A Proclamation
The year of our Lord, nineteen hundred and eighty-seven, 
marks the bicentennial of the United States Constitution. We 
in North Carolina are particularly proud that three of our 
native sons were guardians of the great document: Presidents 
Andrew Jackson, Andrew Johnson, and James K. Polk.
Along with our constitution, another great national 
symbol of our dedication to the principles of freedom and 
democracy is the Liberty Bell, permanently displayed in 
Philadelphia. The New Freedom Bell is a certified, exact 
replica of that Liberty Bell which rang out for freedom more 
than two hundred years ago. It, too, is a symbol of a fresh 
start, a reawakening, and a renewed vigor in our effort 
toward obtaining world peace. 
The people of North Carolina, the sons and daughters of 
the Minutemen, are proud to have the New Freedom Bell on 
display on the lawn of the State Capitol in Raleigh, and 
grateful to toll the bell during its journey homeward to 
Philadelphia where it will be presented to that city on July 
3, 1987, as a lasting memorial to the efforts of all 
Americans that strive for peace.
NOW, THEREFORE, I, JAMES G MARTIN, Governor of the 
State of North Carolina, do hereby proclaim June 10, 1987, as 
""New Freedom Bell Day,"" in North Carolina, and urge all our 
citizens to join Nichiren Shoshu-Sokagakkai of America (NSA) 
in preserving the values and principles of our Constitution 
and in striving for peace and freedom, not only in America, 
but for all mankind.

JAMES G. MARTIN

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and 
affixed the Great Seal of the State of North Carolina at the 
Capitol of Raleigh this twenty-fifth day of June in the year 
of our Lord nineteen hundred and eight-seven, and of the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred 
and tenth.

Dear Patriots:

Your efforts in promoting peace, justice and freedom is commendable 
and appreciated by all who have shared in the price of war and injustice.  
The people of Jacksonville and Camp Lejeune, North Carolina were shocked 
into this realization when, on October 23, 1983, 241 of our neighbors 
were sacrificed in an attempt to bring peace and harmony to a troubled 
land. 

As your members have done with the Freedom Bell, a symbol has been 
created in Jacksonville to honor the ones who paid the ultimate price and 
to insure we will never forget the terrible cost of the war.

We salute your efforts toward peace and wish you continued success 
in awakening the American spirit of patriotism.

Let the Freedom Bell ring forever!

Dear Mr. Williams:

Having visited the City of Philadelphia just this past
 December, and having stood in awe of the Liberty Bell in its historic 
setting across Independence Hall, I must say that the Bell 
symbolized for me, as I'm sure it does for many, the struggle of 
our country to become an independent democratic republic over 200 
years ago.  It is a beautiful symbol, and I believe one which 
inspires patriotism in all who view it.

I would therefore, like to congratulate both you and the 
members of the Nichiren Shoshu Sokagakkai of America for highly 
innovative program of national patriotism which you have effected 
on a grand scale.  The Idea of having the Freedom Bell Cast by 
the same foundry in England which cast our Liberty Bell, and 
bringing the Bell to America to commemorate the 200th anniversary 
of the United States Constitution, is an idea which seems to 
me beyond the scope of most human beings.  But, you are to be 
congratulated for not only having the imagination to initiate the 
plan but the wherewithal to carry the project to its completion.

You have provided this country with a very special way of 
commemorating this significant year in our history.  As your 
Freedom Bell concludes its nation-wide tour and moves to Philadelphia, 
I hope you can look back on the various ceremonies 
throughout the United States as having added in great measure to 
our nation's celebration of the 200th anniversary of the Constitution.  
From my point of view, it's a splendid project and 
again, one which you and your members can be congratulated.

Sincerely,

D. M. CAMPBELL

Dear Mr. McCloskey:

On behalf of the City of Birmingham, we would like to welcome the NSA
Freedom Bell to Alabama.  We understand the Freedom Bell will be in our
state Sunday, June 28, 1987.

We further understand that the Freedom Bell is a full-sized replica of the
original Liberty Bell, cast at the same foundry and with the same mold as
the original.  The Freedom Bell will be presented to the City of
Philadelphia for the entire nation by NSA during your Constitutional
Bicentennial Convention there July 4.

We have been advised that the Freedom Bell will be the centerpiece of a
special ceremony Monday, June 19, 1987 in Atlanta with such notables as
Mrs. Coretta Scott King, Atlanta city officials, and other dignitaries 
present.  We take this opportunity to commend NSA, which is striving to
establish world peace based on individual happiness and the dignity of
human life, for the historic Freedom Bell effort, a tour of some thirty
cities which began in Concord, Massachusetts where the shot ""heard round
the world"" was fired.

The Freedom Bell not only calls attention to the heritage of liberty of all
Americans, but as well speaks to the ongoing struggle for peace, freedom
and dignity throughout our nation and the world.  The tour promises to
reawaken a sense of true patriotism in our nation, a patriotism founded on
achieving the true ideals of the American Revolution, and the establishment
of a society with ""peace, liberty and justice for all.""

As Mayor of Birmingham, and on behalf of all her citizens, we commend
highly Nichiren Shoshu Sokagakkai of America for the historic NSA Freedom
Bell Movement this most significant year, the 200th Anniversary of the
United States Constitution.

Sincerely

Dear Mr. Williams:

It is my understanding that your organization is sponsoring
a nationwide tour of the New Freedom Bell in honor of our
nation's Constitutional Bicentennial, as it will be
presented to the City of Philadelphia on the Fourth of July.

I am pleased to see the success the New Freedom Bell Tour is
having, with hundreds of thousands of citizens having had
the opportunity to ring the Bell within the past two months.

Since Delaware was the first state to ratify the
Constitution, in addition to being located between
Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia, it would indeed mean very
much to our citizens should the New Freedom Bell stop in the
City of Wilmington on July 2.  If we were to meet together
in Rodney Square and join in ringing the Bell, then
Delawareans, too, could celebrate our freedom and happiness.

It would certainly be a memorable occasion.

Dear Mr. Williams:

Congratulations on NSA's 24th Annual General Meeting being
held in Philadelphia to celebrate the Bicentennial of the U.S.
Constitution!

On June 24th, citizens of San Antonio opened their hearts to
NSA as the NEW FREEDOM BELL arrived at the Alamo during the
nationwide tour toward Philadelphia.  Although I could not be with
you, I know that this event quickened the spirit of the founding
fathers within our citizens.

Especially meaningful to me is the excerpt from the NSA
Declaration of Peace stating the desire that there be ""no more
Alamos, no more Pearl Harbors, no more Hiroshimas, and no more
war"".  At this time in our history when there is distrust,
alienation, and few heroines and heroes for young people to
emulate, I find NSA like a breathe of hope for the future.
Seeing the youth of NSA so committed to making a better world for
themselves and for society at large, is indeed refreshing.

Best wishes for continued success with your Philadelphia 
activities!

MESSAGE FROM GOVERNOR JOHN WAIHEE

It is my pleasure to extend a warm Aloha to you and the members of the 
Nichiren Shoshu Soka Gakkai of America on the occasion of your 24th General 
meeting in Philadelphia.

Your Convention coincides with a special time in our history: our 
celebration of Independence Day and the Constitution's 200th birthday.  Both 
events mark the birth of the United States as a free and democratic nation.  
NSA's New Freedom Bell has journeyed across this entire nation, once more 
reaffirming that America is the great nation which our forefathers founded 
and fought for, a land of opportunity that has welcomed people from every 
part of the globe.

Through your outstanding community service, development of young 
leaders, and devotion to world peace, you have contributed immeasurably to 
the growth and progress of the United States.  Your dedication to the 
principles of liberty, freedom and justice, and your compassion and concern for 
your fellow citizens, have helped this nation to become stronger.

I am confident that your 24th NSA Convention will further inspire all 
NSA members to continue building on your exemplary record of service, and I 
wish you every success in your endeavors.

Dear Mr. Williams:

As you may know, this year Philadelphia, the nation and the world are celebrating
the 200th anniversary of the U.S. Constitution.  This celebration, headquartered 
in Philadelphia, will be one of the most exciting and memorable events of this
century.  I am please you have recognized the importance of this significant 
occasion by selecting Philadelphia as the location for NSA's annual national 
convention.  I am certain the 10,000 delegates attending this year's meeting 
will find Philadelphia to be very exciting, particularly since your conference 
coincides with our four-day observance of Independence Day called Freedom 
Festival.

You local staff representatives have contacted the Special Events Division 
of the Office of the City Representative to update us on your plans and to request 
NSA's participation in the July 3 Freedom Festival Parade.  It is my pleasure 
to invite the four groups from NSA, upon which our staffs have mutually agreed, 
to participate in the 1987 Freedom Festival Parade.  In addition, I would like 
to extend a formal invitation to Patrick Duffy to be the Grand Marshall of the 
parade.  It is my understanding Mr. Duffy will be attending the convention and 
may be willing to join us for the parade.

On behalf of the entire city, I would like to extend a warm Philadelphia welcome 
to you and your members.  It is always a great pleasure for me to see such 
enthusiastic participation in city events by groups like NSA.  I look forward 
to seeing you at the 1987 Freedom Festival Parade.

Sincerely,

""City of Brotherly Love"" on the 200th anniversary of the Constitution.

I would further like to congratulate you on the tremendously

to ring in Boston.  Since that day, I understand this Bell has 
traveled from coast to coast, ringing in every major city in the 
country.

NSA's presentation of the New Freedom Bell characterizes your 
dedication to reawakening the spirit of the Founding Fathers.  It 
inspires hope in every American's heart for a peaceful world in 
which we can all freely uphold the principles of our Constitution.

Dear Mr. Williams.:

I want to extend my sincerest congratulations to you and the 
members of NSA on your wonderful Freedom Bell campaign.  It is my 
understanding that the Bell, which was welcomed by New Yorkers at 
City Hall Park, has been across country to over 30 cities and 
thousands of citizens have had the opportunity to ring this 
authentic replica of our Liberty Bell.  Now, on the last leg of its 
journey, it will pass through our nation's capitol and finally come 
to rest in Philadelphia, where it will be part of our bicentennial 
celebration of the United States Constitution.

The many citizens of New York join me in extending to you 
and your many members from our city our appreciation for your 
continued efforts to work for world peace.

All the best.

Dear Mr. Williams:

It is with pleasure that I extend greetings to you and
members of NSA who have embarked on a journey to share the New Freedom
Bell with all of America.  Since you started on your journey, the Bell
has traveled across the country as a symbol of America's past.
Today, as I write to you, it is my hope that the Bell can
grow to symbolize the vision that I have for America's future.  I look
forward to a day when the philosophy of equality expressed in the U.S.
Constitution will be a reality.  I look to an America that takes an
uncompromising view at fulfilling the promises of the Declaration of
Independence and the Constitution and believe that these documents are
a call to all American citizens to fight for equality and justice.
The Bell will take on added significance in the City of
Philadelphia, where on July 3rd and 4th, it will be part of the
celebration of our nation's bicentennial of the Constitution.  As we 
commemorate the words of the framers with the tolls of the bells of 
freedom, we should view the occasion as a challenge to live out the
ideas which the framers set forth; that we the people may one day form
a perfect union.
Once again, I congratulate NSA and its members on their
journey.

Sincerely,
David N. Dinkins

The New Freedom Bell: Chapter 9

New Freedom Bell's 
Legacy Lives On

  The New Freedom Trail may 
have ended in Philadelphia, 
but the New Freedom Bell became 
a living legacy; its sound still 
reverberates in the hearts of all 
who rang it.
  More important, however, the 
New Freedom Bell became the single 
most conspicuous national effort 
to celebrate the two hundredth 
anniversary of the U.S. Constitution. 
Even the Weekly Reader, 
which is produced for the school-children 
of America, ran a picture 
of the Freedom Bell as part of its 
celebration of the Constitution. 
The bell reached every corner 
of America, and became a fitting 
symbol for groups participating in 
the bicentennial celebration 
throughout the country. 
  Long after all the ceremonies 
and celebrations were over, the 
Commission on the Bicentennial of 
the United States Constitution, 
chaired by former Supreme Court 
Chief Justice Warren Burger, wrote 
a letter to NSA General Director 
George M. Williams. The letter bore 
a handwritten inscription saying, 
""Congratulations! Your project was 
outstanding.""
  The New Freedom Bell, of 
course, was donated to the City of 
Philadelphia, where it remained 
even after the last of the NSA members 
left the city following the 24th 
NSA General Meeting. Recently, 
the city fathers decided that the 
bell would be put on display at the 
Philadelphia Civic Center, there to 
remain as a lasting tribute to the bicentennial 
of the U.S. Constitution. 
But the bell found still further use 
as the nation's leaders gathered in 
Philadelphia to mark the exact anniversary 
of the signing of the U.S. 
Constitution two centuries either.
  September 17, Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania: The New Freedom 
Bell, NSA's gift to the City of Philadelphia, 
was the centerpiece of 
the We the People 200 Parade 
honoring the bicentennial of the 
signing of the U.S. Constitution today.

released. Scores of schoolchildren
and Boy Scouts were on hand, along
with local citizens. As the ringing
continued, workers from nearby
City Hall came out to see what was

happening and ended up ringing the
bell, too.

Later in the day, the bell resumed 
its trek along the New Freedom 
Trail, stopping briefly that
evening in Houston to be hailed by
the local members, and then continuing 
on to New Orleans for its entry 
into the South, a territory that
President Thomas Jefferson had
purchased from Napoleon. From
here, at the mouth of the great Mississippi 
River, the New Freedom
Trail would soon head into the original 
thirteen colonies and its eventual 
destination, Philadelphia, historic
birthplace of the United States.

NEW FREEDOM BELL
We the People

The New Freedom Bell: Chapter 7

Visiting the Centers
of the New South

New Orleans-this was the
foothold of the French in
the New World. Situated
at the mouth of the mighty Mississippi 
River, it commanded the entry 
and exit from the great middle
expanse of the North American
continent. Settled in 1718, it stood
sentinel between the Spanish and
English settlements. The English
settlements eventually rebelled,
and the thirteen original colonies
became the United States of America. 
To the east of New Orleans, the
Spanish retained their hold on the
Florida peninsula, and to the west
they controlled what is now Mexico 
and parts of the modern-day
American Southwest.

It fell upon Thomas Jefferson to
seize the opportunity to incorporate 
New Orleans, being offered
for sale by the French under
Napoleon, into the United States of
America. In scenes reminiscent of
the current debate over the true
meaning of the Constitution (and
especially today, over the role of
the Supreme Court), Jefferson took
the position that, if the Constitution 

did not specify it, it could not
be done without an amendment.
He envisioned himself as a strict
constructionist and pondered the
constitutionality of such, a purchase. 
Thus, when it was learned
that Napoleon would sell the whole
Louisiana Territory and not just
New Orleans, Jefferson saw it as a 
great but illegal opportunity; the
Constitution did not empower the
President, or anyone else, to purchase 
land and add it to the body
of the country. After much internal
debate, he signed a treaty and submitted 
it to the U.S. Senate, still
considering the action unconstitutional, 
but the Senate quickly
bowed to popular sentiment and
agreed to the purchase.

Today, New Orleans is a popular
tourist spot, famed for its Mardi
Gras, its French Quarter and its
Bourbon Street, a stretch of pavement 
filled with the sounds of jazz
and the aroma of seafood. It was this 
historic city that the New Freedom
Trail reached toward the end of
June, two full months after embarking 
from Concord, Massachusetts.

for public presentations. If the 
bell were parked for a night, whether 
inside or out, regardless of the city, 
a team of young men would watch 
the bell until it left again for a ceremony 
or appointment. 
The young women in NSA were 
equally as active. At each stop and 
each New Freedom Bell ceremony, 
teams of young women would arrive 
early to arrange the public 
greetings and social amenities. 
They would patiently welcome 
each person and remain behind to 
make sure everything went without 
a hitch until the final moment 
when the bell departed. 
In addition, various NSA performing 
groups would be intimately 
involved with the ceremonies. 
The young men and young women 
each have groups, choruses for 
both, a fife and drum corps and 
drill dancing troupe for the young
 women, and a brass band and 
perhaps other groups for the young 
men- all in each locale. They would 
provide a youthful spirit to the 
proceedings. 
There are probably too many 
people and too many groups to 
recognize in one chapter, or perhaps 
in one book. But what really 
distinguished these volunteers was 
the spirit and dedication with 
which they approached everything.
As an offshoot of their faith, 
and in respect for the symbolism of 
the New Freedom Bell, the NSA 
members involved the New Freedom 
Trail were invariably models of

sincerity, helpfulness and enthusiasm. 
These aspects were remarked 
upon in town after town, by mayors 
and governors and citizen-spectators 
as well. But not one NSA member, 
it can surely be said, ever did a single 
thing in the hopes of winning 
praise or public recognition. The remarkable 
thing was that they were not only volunteers; they were 
pure and selfless as well.

Olympia is the state capital, and it 
was here that the New Freedom 
Bell made its next stop, following 
the success of the downtown Seattle 
ceremony. 
A man who was to play a big 
part in the Seattle NSA General 
Meeting in September, to be held 
over the Labor Day Weekend, was 
exposed to the organization as a 
result of this visit. This man, a genial 
but knowledgeable sort, was State Supreme Court Justice James 
M. Dolliver, who would end up addressing 
the NSA gathering in September 
on the significance of the 
U.S. Constitution. His words speak 
for themselves. 
""I must confess, when I received 
the literature on this and 
saw what this organization has 
done, I was really overwhelmed. 
Getting this bell all the way across 
the country has certainly been a 
tremendous job, and to all of you 
who are in this organization, I want 
to thank you very deeply for this. 
A lot of people, whether they are 
American citizens or not, get a 
catch in their throat when they 
hear or see the Liberty Bell. After 
all, the primary thing that those
 who fought in the Revolutionary 
War were interested in was gaining 
and preserving liberty.""

You who are to determine the future of kosen-rufu,
You who hold the key to the future of this world religion.
It is you, the true fighters!
With deep and firm awareness
Who shall shine forth with splendor
In the history of worldwide kosen-rufu.

The poet of the soul, Walt Whitman, writes:

""Oh soul, repressless, I with thee and thou with me,
The circumnavigation of the world begin,
Of man, the voyage of his mind's return,
To reason's early paradise.""

How profound and strong our karmic relation!
For we also are aware
Of what the great poet was after,
The ""early paradise"" is nothing
But the ""Buddha land"" free from decline,
It is nothing but the ""treasure land"" free from deterioration;
For that cause we stand up tall.
A single wave summons the second;
The second, the third;

18

And the third wave inevitably
Bears thousands and tens of thousands of waves to follow.
With this firm conviction in mind
We rise on the spirit of standing alone
Enabling others to reform the tenets that they hold in their hearts.
This is the toil for peace and kosen-rufu.
Behold, at this moment,
The glorious sun rises,
Tinting the surface of the Rockies in vermillion,
Cherishing the great prairies of Colorado in its golden embrace,
Transforming the waters of the Mississippi into crimson,
Shedding the morning rays of hope
On the windows of Manhattan high-rises.

Cherishing your dreams, my dearest friends,
A new dawn of kosen-rufu of America has come;
The door to the eternal journey toward the future has been opened.

Gallant pioneers of the Mystic Law,
Courageous fighters for peace,
Raise the anchor!  It is time to embark!

Toll the bell high and loud, again and again!
It is the bell of departure!
It is the bell of daybreak!
It is the bell of happiness!

Let us aim for the summit of eternal happiness in the new century,
Shining beyond the vast prairies.
This day, this very morning,
With great pride and conviction
Have we boldly launched
On a brand new voyage.

Parks for an alleged violation of the municipal and state ordinances and statutes requiring racial 
segregation of passengers on buses and the ensuing protest of the Negro citizens of Montgomery,
Alabama.  As council for this Association, Mr. Gray submitted the following statement to the Senate 
Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights after stating cases of violence and arrest:

""In conclusion, we would like particularly to emphasize the importance of those provisions in the bill 
designed to protect the right to vote.  Section #1 of Article 14 of our constitution provides that all 
persons born or naturalized in the United States are citizens of the United States as well as of 
the States wherein they reside.  Certain rights of citizenship, it is true, are guaranteed by our Federal 
Constitution but the enforcement of these rights depends in the final analysis upon fair and objective 
courts and law enforcement officials.  The judges and the chief law enforcement officials are, for the 
most part, elected officials.  As such, it is inevitable that they are likely to be responsive to the
 sentiments of those who put them into office and keep them there, and to overlook the sentiment and 
rights of those who have little or no voice in their election.  We firmly believe that if the Negroes of 
Montgomery, Alabama have the right to vote commensurate with their numbers and qualifications,
the Montgomery, Alabama Bus Protest of 1955-56 would not have occurred.

If this bill is approved by this committee and ultimately passed by Congress, it will mean the second 
emancipation for the American Negro.

We urge its passage.""

Dear Mr. Williams:

It is my understanding that your organization is sponsoring
a nationwide tour of the new Freedom Bell in honor of our
Nation's Constitutional Bicentennial, as it will be presented to
the City of Philadelphia on the 4th of July.

I am pleased to see the success that the new Freedom Bell
is having, with hundreds of thousands of citizens having had the
opportunity to ring the bell within the past 2 months.

Since Delaware was the First State to ratify the
Constitution, in addition to being located between Washington
and Philadelphia, it would indeed mean very much to our citizens
should the new Freedom Bell stop in the City of Wilmington on
July 2.  If our citizens were given the opportunity to meet at
Rodney Square and ring the bell, Delawareans too could celebrate
our freedom and happiness.

It would certainly be a memorable occasion.

Sincerely,
Michael N. Castle

Dear Mr. Williams:

I was deeply touched by the NSA ceremony honoring the New Freedom Bell in San
Francisco's Civic Center on June 8th.  It was an inspiration for me to participate,
and I congratulate the NSA for successfully arranging an event so impressive to so
many San Franciscans.

This and NSA's continuing endeavors in promoting peace and human happiness
have most certainly earned NSA an honored role as America celebrates the
Bicentennial of the United States Constitution.  I also wish you great success in
NSA's 24th All America General Meeting in Philadelphia -- city of the
Constitution's birth -- on July 4th.

Here in San Francisco, I applaud NSA's contributions to our society and culture,
and especially your efforts to assure worthy futures for capable young people of
the City.

Let us hope the success of the New Freedom Bell event holds promise that one
day we may see an NSA convention in San Francisco.  Meantime, you and SGI
President Daisaku Ikeda will always be welcome guests.

Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr. Williams:

I would like to congratulate you on the
occasion of your 24th NSA General Meeting being
held in Philadelphia on July 4th.

I have long been familiar with NSA's many
cultural activities and as Mayor of San Diego,
met your international president, Daisaku Ikeda.
Through your many colorful and spectacular
events, thousands of young Americans have been
inspired to learn to become better citizens and
capable leaders of the future.

The ""Freedom Bell"" tour sponsored by NSA
has given hundreds of thousands of Americans the
opportunity to view a part of their history, re-
awakening in themselves the spirit of our founding
fathers who pursued and accomplished the estab-
lishment of our Constitution.

Again, my best wishes for your continued 
success and the development of NSA.

Dear Mr. Williams:  George

On the occasion of the 24th NSA General Meeting and your celebration of
the Bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution held in the City of
Philadelphia, together with 7,000 members, it gives me great pleasure to
express my sincere congratulations and best wishes.

On Thursday morning, June 11th you brought to the front lawn of the
Los Angeles City Hall, the ""New Freedom Bell"" and a replica of the 
Statue of Liberty.  The citizens of this great city, people of all ages
were given the opportunity to ring the bell and be reminded of their 
proud heritage and of the unalienable rights guaranteed by our founding
fathers.

The city of Los Angeles has been the benefactor of many valuable
contributions in the area of culture and education by NSA. However,
most impressive has been your organization's ability to help many of our 
young people stand up and take responsibility for their lives.

NSA, under your leadership is a very proud part of our community, and I
anticipate your further advancement in the accomplishment of your most
noteworthy goals of peace and humanism for all people.

My personal thanks to you for bringing to our front lawn the replica of 
Lady Liberty.  Your thoughtfulness is certainly appreciated and
symbolizes the long and lasting friendship that we share.

Dear President Ikeda:
This past Sunday, May 3rd, I was deeply moved and honored in being
delegated to ring the NEW FREEDOM BELL, which was brought to
Niagara Falls, New York, by NSA.  It will awaken the spirit of our
Founding Fathers of 200 years ago in every American citizen today.
NSA's support of the dedication of the Bicentennial of the 
Constitution of the United States is most honorable and I was
proud to participate in this historic and memorable ""send-off"" of
the Bell across the United States.
I have been informed that this coming June, you will be visiting
Canada.  Two years ago, I welcomed the President of China to my
city.  I would be honored to welcome the President of SGI as well.
I am extending an invitation to you to cross the RAINBOW BRIDGE,
which connects the two countries of Canada and the United States.
I would be pleased to welcome you as the guest of my city and
present to you the Key to the City of Niagara Falls, New York.
I am aware of the dedicated efforts of your organization to promote
peace and develop international ties.  Here in Niagara Falls, where
Nature has given us the magnificent and might Cataracts which 
millions come to see annually, the spirit of peace prevails.
In closing, I would like to thank you for making possible the
NEW FREEDOM BELL TOUR to our city -- the KING OF POWER and the
QUEEN OF BEAUTY, and I look forward to welcoming you here as part of
NSA's movement toward a peaceful world in the twenty-first
century.

CITY OF PHILADELPHIA
Proclamation
To commemorate the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution, an
exact replica of the Liberty Bell was cast by Nichiren Shoshu Soka Gakkai of
America (NSA).
The New Freedom Bell was first rung on April 28, 1987 at the North Bridge
in Concord, Massachusetts, to rekindle the dreams of our people for a great
and peaceful America and to celebrate the birth of the United States
Constitution.
After touring the United States and being rung by over 300,000 people, the
New Freedom Bell was presented to Philadelphia by NSA, a member
organization of the Soka Gakkai International (SGI).
SGI, with over 17,000,000 members worldwide, promotes international
cooperation with cultural exchanges and meetings and teaches a philosophy
of peace and individual happiness.
The New Freedom Bell will go on a marathon tour of the ""World Freedom
Trail"" to reawaken in every human being the spirit embodied in the United
Nations Charter on the occasion of the United Nations 1988 Special Session
on Disarmament.
THEREFORE . . .
I, W. Wilson Goode, Mayor of the City of Philadelphia, do hereby proclaim
the
NEW FREEDOM BELL
as the City of Philadelphia International Ambassador of Peace and further
urge all people to ring this New Freedom Bell to reaffirm their determination
for a peaceful world in the 21st Century.
W. Wilson Goode
Mayor
Given under my hand and the Seal of the
City of Philadelphia, this first day of
January, one thousand, nine hundred
and eighty-seven.

Philadelphia Mayor W. Wilson Goode lent his good offices to the New Freedom
Bell one more time as the year 1988 approached. Issuing a proclamation making
the New Freedom Bell his city's 'International Ambassador of Peace,' he offered
his support to a World Freedom Trail with the hope that the bell could journey
throughout the world 'to reawaken in every human being the spirit embodied in
the United Nations Charter on the occasion of the United Nations 1988 Special Session 
on Disarmament.' His proclamation further urged 'all people to ring this New
Freedom Bell to reaffirm their determination for a peaceful world.'

Declaration of Peace

In commemoration of the 30th anniversary of second Soka
Gakkai President Josei Toda's historic declaration against the
use of nuclear weapons, NSA's Declaration of Peace is dedicated
to Soka Gakkai International President Daisaku Ikeda, who
has sparked the movement for world kosen-rufu.  This declaration, which will stand as NSA's determination for global peace, was delivered at the NSA West Coast General meeting in Seattle on September 6, 1987.

WHEREAS, this year marks the 30th anniversary of the declaration by second Soka Gakkai President Josei Toda on September 8, 1957, at Mitsuzawa Stadium in Yokohama, Japan, against the use of nuclear weapons when he said, ""We, the people of the world, have a right to live.  Any attempt to endanger this right is an act of the devil, an act of Satan and an act of a monster,"" the spirit of which should be emphasized in modern society and passed on to future generations of humanity; and 

WHEREAS, this year also commemorates the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution which we have celebrated through the mission of the NSA New Freedom Bell in more than thirty cities to rekindle the spirit of freedom, equality and the pursuit of happiness within the hearts and minds of the people of America, proclaiming our determination everywhere that there be ""No more Alamos, no more Pearl Harbors, no more Hiroshimas and no more war""; and

WHEREAS, the NSA programs in Philadelphia over the July 4th weekend were recognized by the mayor and other public officials of the city and state, together with the press and general public for their significant contribution to this Year of Peace and Community;

NOW, THEREFORE, as we conclude our 24th NSA General Meeting here in the City of Seattle, we unanimously resolve to adopt the following Proclamation of Peace:

108


ARTICLE I.  We, the members of NSA, who uphold the true Buddhism of Nichiren Daishonin which is based on the universal
dignity of human life, pledge to build a fortress of peace within
our lives as we carry out the noble spirit of the successive
presidents of the Soka Gakkai, holding high the banner of our
own human revolution.

ARTICLE II.  We, the members of NSA, pledge to contribute to the prosperity of American society by becoming excellent citizens who can manifest the noble spirit of the United States Constitution which is the basis of modern democracy.

ARTICLE III.  We, the members of NSA, who aim for the kosen-rufu of this haven of freedom, this republic of the people, pledge to build a peaceful society in our nation by forever following the guidance of SGI President Daisaku Ikeda, thus lighting the way to peace for all mankind.

the New Freedom Bell's journey 
along the New Freedom Trail was 
the repeated use of the NSA song, 
""Two Hundred Years from Now,"" 
which was originally penned for 
the Bicentennial Convention held 
by NSA in New York in 1976, and 
which was readapted for the 1987 
celebration of the U.S. Constitution. 
This song asks, rhetorically, 
""Where are we going to be two 
hundred years from now?/ What 
are we going to see two hundred 
years from now?""
The song does not really answer 
the question, but instead it poses a 
challenge to all who hear - and 
sing - it. What kind of world will we 
leave for our children and grandchildren? 
What will we do to make 
this a better world for all?  Important 
questions, but the answer to 
them lies in the commitment they 
call for - the commitment of each 
individual to work for a world at 
peace, a world where diverse peoples 
and diverse cultures can live 
harmoniously together; a world 
that the U.S. Constitution envisioned, 
and that the New Freedom 
Bell rang out to illuminate. 
Indeed, at the conclusion of the 
New Freedom Trail and at the close 
of a year spent celebrating the U.S. 
Constitution, perhaps it is only the 
words on the Liberty Bell itself, 
""Proclaim Liberty throughout all 
the Land unto all the Inhabitants 
Thereof,"" that can sum up what 
the New Freedom Bell stood for: It 
was a call to further carry out the 
sacred pledge that lies at the roots 
of the country, and to extend it 
throughout the world.
Already, tentative plans were 
being drawn up at the time of publication 
to send the New Freedom 

Children line up to ring the replica New
Freedom Bell at the Los Angeles County
celebration on September 17, 1987.

Bell around the world as an official 
""Ambassador of Peace"" from the 
City of Philadelphia, with the support 
of the Commission on the Bicentennial 
of the United States 
Constitution.  Carrying a message of 
global friendship as the Bell of 
Eternal Peace, the New Freedom 
Bell would complete its international 
mission before being placed 
permanently in the Philadelphia 
Civic Center. Whatever its immediate 
future while it awaited placement 
in the Civic Center, the New 
Freedom Bell had doubtlessly already 
accomplished much - both 
for America and the world.
Perhaps to rephrase things a bit, 
the New Freedom Bell tolled high 
and loud to ""proclaim the dignity 
of human life throughout the world, 
and to all the inhabitants thereof,"" 
in order to secure a better like ""Two 
Hundred Years from Now.""

which was used both in Philadelphia and Seattle for the NSA general meetings,
at a Los Angeles County Mall ceremony.

Los Angeles County Supervisors invited NSA to stage their event for them after
learning of the New Freedom Bell's nationwide journey.  The celebration was held
in downtown Los Angeles to mark the bicentennial of the signing of the Constitution,
observed September 17, 1987.

peace without our lives as we carry 
our the noble spirit of the successive 
presidents of the Soka Gakkai, 
holding high the banner of our own 
human revolution.""
Other parts also made reference 
to the New Freedom Bell and the 
pledge accompanying it that there 
be ""no more Alamos, no more Pearl 
Harbors, no more Hiroshimas and 
no more war."" 
Keying on both Josei Toda's 
declaration, made on September 8, 
1957 in Yokohama, Japan, and the 
new declaration, NSA General Director 
Williams said to the gathered 
members: 
""I am deeply convinced that the 
more people take faith in true Buddhism 
in this country, the more 
respect America will gain from the 
rest of the world. And because 
Americans can become beautiful 
once again, the country of America 
also will be able to restore its 
beauty. Truly, as Nichiren Daishonin's 
Buddhism spreads throughout 
the nation, our nation will receive 
more and more blessings from 
throughout the universe. As long as 
our nation is in perfect accord with 
the spirit of true Buddhism, the 
glorious future of our nation will be 
eternally guaranteed."" 
Both Washington Governor 
Booth Gardner and Seattle Mayor 
Charles Royer issued proclamations 
honoring the event, as did the King 
County Council. 
Neil Strother, a reporter for 
KING-TV news, was enthusiastic after 
attending the meeting: ""This is 
just like the Olympics! That's how 

I would describe the excitement 
here today. When I read the press 
release, however, telling about this 
event, I didn't understand what 
Buddhism had to do with the U.S 
Constitution. But after being here, 
talking with some of the NSA members 
and seeing this, I have a much 
better understanding about the 
connection between the two. The 
Constitution is a charter for humankind 
and here you have people 
of all different backgrounds representing 
that charter. It's great!""
His cameraman, Bruce Huston, 
added: ""Well, I tell you, I certainly 
wasn't expecting this. I thought 
I would be taking pictures of people 
just talking. I had no idea I was 
in for such a colorful, physical display. 
There's so many people and 
they're so happy. They really show 
a lot of unity. It's nice. A very nice 
surprise. Not at all what I expected 
to see.""
Officials of the pavilion, which 
celebrated its sixtieth anniversary 
in 1987, were ecstatic over the new 
look of their arena, asking NSA officials 
if they could leave the decorations 
behind when they left. Of 
course, the props would all be 
needed later and could not stay 
behind. 
Thus, even while the actual New 
Freedom Bell was being readied for 
the Constitution Day Parade in Philadelphia, 
NSA members were holding 
their own Constitutional Convention 
to chart their course for the 
future, ever mindful of the need to 
secure a better world for all.

Dear Mr.  Williams:
Thank you for responding to our request for photographs
of your group's participation in the commemoration
of the Bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution.  The
interest and enthusiasm that you have demonstrated is
greatly appreciated.  The efforts of you and others
around the country made this celebration of Citizenship
Day and our Constitution's Bicentennial a fitting tribute
to this magnificent document.
With these photographs, the Commission will be able
to pictorially show the enthusiasm that was emitted
throughout the country.  In big cities and small towns
people congregated to honor and celebrate the Constitution.
The Commission can now share these moments with
other interested citizens.
Since the celebration of the Constitution will
continue through 1991, the commemoration of the Bill of
Rights, the Commission looks forward to your continued
participation in the Celebration of the United States
Constitution.
If you have any questions, please feel free to call
me, at (202) 653-5377.
Sincerely,
Gertrude Fry
Associate Director
Private Sector Initiatives
Congratulations!
Your project
was outstanding.

A New Big Bell
Children saw a new bell.
Many children rang the bell.
Understandings: A new bell was made.  It was named the New Freedom Bell.
It looks like the Liberty Bell.  The new bell was taken to 30 cities.  Now it is in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

The New Freedom Bell won friends wherever it went along the New Freedom
Trail.  After the trail was completed and the nationwide celebration of the Constitution's
bicentennial was over, the Commission on the Bicentennial of the
United States Constitution sent a letter of thanks to NSA General Director Williams
(left).  And the Weekly Reader introduced the New Freedom Bell to the
children of America with its issue of September 25, 1987 (right).

pieces from Seattle, including a 
massive statue of George Washington 
copied from the one on the 
University of Washington campus, 
were assembled at Los Angeles
County Mall for today's constitutional 
celebration. 
The focus of everything of 
course, was the 14-foot New Freedom 
Bell, which rang out loud and 
clear for the morning ceremony, attended 
by some 2,000 county employees 
and interested spectators. 
Supervisors Mike Antonovich and 
Kenneth Hahn and Chief Administrative 
Officer Richard B. Dixon 
were present to represent the 
county. 
The ceremony was held, of 
course, to coincide with the two 
hundredth anniversary of the signing 
of the U.S Constitution. 
Representing NSA General Director 
Williams, Vice General Director Ted 

Fujioka observed: ""It is in moments 
like these that we are sharing today 
that we can reflect, in this wonderful 
setting on our future- and to 
know that there is a future because 
of such young people. These are the 
moments which make the greatest 
difference in our lives.""  
One of the special guests, Evelyn 
Gutierrez of the County Administrator's 
office, was so overwhelmed by 
the proceedings that she exclaimed: 
""There's so much talent! So much 
enthusiasm! It's Inspiring to see so 
much support for the Constitution. 
I can't wait to ring the bell."" With 
that, she joined a quickly forming 
line of youngsters and spectators 
who were anxious to get a chance to 
ring in a bit of history. The ceremony 
closed with schoolchildren ringing 
the bell for two hundred straight seconds, 
symbolic of the bicentennial 
of the Constitution.

The pavilion, using props and staging from Philadelphia, had been transformed into a greatly enlarged Independence Hall for the meeting.  here, the ""new"" New Freedom Bell met up with an old friend, Washington State Supreme Court Justice James Dolliver.

In his remarks, Justice Dolliver termed the Constitution a document ""for ordinary people with all our faults, all our differences... to govern ourselves in a state of freedom"" and noted that its drafters had intended for this document to be a model for all mankind.  After reading out loud the Preamble to the Constitution, he concluded, ""It's our Constitution.  Let's love it.""

Justice Dolliver was also impressed by the energy and enthusiasm of the participants.  After watching the show which preceded the formal part of the meeting, he remarked, ""If I could figure out some way to bottle all the energy and good humor here and sell it, I could retire for life.""

In a more reflective vein, he said: ""I was in Olympia, Washington earlier this year when the New Freedom Bell passed through our state.  At that time I was most impressed with NSA's efforts to rekindle the spirit of our forefathers in establishing America.  I am equally as impressed today, seeing the thousands of young people in NSA who have come to Seattle to continue celebrating our nation's Constitution.  Any organization that would put forth so much effort into a particular cause must truly believe in it deeply.  I can't even begin to imagine the effort it took to send the New Freedom Bell around the country.  Similarly, I am sure that some kind of dedication went into this gathering here at the Hec Edmundson Pavilion by the members of NSA.

""I am the father of six children and I have tried to instill in them the principles upon which our country was built.  Today, you hear and see so much about the problems facing young people, but I am an optimist and feel that the majority of young people want to lead productive, happy lives.  That's certainly evident by the young people here today.  I am especially happy to see that they are being exposed to such things as the U.S. Constitution and its significance.  I think that too many of today's young people have not been given the opportunity to recall much of our country's history.  I feel that once they are given the opportunity, as NSA is sharing with its young members, there will be even more reason for optimism about the future of our country and the world.

""In NSA you have people of all races and backgrounds, and this is in fact how the world should be - different people living together, regardless of their circumstances in life.""

The meeting also featured a new Declaration of Peace, this one written in honor of the thirteenth anniversary of second Soka Gakkai President Josei Toda's own declaration against the employment of nuclear weapons, which also called for the further enhancement of the dignity of human life through spreading faith in Nichiren Daishonin's Buddhism.

some 15,000 people from various 
groups-unions, ethnic organizations 
and civic groups-marched as 
a tribute to the diversity fostered 
by American freedom under the 
Constitution. 
Parade host Brent Musburger, 
the well-known CBS sportscaster,
called the celebration ""the outstanding 
event of the year, not of the
decade, but of the century."" And the
New Freedom Bell was at the center 
of it all. 
While the New Freedom Bell remained
in Philadelphia following the
July 4th General Meeting, NSA continued 
its celebration of the U.S.
Constitution on two more occasions. 
For these events, the NSA stage crew

utilized many of the props used at 
the Spectrum event, including the
37-foot-tall chair-stage, but since it 
had no New Freedom Bell, it had to 
reconstruct one. Over a hand-made
steel frame, the crew sprayed a coat
of polyurethane foam and then 
carved a 14-foot replica New Freedom 
Bell, complete with a ringing
mechanism-a cord which triggered
a recording of the sound of the real 
bell. The stage preparations, carried
out in Seattle itself, attracted the attention 
of the local media, including
a KOMO-TV news crew.

Billing this meeting as its 
own ""Constitutional Convention,""

of the United States Constitution.
With this Constitution Day 
celebration, the yearlong efforts of
We the People 200 reached their 
conclusion, commemorating the
day two hundred years ago when
thirty-nine men in Independence
Hall affixed their signatures to the 
fourth and final page of the document
now celebrated as the world's
oldest surviving constitution.
Half a million people lined the
streets to watch the parade, and
millions more watched the first
three hours live on television.
In June, after seeing a video of
the New Freedom Bell's nationwide
tour, Fred Stein, executive director
of We the People 200, made
a request to NSA General Director
George M. Williams for the bell to
be included in the Constitution Day
festivities.  In so doing, he called the
New Freedom Trail ""the single
most significant national celebration""
of the Constitution.
Today's parade was only the 
third national parade ever held in
honor of the Constitution.  The first
was the Grand Federal Procession
held July 4, 1788 to celebrate the
ratification of the Constitution by 
the necessary nine states.  The next
was held on the centennial of the
signing, September 17, 1887.
The bicentennial parade was
planned as a moving pageant in 
three acts.  The first act was to
recreate the Grand Federal Procession;
the second was a dynamic illustration 
of the Preamble to the 
Constitution, and the third, featuring
the New Freedom Bell, comprised 
a trio of floats representing
the phrase, ""do ordain and establish
this Constitution.""  At the center
of this procession was the New
Freedom Bell float, symbolizing the
original Liberty Bell, flanked by the 
American eagle and the U.S. flag
floats.
President  Reagan entered to
""Ruffles and Flourishes"" as the
floats stopped in front of the
reviewing stand.  Following his address,
the Virginia Polytechnic Institute
Band played ""Stars and
Stripes Forever"" as the three symbolic 
floats moved once again down
historic Chestnut Street, site of the
July 3rd parade as well.  As the parade
continued, some 1,500 doves
and thousands of red, white and
blue balloons were released into
the air above Independence Mall.
At a parade rehearsal the evening
before, producer Barnett Lipton
insisted that the bell be rung all 
the way down the street.  ""I love
that bell,"" he said, commenting on
its pure tone which he had heard
for the first time that day.  Tolling
loud and clear for the cheering
crowds lining the parade route, the
New Freedom Bell seemed to symbolize 
the exuberant spirit of the
day.  George Pinchock, parade organizer 
and executive director of
July's Freedom Festival Parade,
said, ""It's really great to see the
New Freedom Bell being used to
celebrate this spectacular day.  The
Constitution Day Parade is what
the New Freedom Bell is all about.""
A great many people seemed to 
agree.  When the bell stood silent,
both before and after the parade,
one person after another came asking
to hear it ring and to take pictures
of it.  The NSA young men's
division members riding the float
were only too glad to oblige.
In the parade's final segment,

The New Freedom Bell is rung heartily to open the NSA General Meeting, which saluted the City of Philadelphia and the United States Constitution.

In presenting the bell, Mr. Williams exclaimed, ""Long live the Constitution!  Long live the City of Philadelphia!  Long live freedom!""

Mayor Goode said he was ""proud to accept this gift of freedom.""  It is a reminder, he said, ""of the fifty-five men who came together here two hundred years ago to give us the Constitution that has influenced the course of democracy around the world.""

Then, he and Mr. Williams rang the New Freedom Bell seven times, tolling it ""high and loud"" in the city to which it was dedicated on this summer's evening.

After viewing the parade, which featured a great percentage of NSA groups, Frank Conforti of the Philadelphia Police Department remarked, ""It's great to see young people with a clear look in their eyes.  If all the youth of America could have the glow that these kids have, we'd have no problems in this country.""

Added William Marrazzo, city commissioner for the Water Department: ""I'm overwhelmed by the obvious spirit of NSA, which conveyed the connection between very positive values and putting them into action.  I'm particularly glad that my children were here to see this.""

July 4, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: This was NSA's day.  Some 7,500 members from throughout the fifty states gathered at the Spectrum for the organization's 24th General Meeting.  The New Freedom Bell was also present, as was Philadelphia Mayor Goode and local U.S. Congressman Thomas Foglietta.

The scene was bathed in patriotic hues.  The entire arena had been transformed into a replica Independence Hall.  The hall's chandelier, enlarged tens of times, hung from the rafters, courtesy of the NSA stage crew.  The stage itself was a huge replica of the chair used by George Washington when he presided over the Constitutional Convention, again a product of the stage crew.  Around the circumference of the building hung window frames; through these peered the faces of the Founding Fathers, along with that of Soka Gakkai International President Daisaku Ikeda.  The delegates, as they chose to view themselves, were all dressed as colonial patriots.  Indeed, the scene was set for a resounding affirmation of the principles which set America free, and which now can be extended and refined to the point of securing life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness for all humanity.

Both Mayor Goode and Congressman Foglietta showed up in business suits, in contrast to the costumes of the members.  Once the New Freedom Bell rang to commence the proceedings, however, the two dignitaries were swept up in the tide of events.  Congressman Foglietta, who along with Mayor Goode had viewed the NSA cultural presentation preceding the General Meeting, remarked,"" Never have I ever seen anything like the coordination, dedication and enthusiasm that you have brought to the City of Philadelphia today.""  Mayor Goode continued his thoughts by saying, ""I am delighted to have you in our city.  You brought something new here.  You brought enthusiasm!""  The two of them then donned colonial garb and heartily rang the New Freedom Bell with General Director Williams."

fact, the Museum of Art, where
members had prepared and awaited
all morning through the rain.
More than 2,000 of them had
gathered to welcome the bell, and
when its entourage neared the
museum, they could no longer contain
their enthusiasm. They
released hundreds of red, white
and blue balloons and sang ""Two
Hundred Years From Now"" to commemorate
the occasion.
   With strong emotion, Mr. Williams
explained, ""We have now
brought the New Freedom Bell all
over the United States of America.
We have gathered with governors,
congressmen, senators and citizens
young and old. Many people rang
the bell with tears in their eyes, so
happy to hear the sound of the bell
in America once again.
   ""As the bell rings on, the City of 
Philadelphia will be at peace, and
the whole world will be at peace in
the 21st century. With such hope,
courage and confidence, let's create
a new century--a peaceful,
prosperous and happy century for 
all mankind.""
   At the close of the ceremony, in
""Rocky"" style (the first ""Rocky""
movie featured a scene of the protagonist
running up the steps of the
Philadelphia Museum of Art), Mr.
Williams then dashed up the stairs
himself as the NSA Brass Band
played the ""Theme from Rocky.""
Many of the members followed 
him, elated over the great success
enjoyed along the New Freedom
Trail.
   A representative of Philadelphia
Mayor W. Wilson Goode, Judy
Faye, was present to welcome Mr.
Williams and the New Freedom
Bell. She exclaimed, ""I will
never--as long as I live--forget this
ceremony. It's the most incredible
thing that ever happened to me. I
should be thanking you for the opportunity
to be part of this.
   ""In the past two weeks, I've met
many NSA members and I'm so impressed
with your professionalism
and how organized you are. Your
New Freedom Bell is more than just
a symbolic gesture. It's something
people can reach out and touch.""
   Still being rung by members
aboard its traveling platform, the
New Freedom Bell was driven away
to the cheers of the participants, as
preparations got under way for the
Freedom Festival Parade of the following
evening.
   July 3, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania:
NSA floats, marching
units, performing groups and even
a gymnastics squad on roller skates
formed the heart and soul of this
evening's Freedom Festival Parade
in Philadelphia, this time honoring
the two hundredth anniversary of
the Constitutional Convention held
here in 1787. But, of course, the
star of the parade was the New
Freedom Bell itself, borne atop a
glistening red, white and blue float
created especially for the occasion.
   Mayor Goode rode the length of
the parade with Grand Marshal
Patrick Duffy, television star and
long-time NSA member. At the
reviewing stand, set up in front of
Independence Hall where the Constitution
was drafted and signed,
Grand Marshal Duffy introduced
Mayor Goode to NSA General Director
Williams, who presented the
New Freedom Bell to the Mayor
and the City. Of course, the two had
met previously, but this was a special
moment.

Camden, the home of the poet Walt Whitman who is cited in Daisaku Ikeda's poem, ""Arise, the Sun of the Century,"" was represented by most of its local civic leaders at the event, including Mayor Melvin R. Primas, Jr., State Senator Walter Rand, Federal District Court Judge Joseph Rodriguez, State Assemblyman Wayne Bryant, Rutgers Law School Professor Alfred Blaustein, Camden City Council President Gwendolyn Faison and council members George Miller and Alfred Palumbo.

In effect, the whole city government of Camden turned out to ring the New Freedom Bell, largely because of the enthusiasm and efforts of Camden City Manager Rick Cummings, who is also a long-time member of NSA. The officials all came and stayed despite the on-again, off-again rain and the delay in the arrival of the New Freedom Bell from Valley Forge. 

Interestingly, Professor Blaustein, who spoke on the U.S. Constitution at the ceremony, is one of the nation's leading experts on the document and has helped many newly independent nations write their constitutions. 

Several busloads of senior citizens arrived for the event from the city's nearby senior citizen housing. A few days afterward, one elderly woman wrote Mayor Primas that she had lived all her life in Camden and had never seen anything like this. She was so glad to have lived to see it and felt it was a turning point for the city.

Camden has suffered deeply from urban blight in the past couple of decades and is just now experiencing something of a renaissance. Corporations such as the Campbell Soup Company, head-quartered in the city, have decided to remain and help improve Camden. Perhaps the ringing of the New Freedom Bell here tolled a new future for the whole area.

July 2, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: 

The New Freedom Bell rang victoriously in the streets of Philadelphia this afternoon as NSA General Director Williams himself drove the bell into the city. Following the ceremony in Camden, the bell was escorted over the Benjamin Franklin Bridge from New Jersey into Pennsylvania, as NSA members with American flags from New York and New Jersey lined the walkways on the bridge to greet the long awaited caravan. As Mr. Williams drove his precious cargo from from one state to another, the New Freedom Bell was run continuously.  Once the procession reached Pennsylvania, the constant, pouring rain ceased and the sun broke through radiantly, as if a curtain in the sky had opened to welcome home the New Freedom Bell. 

The bell's arrival into the city was given some unsolicited media attention by the popular Walt MacDonald of the Shadow Traffic Service, whose helicopter followed the bell's progress over the Benjamin Franklin Bridge and into the city, while he offered steady commentary over KYW Radio News. Another popular reporter, Walt Hunter of KYW-TV, commented on the crowds gathering at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

Following remarks by Mr. Williams,
and with the song, ""Two
Hundred Years from Now"" playing
in the background, the ringing of
the bell commenced. The bell resounded
throughout the beautiful
rolling hills of Valley Forge, creating
a most dramatic effect, one that
will no doubt be cherished by all
those present.
This was the only event of the 
New Freedom Bell's entire tour
which was held exclusively for the 
members of NSA, except for one
person--John Tyler of the Valley
Forge National Historical Park who
was present to ring the bell hand in
hand with Mr. Williams. He later
remarked: ""The real Liberty Bell
was a great symbol for freedom, 
and it's good to have a resurgence
of this. All of these things in American
life that relate to our past--the
Liberty Bell, the Statue of Liberty,
Valley Forge--are cultural benchmarks
that people can touch and
gain strength from the future.
It is so significant when we can
physically go back and become
renewed from our past.""

Freedom Bell was positioned at the 
Reflecting Pool with the 
Washington Monument glistening 
in its still waters from the distance. 
Behind the monument stood the 
Capitol, and in front of the bell, 
only yards away, the Lincoln 
Memorial, the capital's most popular 
tourist attraction, solemnly 
watching over the proceedings. Sir 
Antony Ackland, the British Ambassador 
to the United States, was 
the event's honored guest. His 
presence represented the bridge of 
harmony between the United 
States and Great Britain that has 
been established over the decades 
since the American Revolution. Today, 
that harmony was symbolized 
by the New Freedom Bell.
The brief ceremony attracted 
tourists from the nearby Lincoln 
Memorial and Vietnam Veterans' 
Memorial. Once the ringing of the 
bell commenced, however, the 
ranks of the crowd swelled as the 
bell's sound attracted nearly everyone 
from the two memorials, both 
short walking distances away.

nation's capital, the New Freedom 
Bell ended its short but historic 
one-day stay in Washington D.C., 
ready to begin its final journey

at historic Rodney Square in the 
heart of the central business district 
here.
Despite torrential rains which 
had bedeviled the rush-hour 
traffic, as the time for the ceremony 
drew near, a large crowd 
gathered. As the rains subsided, 
the temperature remained cool and 
the sky slightly overcast, almost as 
if the whole site were being air conditioned 
for the day's event.
Some 150 American flags 
provided a colorful backdrop for 
the New Freedom Bell ceremony. A 
statue of Caesar Rodney, one of the 
original signers of the Declaration 
of Independence, rose dramatically 
on horseback above the crowd in 
the square named after him. 
Despite suffering from cancer, Rodney 
rode all night on horseback to 
break the tie in the Delaware delegation 
and thus swing the vote in 
favor or the Declaration of Independence.
Wilmington the city has a motto,
""A Place To Be Somebody,"" and 
its history is intricately intertwined 
with that of both the Declaration of 
Independence and the U.S. Constitution. 
Wilmington was the first
city of the first state to ratify the
U.S. Constitution. Accordingly, the 
state's motto is ""First in Freedom.""
The New Freedom Bell ceremony 
opened with a color guard of 
young men from NSA in Minuteman 
uniforms. After they presented 
the colors, the national anthem
was sung.
Wilmington Mayor Daniel S. 
Frawley complimented the NSA 
members on the impressive way 
they had set up everything for the 
morning ceremony. Then, pointing 
to the rain-free skies, he remarked, 
""Someone must be looking out for 
you today."" He read a proclamation 
from Delaware Governor Mike Castle 
making this ""NSA New Freedom 
Day,"" and the ringing began.
July 2, Valley Forge, Pennsylvania: 
Following its stop in Wilmington, 
the New Freedom Bell 
traveled to historic Valley Forge at 
noontime, escorted by mounted 
police and also a police car.
It was here in Valley Forge, during 
the winter of 1777-78 that 
George Washington conducted six 
months of grueling military training 
for his troops, preparing them 
for the next engagement with the 
British. Washington and his men 
were forced to endure some of the 
severest conditions imaginable-
harsh weather, inadequate food 
and shelter and the onset of various 
diseases. By the time winter had 
ended, only about half the men had 
survived; but those who did were 
filled with incredible determination 
and strength of character to 
make up for their losses. Victory on 
the battlefield quickly ensued.
  NSA General Director Williams 
has on occasion selected Valley 
Forge as the setting for important 
NSA gatherings, especially with the 
youth division members.
Such was the case today as more 
than 4,000 youthful members from 
throughout the United States, who 
had come to Philadelphia to welcome 
the New Freedom Bell and 
attend the NSA 24th General Meeting, 
assembled at Valley Forge for a 
New Freedom Bell ceremony. True 
to the legacy of Valley Forge, heavy 
rains began to fall just before the 
start of the ceremony. Rather than 
discourage the participants, however, 
the downpour only served to 
charge everyone's spirit.

Through the years, the largely
English-speaking colonists had
sought ways to sever their ties with
the Old World, largely over issues of
economic and personal freedom.  In
1643, four colonies had formed the
New England Confederation; in
1686, seven colonies had grouped 
themselves as the Dominion of New
England; in 1754, there was the Albany
Congress of seven colonies,
and in 1765 the Stamp Act Congress
with nine colonies.  By 1772, all
thirteen colonies (Georgia, South
Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia,
Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania,
New Jersey, New York, Connecticut,
Rhode Island, Massachusetts
and New Hampshire) had agreed to
form Committees of Correspondence,
a loose confederation.  In
1774, twelve colonies formed what
was called The Association at the
First Continental Congress.  The
Second Continental Congress
declared independence in 1776,
and in 1781 the Articles of Confederation
created a thirteen-state 
confederation with weak central
authority.  So in 1787, delegates met
again for a Constitutional Convention
to rectify the ills of confederation;
the result was the United
States of America.
In other words, Philadelphia
played a major role in the history of
the United States, serving as its
birthplace; Washington, D.C. has
since become the site of national
unity and power.  It was only fitting,
then, that the New Freedom Trail's
last leg should take it the roughly 
one hundred miles from Washington,
D.C. to Philadelphia, from the
present to the past, with a decided

eye toward the future.
July 1, Washington, D.C.: The
New Freedom Bell made a triumphant
entry into the nation's capital
today and was tolled ""high and
loud"" at three separate ceremonies-
in front of the U.S. Capitol, in
the center of the District at
Western Plaza, and finally by the
Reflecting Pool in front of the Lincoln
Memorial.
In a figurative sense, the bell actually
opened the nation's legislative
agenda as more than thirty
Congressmen and their aides
gathered for a 9:00 a.m. ceremony
prior to the opening gavel of
Congress.
With the east front of the
Capitol looming in the background,
the New Freedom bell was stationed
in a small park near the
Capitol parking lot.  U.S. Congressman
Daniel Akaka from Hawaii
gave the order to unveil the bell,
and the ceremony commenced.  After
brief remarks by NSA General
Director Williams and the reading
of the Declaration of Peace, the two
Senators, seventeen Members of
Congress and many Congressional
representatives took turns ringing
the New Freedom Bell.  Remarked
U.S. Senator Howell Heflin from
Alabama: ""Ringing this bell has a
historic flavor, of pageantry aspect,
to it.  It makes us very conscious of 
the bicentennial of our Constitution.
I thought the Declaration of
Peace was excellent.  It centered on
our hopes and dreams for the future.
I hope that we can keep the
meaning of the Declaration of
Peace embedded in our hearts for
a long, long time.""
Added North Dakota Senator
Quentin Burdick: ""This is my first
time ever ringing such a large and

impressive bell.  I think it is most appropriate
at this time in our history,
celebrating the bicentennial of the
U.S. Constitution, to have such a 
ceremony with participants of all
races and nationalities.  This is a
great way to kick off the Fourth of
July.""
Indiana Congressman Dan Burton
added: ""This was very patriotic
-very heartwarming. To think that 
two hundred years ago this country
was fighting for its freedom, and
now to see this bell!  It represents
everything that we've accomplished.
This reaffirms my own commitment 
to keep the United States
strong and free, so that two hundred
years from now, my great-great-

great-grandchildren will be able to
enjoy this country and its heritage.""
As passers-by stopped to admire
and ring the bell, General Director
Williams spoke with as many of 
them as he could, explaining the
purpose of the bell and the route of
the New Freedom Trail.
One woman, an immigrant from
Poland, was in tears upon speaking 
with Mr. Williams about the bell.
""May freedom ring forever,"" she 
said.  ""You don't know what it is until
you have it.""  She expressed her
fondest hope that the New Freedom
Bell could someday visit her
homeland.

State House of the Pennsylvania Province.  It was planned and designed by the lawyer 
Andrew Hamilton, and is considered a fine example of Georgian architecture.  
It served as the meeting place for the Second Continental Congress from 1775 to 
1783, except for a period of British occupation.  George Washington was appointed 
commander-in-chief of the Continental Army here in 1775, and on July 4, 1776,

The New Freedom Bell:  Chapter 8

From the U.S. Capital 
to the U.S. Birthplace

On July 1, the New Freedom 
Bell found itself in 
Washington, D.C., the capital 
of the United States of America.  
As with most things American, 
the selection of this site as the nation's 
capital was in itself a bit of 
skillful compromising and politicking.  
Alexander Hamilton, the nation's 
first Secretary of the 
Treasury, wanted to seal the national 
unity by assuming at the national 
level the debts that had been 
accrued by the states during the 
Revolutionary War.  The state of Virginia, 
leading the states with the  
fewest debts, opposed Hamilton.  
The U.S. Constitution, however, 
had mandated that a ""District of 
Columbia"" be established to house 
the halls of government.  Using this 
as a bargaining chip, Hamilton got 
Virginia to agree to his plan for a 
national debt in return for the right 
to establish the District of Columbia 
along the Potomac River, near 
Virginia territory.  In 1790, the compromise 
was adopted.  On December 
6, 1790, the federal government 
moved to Philadelphia until the 

District of Columbia was completed in 1800.
At the time of the colonists' 
thrust for independence, the 
emerging nation had a population 
of little more than 2.5 million people, 
ninety-five percent of whom 
were rural inhabitants.  Hardly any 
urban center could be called a city 
by today's standards.  Philadelphia, 
with 34,000 inhabitants in 1775, 
was the largest community in the 
nation, so it was only natural that 
both the Second Continental Congress, 
which issued the Declaration
of Independence in 1776, and the 
Constitutional Convention of 1787 
met in Philadelphia.  After the 
Constitution was ratified by the 
states, the nation's first group of 
electors convened in 1789 to unanimously 
elect George Washington 
President, even though he did not 
desire the position.  Assuming his 
post, he set up the first federal government 
in New York City.  Eleven 
years later, after an interlude in
Philadelphia, the capital was moved 
to what, in fact, became its own entity, 
the District of Columbia (later

Freedom Bell took a spur here to
Raleigh, where many of the state's
top leaders gathered for the ceremony,
including Governor Martin,
Lieutenant Governor Robert Jordan,
State Supreme Court Chief Justice
James G. Exum, Jr. and Secretary of
State Thad Eure.

At the ceremony, the unveiling of
the bell was accomplished by Lieutenant
Governor Jordan, who remarked
that ""what began in 1776
continues today as move to keep
a free nation and a free world alive.""

Governor Martin, who had
proclaimed today ""New Freedom
Bell Day"" throughout the state,
chose to speak on the courage of the

delegates to the 1787 Constitutional
Convention in Philadelphia. ""It
was their mutual conviction that
here on these American shores they
would raise a light unto all
nations--a light of self-government,
of liberty and of hope. . . .The Freedom
Bell is a reminder of that light
and that hope.""

Declaring that ""I'm so glad to be
here in North Carolina,"" Mr. Williams
spoke if the New Freedom
Bell's purpose: ""As a nation, we've
really forgotten the great liberty of
the United States, so for the past
two months we have sponsored this
great symbol of democracy, the
New Freedom Bell.  Today, it is here
for all Carolinians.""

North Carolina Secretary of State Thad Eure, the nation's longest serving elected
state official, rings the New Freedom Bell.

Richmond's Festival Park hosts the ceremony in the capital of Virginia--and 
the capital of the Old South--on the last day of June.

After the ceremony, Secretary of
State Thad Eure was visibly moved.
A robust 87, Mr. Eure as first elected
to his office in the same year
(1936) that President Franklin Roosevelt
was elected to his second term.
He is the longest serving elected
state official in the nation.  He
minced no words in saying, ""It [the
ceremony] was wonderful.  I was only
disappointed that they wouldn't let
me get to the microphone,  I wanted
to yell, 'Long live the Constitution!'""

June 30. Richmond, Virginia:
The New Freedom Bell took its place
in recently redone Festival Park,
which is now one of the city's most
popular attractions.  Virginia Lieutenant
Governor L. Douglas Wilder was
poetic in his remarks at the ceremony:
""Do what is good.  Demand
what is just.  Criticize what is wrong.
Make what is perfect more perfect.
Fix what is good to be better.  Never

rest until that better is best, and do it
for all that they should see. . .the
beacon light for the world to follow.""
He then rang the bell of peace and
happiness, and hundreds followed.

The New Freedom Bell was in
good company in this state. It was
here that Patrick Henry fumed, Thomas
Jefferson ruminated, James
Madison schemed and George Washington
sought solace after all his triumphs
and tribulations.  Greats all, they
found the land to their liking, and in
return dedicated ""their lives,
their fortune and their sacred honor""
to the cause of a free and independent
nation--to a free and
independent people--and to this day
their legacy remains our nation's, and
our people's, heritage.  On this day
the New Freedom Trail passed
through the heart of the nation's
roots on its way to the center of its
new federal power.

Bell ceremony.  A busy woman,
Mrs. King does not instantly commit
to an invitation to a public event.  Interestingly,
an NSA member employed 
at the center approached 
Mrs. King about participating,
reasoning that ""I knew once she put
it in her book, she would not change
it unless she was ill or some major
catastrophe occurred."" It took a
while, but eventually Mrs. King added
the New Freedom Bell ceremony
to ""her book"".

June 29, Atlanta, Georgia: The
ceremony took place in Woodruff
Park, and again it was a bright and
hot day.  Georgia Secretary of State
Max Cleland offered his observations
as vice chairman of the state's
Constitutional Bicentennial Commission:
""This event today has
helped me to reawaken my understanding
of the spirit of our Constitution
and of my duties as vice 
chairman,"" he said, and concluded,
""Our Constitution guarantees the
right to the pursuit of happiness, but
you have to catch up to this happiness
yourself.""

Just as her assistant had reasoned,
once Mrs. King made a commitment,
she kept it, and today was
no different. Her presence at Atlanta's
New Freedom Bell ceremony added
extra significance to the
proceedings.  Her remarks built like
a crescendo. 

She started as many speakers
had started, with remarks that ""the
New Freedom Bell embodies the
spirit of friendship and brotherhood
that flourishes between the good
people of NSA and Atlanta. It is a
shining symbol of our unshakable
commitment to the cause of liberty,
democracy and human rights.""

Then she waxed enthusiastic:

76

""Let the New Freedom Bell ring in
Atlanta. Let its echoing challenge
of liberty and democracy ring with
a burning urgency in the distant
and dusty corners of our nation.

""Let its bright promise of a nation
free from poverty, racism and
violence be fulfilled.

""When this day comes, America
will shine as a bright beacon of love
and brotherhood, a model of compassion
and decency for all humanity.
As we look to the heavens, we
will find the morning stars singing
together in all their radiant glory
and all God's children will chant
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.""

The ceremony was unique in
another way as well. A National
Guard armored vehicle with two
guardsmen arrived with Governor
Joe Frank Harris's proclamation
commending NSA, which was then
read during the proceedings.

Thus, on officially proclaimed
""NSA New Freedom Bell Day"" in
Atlanta and in Georgia as a whole,
the aspirations of Martin Luther
King Jr. merged with the great
movement of the New Freedom Bell
to help open a path toward a revival
of humanism in the 21st century. 

June 30, Raleigh, North Carolina:
This state has already supplied
three of the nation's Presidents.
Andrew Jackson, James Polk and
Andrew Johnson, and statues to all
three stand in front of the Capitol
here in Raleigh, the New Freedom
Bell's next stop.

Not part of the bell's original
itinerary, Raleigh was added just
two weeks previously when Governor
Director James Martin wrote NSA General
Director George M. Williams with
a personal request for the stopover.

As a result, instead of going
straight to Richmond, Virginia, the

NSA General Director Williams received a proclamation from North Carolina 
Governor James G. Martin at the ceremony in Raleigh.

The North Carolina State House draws a morning crowd as the New Freedom 
Bell is drawn to the city by the special request of Governor Martin.

Council President Taylor presented
a full council proclamation
naming this day ""NSA New Freedom

As the ringing of the New Freedom
Bell commenced, Chief Justice
Dixon said it was ""ringing in a new
era for this historic city."" Council
President Taylor helped he four-
year-old grandson, Terence Halloway,
pull the long bell-
rope and then had to 
persuade hum to let go.
Among the spectators
present, some of the
young ones had comments
of their own.
Crystal Peterson, 13, said
ringing the bell made
her feel good, and ""it
makes me think of freedom
now.""  Nine-year-
old Silva Holliday said
that it reminded her of
""those people who rang
it a long time ago.""
After the noontime
ceremony, the New
Freedom Bell was escorted
into the historic French Quarter,
where, stationed at Jackson
Square, it added its golden tones to
the sounds of jazz all around it.
It was here that a most touching
scene took place: One woman came
up to ring the bell and seemed visibly
moved.  Moments later, she
returned with another woman,
whom she helped ring the bell because
she was blind.  An incredible
smile of joy then came over the face
of the sightless woman, tapping
deep emotions in all present.

74 

A police escort had been assigned
to the bell's movement
throughout its visit. At first, only
one police car was in the convoy, but
as the bell left Lafayette Park, two
motorcycle policemen joined in.  By
the time the bell left Jackson
Square, four motorcycles were in escort.
No one, not even the police,
wanted to miss out on this opportunity.
June 28, Stone Mountain Park,

Georgia prepared for the arrival of
the New Freedom Bell, they made

their rounds among public officials
and influential citizens, seeking
kindred spirits and support for their
endeavor.  One of those they came to
know was Franklin Garrett, official
historian for the city of Atlanta and
an author of several books on the
South.  When he was told of the New
Freedom Bell, he recalled the only
visit of the Liberty Bell to Atlanta,
back in the 1800s. ""The original tour
was by train, which was heavily
guarded,"" he said. ""Will the Freedom
Bell be traveling by train also?""

An honor guard opens the ceremony in Atlanta, which was attended by civil rights activist Coretta Scott King and Georgia Secretary of State Max Cleland.

Actually, the bell arrived as it had
throughout the long New Freedom
Trail—by truck and trailer. This time,
however, the drivers were young
men from the local NSA organizations
who took turns at the wheel.
What's more, they were escorted all
the way from Louisiana to Washington,
D.C. by highway patrol and state
police cars.  The New Freedom Bell
was in good company as it made its
way to each destination.  The first
stop, complete with a Georgia State
Police escort, was at Stone Mountain
Park outside the city of Atlanta.
Here, carved in the side of a mountain,
are figures of the leaders of the
Old South during the Civil War, a
tribute to their courage and dedication. 
Civil rights leader Martin Luther 

King Jr. had once said, ""Let freedom
ring from Stone Mountain, Georgia
to Lookout Mountain, Tennessee.""
On a bright summer day—the
first after seventeen straight days of
rain—the New Freedom Bell rang
out in front of this mountainside
monument to the past, and in so doing,
it pointed the way to the future,
a future when brother need never
be pitted against brother again, and
hatred can be forever vanquished.
As the New Freedom Bell made
its way into Atlanta itself, it passed
the home where Martin Luther
King, Jr. was born.  His widow, Coretta

Luther King, Jr. Center for
Nonviolent Social Change, and she

June 26, New Orleans, Louisiana: 
Lafayette, the transplanted 
French soldier who became a 
colonial major general, had wintered 
with George Washington and 
the troops at Valley Forge in what 
proved to be the supreme test of 
their courage.  Fittingly, it was at 
Lafayette Park here in New Orleans 
that the New Freedom Bell was 
first unveiled today.  The park is located 
near many historic sites, including 
Gallier Hall, the original 
New Orleans City Hall.
Earlier, at dawn, the New Freedom 
Bell had made its way into New 
Orleans with a stop on the banks of 

the mighty Mississippi River, where 
local NSA members greeted it.  Now, 
it was journeying into the heart of 
one of America's most charming 
locales to ring its magic.
The NSA Big Jazz Band played

began arriving about 11:30 a.m.

more Alamos"" in NSA's Declaration
of Peace which accompanied the
New Freedom Bell.
Because of the city's historic significance,
and because of Mayor
Henry Cisneros's longstanding ties
with NSA (he has also visited SGI
President Ikeda in Japan and invited
him to visit San Antonio in
return), General Director Williams
himself attended the ceremony,
held under a blazing summer sun in
front of the Alamo.
On March 6, 1836, the Alamo
fell to the troops of the Mexican
General Santa Anna. Vastly outnumbered,
all 188 American
defenders were slain, but their
struggle against the odds served to
unite the territory. Only forty-six
days later, General Sam Houston,
with 800 troops, defeated Santa
Anna's superior army. The Republic
of Texas was thus born.
Today, the Alamo stands not
only for the cause of bravery on the
part of those trying to settle the
area, but also for mistrust, greed
and savage combat. The sounds of
the Freedom Bell echoing up
against this historic building thus
symbolically called forth a new era
of human friendship and peace,
with a cry of ""no more Alamos, no
more Pearl Harbors, no more
Hiroshimas and no more war.""
Today, San Antonio is a city of
various races and cultures blended
together harmoniously, and the
crowd of 2,500 that gathered for
the noontime ceremony represented
this reality.
On a day proclaimed by Mayor
Cisneros to be ""NSA New Freedom
Bell Day,"" General Director Williams
proclaimed the bell's ringing
to be ""the sound of peace and happiness""

and a pledge for a world of
""no more war.""
Because of his busy schedule,
Mr. Williams was not able to attend
most of the ceremonies along the
New Freedom Trail, having caught
up with the bell only recently in
Los Angeles. Now, he would accompany
it as much as he could leading
up to the presentation and ceremonies
in Philadelphia over Liberty
Weekend. Already, on June 23, he
had met with civic leaders and
press representatives in Philadelphia
to prepare the way for the arrival
of the New Freedom Bell.
On that occasion, at a press conference
at the Philadelphia Academy
of Music, Mr. Williams had
spoken of the purpose of the bell
and the NSA General Meeting to be
held in that city on July 4th. In doing
so, he had recapped the history
of NSA and also his own personal
struggles and realizations coming
from Japan to America to study,
and then falling in love with the
country and its traditions:
""In 1957, when I came to UCLA
to study the Constitution and the
laws of the United States, I was
completely amazed by the truly
democratic spirit of the nation,
which is best expressed in the
phrase, 'Spirit of '76.' Deep in my
heart, I felt, 'This is it! I've found
it!'
""Now, it is my conviction that
the world will be peaceful only
when each and every individual established
a true basis of peace
and happiness within his or her life.
This individual human revolution
represents a change of one's life
from within, instead of looking outside
to blame or criticize. When we
accomplish this individual human
revolution, I believe America will

68

be beautiful once again, and truly
will be 'the land of the free and the
home of the brave' forever.""
One day later, in San Antonio,
Mr. Williams was putting his conviction
into practice as he led the New
Freedom Bell ceremony along with
the city elders in front of the historic
Alamo.
Mayor Cisneros later praised
NSA and its New Freedom Bell,
saying, ""At this time in our history
where there is distrust, alienation,
and few heroines and heroes for
young people to emulate, I find
NSA like a breath of hope for the
future. Seeing the youth of NSA so
committed to making a better
world for themselves and for society
as large is indeed refreshing.""
June 25, Dallas, Texas: Observing
that ""As the New Freedom

Bell travels through Dallas on its
way to Philadelphia, the hearts of
Texans, and all Americans, travel
with you,"" Texas Governor Williams
P. Clemens, Jr. welcomed the visit
of the bell to both San Antonio and
Dallas, where it was presented
today.
The bell, arriving in the morning
from San Antonio, was set up
on its traveling platform in front of
the Dallas City Hall, where the
45-degree angle of the structure
provided welcomed shade for the
spectators and participants in the
11:00 a.m. ceremony. Beyond the
New Freedom Bell glistened the
skyline of Dallas, shining under a
cloudless sky and 95-degree heat.

June 23, El Paso, Texas: Continuing
its journey in the Southwest,
the New Freedom Bell was
welcomed this day by Mayor Jonathan
Rogers and many other local
and state officials. The bell was
rung continuously for three hours
at the El Paso Civic Center, a great
outpouring of local support.
Again, since El Paso is located
near the Mexican border, the participation
proved to be international.
Mayor Rogers himself, in
celebratory remarks, congratulated
the citizens of Ciudad Juarez

the Rainbow Bridge to enter the

where it began its journey toward the South.

Prior to the ceremony, local NSA
members had personally visited
nearby Indian reservations, of 
which there is a great concentration,
to invite as many of these native
Americans as possible.  One of 
those they visited, the acting executive
director of the Arizona
Commission on Indian Affairs, Tony
Machukay, not only attended the 
ceremony but became its principal
speaker.  When he was first contacted,
he was noncommittal until he
heard how it was all tied in with the
celebration of the U.S. Constitution.
The Constitution, he jumped
up to say, singled out and recognized 
American Indians in two separate
passages.
In the end, attendance was
great.  Represented were the Tonto
Apache, the Navajo, the Yavapai

Apache, the Salt River Indians, the 
Havasupai, Ak-Chin and Hualapai
tribes, and the Indian communities
from Camp Verde, Fort McDowell,
Fort Mojave and Fort Yuma.  In addition,
Miss Navajo Nation, Diane 
Taylor, and Miss Indian America,
Audra Arviso, attended in native
costume.
The Honorable Chief Justice
Frank X. Gordon of the Arizona Supreme
Court, Phoenix City Councilman
Paul Johnson and other
local dignitaries were also on hand.
The MetroCenter was indeed 
packed for the occasion, and lending
to the Southwestern flavor
were local NSA performing groups,
themselves dressed in Indian costumes.
Afterwards, Tony Machukay
remarked, ""It is always educational
to be part of a national event like

64

this.  That the Indian people were
invited to participate is a positive 
factor.  Our children need to learn
about fostering mutual understanding.""  
Another Indian representative
remarked that, unlike other
groups which invite the Indians 
and then ignore them, NSA showed
true concern from beginning to end.
In this statement, there could be no
greater observation on the meaning
of the New Freedom Bell as it made
its way along the New Freedom Trail
into every corner of America, and
into the hearts of every type of person
represented in this great melting
pot.  Truly, the New Freedom Bell
stood for the unity and commonality
of all humanity.
June 22, Albuquerque, New Mexico:
The New Freedom Trail 
reached the Land of Enchantment,
New Mexico, after traveling the
famed Route 66 and crossing the Rio
Grande into Albuquerque, a city
known as the gateway to the Southwest.
One woman from the United
Kingdom, E.E. (Eden) Mountbatten,
a member of NSA married to Jit 
Ning from Singapore, found herself
unexpectedly in New Mexico at the 
time of the bell's arrival.  Her husband, 
a graduate student in physics 
seeking his doctorate at Louisiana
State University, was suddenly
called to Los Alamos to conduct
studies on superconductivity, and
he and his wife were thus able to 
participate in the New Freedom
Bell movement.  At first, Ms. Mountbatten
did not particularly like the
idea of going to New Mexico, but

Next stop on the New Freedom
Bell's journey was in Nevada,
where local citizens gathered at the 
Las Vegas Transportation Center
for a chance to ring the bell.  Later,
the bell was taken to nearby Boulder
City, where its clear ringing
contrasted with--and in a way
paralleled--the energy contained
by nearby Hoover Dam, a great
public project of decades past.

After the New Freedom Bell rang through the streets of San Diego, it attracted
a crowd for the noontime ceremony at the County Administration Center.

June 17, Imperial Beach, California:
Just steps from the nation
of Mexico, Border Field State Park
hosted an international ceremony
this morning.  The mayor of Imperial
Beach, Henry Smith, was on
hand, as was Willie Blair, assistant
to San Diego Mayor Maureen
O'Connor, but more symbolic,
representatives from Mexico were
also on hand-Tijuana Police Chief
Eduardo Bravo Quintera and the 
Honorable Senor Jose M. Gonzalez.
Border Field State Park looks 
across the national boundary into
Tijuana, Mexico, where that city's 
bullfighting arena is clearly
visible-almost as if in arm's reach.
A simple chain-link fence separates
the two nations, and crowds had
gathered on both sides for the ceremony.
As NSA Betsy Rosses and
Minutemen strung the rope to the
New Freedom Bell through the
fence, citizens from the two nations 
were able to ring the bell at the 
same time.  Its golden tone resounded
across the border in a touching

The New Freedom Bell:  Chapter 6

Linking Diverse Races 
and Nationalities

When the New Freedom 
Bell departed the Los 
Angeles area for its 
journey south toward the U.S.-Mexico 
border, it was fitting that its 
send-off was at the NSA World 
Peace Ikeda Auditorium in the 
coastal community of Santa Monica, 
where NSA maintains its national 
headquarters.  Fitting, 
because it was here that the New 
Freedom Trail was symbolically 
launched by Soka Gakkai International 
President Daisaku Iseda 
when he presented his poem to the 
members of NSA, ""Arise, the Sun of 
the Century.""

Mr. Ikeda, who has long viewed 
the United States as a noble experiment 
in harmonizing in one society 
the world's nationalities and 
races, maintains the hope that the 
fountainhead for a new, cross-cultural 
civilization can arise from 
these shores, through the efforts of 
common people linking their hearts 
for the cause of peace and human 
dignity.  The bell seemed to carry 
this aspiration with it as it went 
throughout the country.  Indeed, 
the Freedom Bell, and all NSA activities 
in general, have a way of 
harmonizing, not polarizing, people.  
Observed Joe Kubek, one of 
the bell's permanent drivers, ""Nobody 
leaves this bell with a frown.  
It has an incredible ability to 
change people's attitudes.  Through 
this, I have seen that world peace 
is not an impossible dream.""

It might seem outlandish that a 
bell could symbolize world peace; 
but if the Liberty Bell, now resting 
in front of Independence Hall, 
could serve as a call to freedom, 
then its modern-day descendant, 
the New Freedom Bell, could certainly 
provide a focus for the next 
great task at hand, restoring sensibility 
and a respect for the dignity 
of human life to the world at large.  
For sure, the world is now linked 
globally through various communication 
media; what is lacking are 
heart-to-heart bonds among the 
peoples and cultures of the world.  
The New Freedom Trail, though 
confined by the time constraints to the 
U.S. mainland, aimed at forging 
such ties.

the city's elders and citizens turned

June 16, Santa Monica, California:
Outside the building where
SGI President Daisaku Ikeda presented
his poem, ""Arise, the Sun of 
the Century,"" which had inspired 
the New Freedom Trail, NSA members-
plus visiting members from
their sister organization in Japan,
the Soka Gakkai-saw the New
Freedom Bell off as it made its journey
south to San Diego, and from
there, back across the United
States, with a final destination of
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
After a brief meeting inside the
auditorium at the NSA headquarters
building, the international
members assembled outside to
greet the New Freedom Bell as it
arrived with a police escort. Balloons
rose into the summer evening
sky as the bell approached.
Ever mindful of the impact of 
NSA events upon the neighbors of
the headquarters building, General
Director Williams had asked the
members to go around and invite
the local residents to attend the
ceremony, and attend they did,
ringing the bell along with the
members from Japan and the United
States. Then, in a fitting send-off
to the bell, the local police escorted
the traveling trailer-platform
and truck off toward the beach as
the New Freedom Bell made its
way to the Christopher Columbus
Transcontinental Highway and its
continuing journey into history.

Professor Gary Nash of UCLA:
""There are a lot of people today
who are not willing to risk anything
to maintain or gain freedom. Today,
we have all made an important
statement -- we must continue to
speak out.""
Later in the afternoon, the bell
was transported to the Biltmore
Hotel in downtown Los Angeles
where a meeting of the state's bicentennial 
commission was being
held. While the bell was stationed
outside for all to ring, NSA members 
appeared inside, in dramatic
fashion, to perform to Neil Diamond's 
""America,"" turning a routine 
workshop meeting into a
rousing affair. This led Jeff Allen,
executive director of the California
Commission, to say, ""We've been
working for over a year to get people 
to participate in this bicentennial 
celebration. I think it was great
for NSA to expend the time and 
energy to participate in today's
event. NSA's costumes and music
added to the festive spirits.""
June 13, Long Beach, California: 
The city's Shoreline Park,
fronting the harbor where
the cruise ship Queen Mary rests as a
perpetual tourist attraction, served
as the focus for the New Freedom
Bell's continuing journey today.
Under bright skies, the ceremony
was held here with the attendance
of more than 8,500 people.
The NSA replica Statue of
Liberty, which had been used at
the Los Angeles City Hall ceremony, 
was again pressed into service. 
The scene was dramatic -- the 
Queen Mary in the background, the
Statue of Liberty in the foreground, 
with throngs of people
focusing on the New Freedom Bell
on a center stage.
In addition to the thousands of
spectators present, local and state
officials were on hand as well, including 
State Assemblymen Dave
Elder and Paul Zeltner, Long Beach
City Councilpersons Ray Grabinski,
Evan Anderson Braude and Jan
Hall, and Mayor Paul Richards of 
nearby Lynwood.
Assemblyman Zeltner told the 
crowd: ""This New Freedom Bell
will reawaken in every American
the spirit of our Founding Fathers
and will solidify the foundation of
hope, courage and confidence
towards a peaceful world in the
21st century.""
He added, ""I've always had an
uncontrollable desire to ring
the Liberty Bell. Today I can realize
that ambition!""
Among those thousands who
lined to ring the bell, 12-year-old
Veronica Delgado beamed, ""I feel
so special ringing the bell!"" Five-
year-old Murphy McMahon said,
""It was big! I want to learn more
about the real Liberty Bell."" Ten-
year-old Lavonda Jones added,
""Ringing the bell makes me want to
learn more about American
history.""
After Shoreline Park, the bell
journeyed to C.I.S. Elementary
School for a presentation.

The NSA replica Statue of Liberty,
which had been constructed for
the organization's general meeting
in New York on Liberty Weekend,
1986, was present also, silhouetted
against City Hall and the stage
holding the New Freedom Bell.
Present at the ceremony to help
out were NSA members Herbie
Hancock, the Academy Award-winning
musician; popular television
star Patrick Duffy of ""Dallas,""
and actor-producer John Astin.
Once again, hundreds of school-children
were present and were
able to ring the bell. Richard
Sasaki, one of the local NSA leaders,
recalls a touching sight toward
the end of the morning ceremony,
when spectators were invited to
ring the bell. A blind woman who
had been present for the ceremony
came up and asked to be able to feel
the bell, saying she had always
wanted to be able to ""see"" the real
Liberty Bell. He helped her, as she
tearfully ran her hands over the
bell to her own great delight.
After the ceremony, District Attorney
Ira Reiner said, ""The rest of
us could take some lessons from 
NSA."" Councilman Farrell added,
""I view today's event, part of the
national effort by NSA to celebrate
the values of the Constitution, as
comparable to Martin Luther King,
Jr.'s march in the '60s. That march
was appropriate for that decade;
today's event is appropriate for the 
'80s."" The same evening, the New
Freedom Bell was brought to Dodger
Stadium, where the local Dodgers
and the visiting Houston Astros
would square off for nine innings of 
baseball. But clearly, the New Freedom
Bell was the star of the night,

along with the show staged on the
playing field by local NSA members.
Performers numbered 1,200,
while spectators totaled 35,000. So,
the New Freedom Bell was offered
great exposure to a cross-section of
Los Angeles residents. After the 
pre-game show staged by NSA, the
bell was moved to home plate,
where, in an opening game ceremony,
Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda
and Houston Coach Yogi Berra
rang the bell, followed by a group
of Little Leaguers.
Said Lasorda: ""I was proud to
ring the bell. I'm honored to be living
in the greatest country in the 
world, and when a man gets an opportunity
to do something like that,
that's one of the greatest things
that can happen. I'm very, very honored.
Everybody else who has an
opportunity to ring that bell will
have the same feeling I have.""
Said Yogi Berra: ""You've got a
great group here--you've really got
some spirit here. My ears are still
ringing!""
A Little Leaguer, fourth-grader
Jeff Facer who rang the bell at
home plate, quipped, ""Is that what
it felt like before they broke the
Liberty Bell?""
June 12, Los Angeles, California:
The New Freedom Bell paid its
first visit to a university campus today,
stopping at the University of
California at Los Angeles, where
NSA General Director Williams had
attended graduate school. The
Westwood Plaza ceremony drew a
representative gathering of students.
Said one student, Anne Garcia:

The New Freedom Bell: Chapter 5
Advancing With 
the Frontier Spirit
Something must be said about 
the logistics of moving a two-
ton bell across the nation —
not just about moving a bell, but
about preserving it, holding ceremonies 
with it and showing it constantly 
in the best manner possible.
A trucking company could take it
across the country, but only a special 
group of people could do what 
was accomplished along the New 
Freedom Trail.
Consider each ceremony. First 
of all, someone had to contact local
officials to arrange permission for 
a ceremony; in other words, to secure 
a prominent public spot. Beyond 
that, however, because of the 
feeling attached to the New Freedon 
Bell, no one wanted to stop at
merely finding a public venue.  Official 
participation was also deemed
important. This work all had to be 
done before the bell could ever be
put on display in any city. Remember 
Cleveland: the local members
worked and prayed till the last 
minute to secure the site and the 
participation they desired.
Then, of course, the bell had to

Two drivers were assigned to 
the bell and its truck-trailer at all
times. Though they did most of the 
driving, in Wells Fargo fashion local 
members would often shuttle the
bell from city to city. More often, 
however, a caravan approach was
taken. For instance, for the journey
from Detroit to Chicago, the two
official drivers were from California 
and Texas and not at all familiar 
with that particular section of the 
country. The distance between the 
two cities is more than two hundred 
miles. To facilitate travel between 
the locales, two carloads of
young members from the destination 
city, Chicago, drove to the city
where the ceremony was being 
held, Detroit, and then escorted
the New Freedom Bell back. This 
entailed many hours of driving in 
one day - five hours each way, leaving 
early in the morning, then going 
back in the early evening.
Then, of course these same
young men, belonging to what is
called for the Soka (Value Creation)
Group, would be assigned to guard

and especially in the large cities,
the New Freedom Bell also made
stops at various public places and
shopping malls to afford passerby
the opportunity to ring it, without
actually holding formal ceremonies.
Many, many thousands of
citizens were thereby able to participate
in the New Freedom Trail.
Here in Seattle, the bell was transported
form spot to spot for two
days, ringing high and loud, before
the actual ceremony was held today.
In fact, demand was so high for
the bell that an unscheduled, impromptu
ceremony had been held
in Yakima, Washington, on the way
to Seattle.
The Municipal Plaza Building,
where the ceremony was held, is
adjacent to the largest building on
the West Coast, the recently finished
76-story Columbia Center.  At 
10:30 a.m., the bell was escorted

down Fifth Avenue by a special entourage
of four King County motorcycle
policemen.

journey from coast to coast.

May 26, Salt Lake City, Utah:
One of the nice things about state
capitols is that each day busloads of
schoolchildren are brought to visit
them.  Here in this state capitol, today
was no different--except for
the presence of NSA members with
a mission in mind, that mission being
to encourage those young people
visiting the government's
headquarters to take time to ring
the New Freedom Bell. In all, some
eight hundred such children were
able to ring the bell today.  In addition,
visitors from Israel, France,
Sweden, Czechoslovakia, South
Africa, Germany, Japan, Korea,
and Canada were present, and not
only rang the bell but signed the
Declaration of Peace as well.
So well were the local youth represented
today that a Girl Scout
appeared to offer a rendition

the future served, even as the past
was celebrated--youth being introduced
to the heritage of America
while at the same time becoming
part of the unfolding drama of the
coming century.
June 1, Seattle, Washington:
The Emerald City, it is said, is now
the most popular tourist destination
in the continental United
States.  Green and lush, set next to
Puget Sound and its access to myriad
islands and to Canada and Alaska
to the north, Seattle offers a lot.
Its discovery eluded Lewis and
Clark, but the New Freedom Bell,
taking advantage of modern transportation
facilities, made it here as
it ended the first transcontinental
leg from Northeast to Midwest to
Northwest, from snow to sun, to
rain, and back to sun.

May 22, Denver, Colorado: A
solid week of rain led up to today's
scheduled ceremony in Civic Center
Park, midway between the
Capitol and City Hall.  The members
had chanted Nam-myoho-rengekyo
sincerely--and unrestrainedly
--for the whole week to offer their
prayers for a sunny day, since sun

spelled success and rain spelled 
trouble for the ceremony.
Despite the weather, however,
the NSA organizers were determined

Judge Monica Reynolds of the

thanked NSA for reminding everyone
of the spirit of the Founding
Fathers.
For his part, Mayor Washington
said, ""The wonderful NSA family

American heritage.""
With local television cameras

of three million people of Chicago,
I hereby ring this bell,"" he exclaimed.
In an official proclamation,
he also named this ""NSA's

Prior to Chicago, the bell had 
traveled to Crete, Illinois, to an old

May 15, Indianapolis, Indiana:
The beautiful spring weather continued
as the New Freedom Bell appeared
in this city, with hundreds 
of schoolchildren lining up for a 
chance to ring it. The City County
Building Plaza played host to the 
ceremony.
May 16, Louisville, Kentucky:
The ceremony was held in Jefferson
Park across the street from City
Hall and the County Court House,
in which is enshrined one of the
few original copies of the Declaration
of Independence. The spirited
event opened with an honor guard
from nearby Fort Knox parading
the United States flag as the national
anthem was sung.
Representing NSA on the stage
was the Louisville Symphony conductor

the world. 
One of today's guest speakers,
Noah Weinstein, dean of Laclede

The New Freedom Bell: Chapter 4
In the Tracks of Lewis and Clark

Chicago: Sears constructed 
the world's tallest office 
building here.  Frank Sinatra 
crooned about it.  It is famed as the 
Windy City, a bustling, great and vibrant 
metropolis.  Yet in 1803, it was 
but a frontier outpost with a dozen 
cabins.  It was not even incorporated 
as a city until 1833.  Today, it is 
one of the nation's great hubs.  By the 
St. Lawrence Seaway, it can 
connect to the Atlantic Ocean.  
From its busy O'Hare Airport, it links the world.
Chicago caps a vast section of 
America sweeping up from New 
Orleans to the Canadian border, the 
majority of which Thomas Jefferson 
purchased from Napoleon in 
1803.  He paid $15 million out of the 
national coffers, using his powers as 
third U.S. President, to add greatly 
to the national expanse.  At the 
time, he faced opposition, but he 
pressed forward with his vision.  
The explorers Lewis and Clark soon 
pushed up the ""Great Muddy"" Missouri 
River all the way over the Rockies to the Columbia River, establishing 
a claim to ""Oregon 
Country.""  Their trek, starting in St. 
Louis, lasted from 1804 to 1806, 
while in 1805 and 1806 Zebulon M. 
Pike explored the western Louisiana 
Territory, venturing into 
Colorado and New Mexico.
The New Freedom Trail would 
pierce this vast territory, heading 
from Chicago down to Louisville 
and St. Louis and then toward the 
Northwest; but first it was to be 
hailed in the city by Lake Michigan.
May 12, Chicago, Illinois: This 
city's Daley Plaza, named for its 
famed and venerable mayor, 
Richard Daley, drew more than 
3,000 people this afternoon for the 
New Freedom Bell ceremony, 
presided over by the late Mayor 
Harold Washington.  On an unusually 
bright and hot springtime day, 
the ceremony colored the Gaza in 
patriotic hues with American flags 
everywhere and NSA members 
dressed symbolically in Minuteman 
and Betsy Ross costumes.  Surveying 
the scene, Mayor Washington 
said, ""We should have NSA here every day.""

Day."" The attendees also


signed the Declaration of Peace.
The local NSA volunteers were
happy, for just that morning, they 
still had not secured a spot for the
ceremony.  ""The final placement of
the New Freedom Bell in Public 
Square in downtown Cleveland was
a delightful surprise to all of us
working behind the scenes for the
New Freedom Bell,"" said Barb Peck,
a local NSA organizer. ""the downtown
center of the city is organized
in four quadrants or squares with
monuments and fountains in each
section.  Public Square is the most
famous section of the city with the
Soldiers and Sailors monument, a
statue of the city's founder and
other famous works of art.  Terminal
Tower, the tallest building in the
city, is situated at the top of the
square and in front of it the bell was
located.""

its way through the upper Midwest,

today in this city famous as the manufacturing
center of American automobiles.

city, from Wayne County, from Wayne
University and from the Afro-American
Museum joined the celebration.
The entire Detroit City
Council signed a ""Testimonial Resolution,""

a ""momentous occasion for our city,
our state and the people of our country
. . .a time to reawaken our dreams
of liberty and peace.""
Rosa Parks, an assistant to Congressman
John Conyers, was one of
the speakers.  Ms. Parks, of course,
was a seminal figure in the civil
'rights movement, being the first
Black to refuse to sit in the back of

the bus in times of segregation.  Her
actions led to new national awareness,
to new legislation, and to new
freedoms for all.  She know well the
meaning of freedom, and the bell
rang responsively in her hands.
The master of ceremonies was
Marcus Belgrave, a famous jazz musician
who has played with the likes of
Ray Charles and is now a member of
NSA.  He conveyed NSA General Director
Williams' thoughts on the
meaning of then New Freedom Bell
when he quoted these remarks: ""The
significance of the New Freedom Bell
is to reawaken in every American the
spirit of the Founding Fathers, who
pursued and accomplished the establishment
of liberty for all in this nation,
and to encourage Americans to
solidify a foundation of hope, courage
and confidence toward a peaceful
world in the 21st. century.""
After Detroit, the bell continued
its journey through the Midwest,
destination Chicago, the famous
Windy City and the starting point
for the next chapter of the ongoing
narrative.

used as a rallying point for the
youth of America, to help revive in
them the spirit that made the country
free, and the spirit which now
animates the quest for lasting

April 30, New York, New York:
One of the aspects of New York that
makes it both exciting and frustrating
is the lack of space, especially
parking space.  The New Freedom
Bell, traveling on its own platform
certainly needed a place to be lodged
when not being used for public
ceremonies.  This would prove to be
no problem in most cities, but in
New York, even the local NSA center
is a building without any parking of
its own.  Thus, the members had to
rely on the very basis of their belief
in Nichiren Daishonin's Buddhism
to protect the New Freedom Bell.
The practice of Nichiren Daishonin's
Buddhism is based upon
the chanting of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo,
or what is called the invocation
of the universal law of cause
and effect.  Each individual invokes 
this law for his own personal reasons,
but in group causes, the members
often chant together for their 
goals.  The goal in this case was to
take care of the New Freedom Bell
in New York, and thus to insure its 
successful public appearance.   This
meant they had no choice but to
chant for parking places for the bell,
and without fail, they were able to
find a spot each time they needed it.
After all, you could rent a spot for 
a mere car, but a truck/trailer?

Before the scheduled public ceremony
at City Hall, the members
were able to hold their own ringing
session in front of their community
center, which is across the street
from Union Square Park.  Actually,
the bell was positioned near the
park itself,  where members could
arrive by subway to participate.
The loud and clear ringing paved 
the way for the success of the actual
ceremony itself.
 Although neither Governor
Mario Cuomo nor Mayor Edward
Koch could attend, the New Freedom
Bell ceremony was held in City
Hall Park with the attendance of
three city councilmen, Rafael
Castaneira-Colon, Robert Dreyfuss
and Peter Vallone.  Councilman Vallone,
majority leader of the council,
remarked, ""You have rekindled
that same spirit of independence,
the same spirit which drove people
to pursue life, liberty.  When they 
hear that bell, Americans everywhere
will not forget that they live
in peace and freedom.""
The New York Times captured
the event in a photo, with the headline,
""Model of the Liberty Bell Begins
National Tour on its Way to
Philadelphia.""  The photo clearly 
showed the bell on its platform
fronted by NSA member dressed
in Minuteman and Betsy Ross
costumes, a sight that accompanied
the bell wherever it went.  Interestingly,
a man who knows the wonder
of freedom, and the price that
people are willing to pay for it, was
the one who took the photograph.
Dith Pran, survivor of the horrors of
Cambodia, was that photographer.
His story was movingly told in the
movie, ""The Killing Fields.""
Mr. Pran has kept up an ongoing
dialogue with NSA members ever

since.  He recently said:  ""I felt really
great when I rang the New Freedom
Bell.  I want to share in the
freedom of this country, which is
something we all want.  To be able
to have a chance to hear the sound
of freedom - I am very emotional
about this.  I wish everyone could
have a chance to hear this sound,
to come to the Free World and for
people throughout the world to experience
freedom.  While ringing
this bell, my heart was saying, ""Let
all the leaders around the world 
think about freedom, not about
killing.  Let the dictators hear this
cry and tell them not to be crazy 
and think people are animals, but 
rather to listen to their words, their
ideas.  When the people have freedom,
we can share our ideas, like
here in the United States.  We can
say anything and we can hear (anything).  
The leaders must listen to 
what the people want to say.  We
must hear the opinions of others.'
Inside my chest I feel so much pain.
I am always suffering, thinking
about how other people around the
world are suffering.  I want so much
for people to care, to say, ""We must
stop war.  We must talk.""  This is
what ringing the New Freedom Bell
meant to me.""

Never deviate from this course
Of ""faith finds expression in daily life.""

The magnificent future of the road to kosen-rufu and peace
Lies closer at hand
In the sure and steadfast progress of daily living;
That road is lit even brighter with your existence
As shining and brilliant examples of this faith.

Therefore, do not forget that Buddhism is reflected
In life, living and society;
Show action rooted in compassion for others
Be the proof as a person of value at work
Be the foundation of peace and happiness at home
And be the light of good sense in society.

No persuasion surpasses confidence,
No influence surpasses trust.
Faith shows validity
In the behavior of the people;
If this is so, I pray that you
Be praised by others as trusted persons
And models of good citizenship.

Behold the soaring Rockies,
The rugged ranges so old and unconquered,
Towering up against the skies
In dignity, as those who can be trusted;
Unmoved, even in the midst of raging storm.
My friends,
Like those Rocky Mountains,
Construct the mountain ranges of trust
That rise high into the sky and stay unshaken
The majestic ranges of capable people.

After receiving the New Freedom Bell from NSA, the City of Philadelphia discussed many possible sites to locate it for public display.  The Plaza, shown above, is part of the modern Philadelphia Civic Center, and was chosen as the final home for the bell.  Beginning its journey in Philadelphia after being procured by NSA, the New Freedom Bell traveled some 11,500 miles before returning home to Philadelphia and being accepted by Mayor W. Wilson Goode."

Pulse of the Republic
The deep root of democracy,
Refreshing spirit of pioneering,
The conviction in independence
Boundless space,
And the vitality of the states united.

I see varied and colorful images,
Songs of praise of America
Of all mankind
Revolve like a kaleidoscope,
Deep in my mind.

Since my youth, years ago,
Always beside me have been Emerson and Whitman;
Together we discoursed - a dialogue of the heart;
The land they so loved and had pride in,
The land I too longed for,
It is the haven of hope - America!

Though there are signs
Here and everywhere
That you are ailing,
Your inherent energy
Like boiling hot magma
Only waits the moment of explosion.

From where is the cause of this union born?
This throng that now stands, assembled so valiantly - 
They are the fighters, emerging from the Earth
Courageous ones in tens of thousands;
Oh my dearest fighters!
My precious fighters!
The long-awaited magnificent raising of the curtain,
Opening the new, grand stage has begun;
Beneath the banner of the dignity of man,
The bell heralds the arrival of a new renaissance
Resounding high and loud.

Ah, have thirty years passed
Since one youth arrived
In this new world where
But few embraced the Mystic Law?
Sharing a karmic bond
He burned with the mission
To cultivate and to accomplish
The noble task of kosen-rufu.

The bold youths, with many others,
Stood up and forged on along the treacherous road
To bravely open the way for the Mystic Law.
And together did they cherish
Deep down within
The fervent pledge
To be the soil of America.

To respond to the brave
Yet desperate fight of my dear friends,
In autumn of 1960
Did I mark the first step of my travel for peace
On this great land of America - 
The world in small scale;
The melting pot of diversified races,
And twenty-seven years have passed since.

At a loss in this vast and extensive foreign land,
Ailing in solitude
And weeping from the karmic tribulations of life
Were my friends and not a few were they.
So, to light the flame of courage and happiness
In their darksome and depressed hearts,
I summoned my strength to its last ounce
And in pursuit of this end did I strive.

Moreover did I send
Another youth,
A youth whom I trained
To share the goal.

Time surely flies like an arrow,
Over a quarter of a century has flown by
And twenty times and more did I return to this land.

And now, flowers are blooming
In my friends' smiling faces
And small yet precious seeds of propagation
Have begun to sprout;
It is the pioneering fathers and mothers,
Mothers above all,
Who in sweat and tears and in joy and with hope,
Wrote the beginning history of kosen-rufu;
And today in this land stand hundreds of thousands of treasure towers."

Using passages from this poem, NSA General Director George M. Williams on April 20, 1987 placed a conference call to the organization's executive directors in each major U.S. city.  This was only eight days before the first proposed New Freedom Bell ceremony, but his phone call set everything in motion.  Soon, members in each part of the country were gearing up for the nationwide effort.

At the same time, the NSA staff in Los Angeles, working closely with General Director Williams, drafted a Declaration of Peace that would accompany the bell on its travels.  By the time the bell finally reached Philadelphia, some 300,000 people had affixed their signatures to this document.  In so doing, they affirmed their belief that there be ""no more Alamos, no more Pearl Harbors, no more Hiroshimas and no more war.""  They also pledged their effort ""to protect and guarantee the rights of all people in generations to come.""

Of course, it would have been a relatively simple matter just to take the New Freedom Bell to various cities across the country.  But to make each ceremony meaningful, the members of NSA had to work in their spare time to win the involvement of government officials, the local media and other groups that shared similar ideals.  In the end, their efforts proved successful.  Hardly a day went by without some government official issuing a proclamation and presiding over a New Freedom Bell ceremony.  And hardly a day went by when hundreds of American citizens did not show up for a chance to see and ring the bell.  All this - and only a few days to organize it all!

In ""Arise, the Sun of the Century,"" President Ikeda wrote:
Behold, at this moment,
The glorious sun rises,
Tinting the surface of the Rockies in vermilion,
Cherishing the great prairies of Colorado in its golden embrace,
Transforming the waters of the Mississippi into crimson,
Shedding the morning rays of hope
On the windows of Manhattan high-rises.

The New Freedom Bell passed through all those places on its journey.  It was witness to all the majesty and ordinariness of this vast country.  But its sound - and its symbology - never failed to find a common chord in the hearts of all citizens.   It, too, like the Liberty Bell before it, had become a rallying force for the cause of freedom for ""generations to come.""

Soka Gakkai International President Daisaku Ikeda speaks to NSA members on February 26, 1987 in Santa Monica, California, and dedicates to them the poem, 'Arise, the Sun of the Century,' which he had penned that very morning.  The poem gave inspiration to the New Freedom Trail sponsored by NSA, which brought the New Freedom Bell to some forty-four cities.

Arise, the Sun of the Century

I dedicate this poem on this auspicious start commemorating the thirtieth anniversary of the kosen-rufu movement in America.

America! Oh America!
Nurturing endless dreams
Of myriads of people,
Who aroused their frontier spirit,
You are the New World of rainbows,
You are the great land of freedom.

America! Oh Giant America!
Anxiety deepens as the century draws to a close.
You are the protagonist and producer
Of the drama of world history -
The drama of incessant change;
Your powerful vigor shall determine
The destiny of our precious oasis - 
Our spaceship Earth."

measured twenty-four feet on each
side.  An imposing replica of the
chandelier in Independence Hall
also was hung in the Spectrum.
Along the walls, imitation windows
were installed, and through them
peered three-dimensional busts of
the Founding Fathers.  All this
redecorating-- and recreating of
Independence Hall-- was accomplished
by the members of NSA,
working in their spare time.  It lent
an authentic atmosphere to the
modern-day gathering.
Learning of the New Freedom
Bell, U. S. Vice President George
Bush had written a letter of thanks
and congratulations to the members
of NSA, saying, ""Just as the

Liberty Bell is a symbol of the precious
freedoms embodied in the
Constitution, I believed that this exact
replica symbolizes your pledge
to protect and guarantee the rights
of all people in generations to
come.  The New Freedom Bell is a
step in rekindling the dreams of our
people for a great and peaceful
America.""
And indeed, the entire journey
of the New Freedom Bell, concluding
with the significant events in
Philadelphia on July 2, 3 and 4, was
a kind of rekindling--of the passion
of the NSA members, and of the
heroic and pioneering spirit of all
Americans that gave birth to the
United States and its Constitution.

1 The Liberty Bell which is on display
in the pavilion in front of Independence
Hall in Philadelphia is not, in fact, the
same bell that was shipped to that city
in 1752.  When the bell forged at the
Whitechapel Bell Foundry in London
was first raised at the Pennsylvania
State House (later Independence Hall),
it was ceremoniously rung.  After a clang
and a hum, it developed a crack.  It was
recast by Pass and Stow of Philadelphia,
but this recast bell, evidently done with
the addition of too much copper, produced
only a ""bonk"" when it was rung.
So, it was again recast.  Its fatal, final
crack developed when it was rung to observe
the passing of Supreme Court
Chief Justice John Marshall in 1835.  Investigations
by metallurgists in recent
years have shown that the so-called
Great Bell suffered from an inherent
weakness that was only compounded by
the melting down and adding of other
metals in its subsequent recastings.  So,
technically the New Freedom Bell is an
exact replica of the Pennsylvania State

House Bell, which was twice recast (in
the same shape) before becoming the
Liberty Bell in 1776.

2 Fred W. Riggs, in ""A Neo-Institutional
Typology of Third World Politics,"" estimates
that thirty-four states (twenty-five
percent of all Third World countries)
survived as regimes, while only five
(fifteen percent) suffered coups.  Of the
forty-three (i.e., thirty-two percent of all
new states) that chose a parliamentary
system, thirteen of them (thirty percent)
lost power in coups.  The comparative
figure for presidential regimes is thirty-three
total adoptions, all of which 
suffered interludes of presidentially imposed
martial law accompanied by suspension
of the legislature, or episodes of
naked military rule.
Also pertinent is Samuel P. Huntington's
""The Change to Change, Modernization,
Development and Politics,""
which appeared in Vol. 3, No. 3 of Comparative
Politics.  So, too, is his ""Political
Development and Political Decay.""

The New Freedom Bell:  Chapter 2

Bell Celebrates
America's Heritage

As it made its way around the
nation, the New Freedom
Bell left a legacy of goodwill
and revived patriotic pride wherever
it went.  Young and old came to
ring it, and ringing it, they were
reminded of what makes the United
States special -- and indeed
great.  After all, the Liberty Bell itself
sits stoically in a building in
front of Philadelphia's Independence
Hall.  No one gets to ring it;
it is not taken on journeys anywhere.
The New Freedom Bell, cast
from the same mold as the original
of the Liberty Bell, thus became a
roving ambassador of Americanism,
celebrating the bicentennial of
the Constitution, but more, also
tugging at the heartstrings of
Americans everywhere.
NSA is a group that is used to
doing things in a big way, and on a
moment's notice.  Since 1986, when
it held its annual nationwide meeting
in New York, NSA had set its
sights on gathering in Philadelphia
in 1987 for the July 4th holiday, and
to celebrate the bicentennial of the
U.S. Constitution in the city where

it was drafted and signed.  The New
Freedom Bell was ordered from the
Whitechapel Foundry as a gift to
present to the City of Philadelphia
in honor of the occasion.  The idea
for a New Freedom Trail -- to actually
take the bell on a nationwide
tour and let people see it and ring
it -- did not come about until April
1987, only three months before the
scheduled Philadelphia general
meeting.
The decision to send the bell on
its 11,500-mile journey sprang in
large part from a meeting which
happened in Los Angeles in February.
While visiting the United 
States in 1987, SGI President
Daisaku Ikeda penned a poem for
the members of NSA and personally
presented it at an assembly on
February 26.  He entitled his poem,
""Arise, the Sun of the Century,"" to
signify the United States's important
and indeed pivotal place on
the world stage.  The poem's words
called out to all the members of 
NSA to continue their efforts to
achieve what is called kosen-rufu

Tom Foglietta, both dressed as
colonial patriots, as was everyone 
else, rang the bell ""high and loud.""
Two distinguished speakers
were on hand: Archibald Cox, Carl
M. Loeb Professor Emeritus at Harvard
University, and John Montgomery,
Ford Foundation Professor
of International Studies at Harvard
University. Professor Cox spoke on
""The Constitutional Adventure""
and Professor Montgomery on
""Constitutional Conventions.""
Professor Cox noted that George
Washington had called the drafting
and signing of the Constitution ""a
miracle,"" and added:
""It seems an even greater miracle
that the instrument written two
hundred years ago still serves so
well today, with only the early addition
of the Bill of Rights and a 
very few other important changes.
Everything has changed, except 
the Constitution. The population of 
greater Philadelphia is almost as
large as the population of the 
whole United States when the Constitution
was signed. Communication
is instant. Markets are
nationwide. A few words cannot
summarize the scientific discoveries,
technological and economic
revolutions, and the rise in the
standard of living. Compare the single
blacksmith at his forge with the
armies of skilled men in gigantic
mills of the U.S. Steel Corporation.
In other lands, since 1787, scores of
written constitutions have been 
written and thrown on the junk
pile of history. Yet the Constitution
of the United States still provides
not only the outline of the structure,
powers and limits of government
but also the spiritual lodestar
to which Americans turn.""

Professor Montgomery was
even more specific when he said:
""We have tracked the political 
histories of one-hundred-ten new
states that emerged in the postwar
era.2 Thirty-four states (twenty-five
percent of all Third World
countries) opted for one-party regimes
when they achieved independence.
Twenty-nine of those
thirty-four survived as regimes (an
eighty-five percent record). Only
five of them suffered coups. From
this, it would appear that if you
want to establish a stable country,
you should set up a one-party state.
But stability isn't everything. A
state means a no-constitution state,
with limited capacity for protecting
the people from the government.
""About a third adopted the
parliamentary system. Of the forty-three
that adopted the British system,
thirteen of their governments
lost power during a coup. That
means to say, only seventy percent
of them survived.
""About a third adopted the
presidential system. Of the thirty-three
 that did so, you find the worst
record of all: all of them suffered
interludes of presidentially imposed
martial law accompanied by
a suspension of the legislature for
episodes of makeshift military rule.
""In a word, other people  have
constitutional worries that are far
more serious than ours. We must
not forget them. Political history
has not been kind to them. We can
correct most of the evils of our system.
We will not be able to correct
all of them, and I guess I'm kind of
glad about that, because it will give
us something to work for.""
In his address, NSA General 
Director Williams brought it all
home for members who are, after
6

all, practitioners of true Buddhism
who consider it their mission to secure
peace and happiness for the 
whole world. He observed and urged:
""How to establish security
within one's family, the nation and 
throughout the world is a most urgent
issue today. It is no different 
from two hundred years ago, when
America struggled for its independence.
It will also be no different 
two hundred years from now, as we
continue our quest for individual 
happiness and global peace. Seven
hundred years ago, Nichiren Daishonin
proclaimed that the key to
true human happiness and world
peace exists within oneself. In 
other words, through individual
human revolution, or self-
motivated self-change we can become
beautiful Americans and, at 
the same time, America and the
world will become beautiful.
""Through the joyful practice of
true Buddhism in our daily lives,
and showing great actual proof of 
our growth in society, let's build a 
'city upon a hill' from sea to shining
sea, from Alaska down to the 
Gulf of Mexico, and even across the
Pacific Ocean. The eyes of the nation
and the world are definitely 
turning toward us.""

proceedings of 1787. It rose

been cast as the Pennsylvania State 
House Bell 1752 by the Whitechapel 
Bell Foundry in London. In 
1976, the new Freedom Bell was 
forged in the same Whitechapel 
mold with the same wording as the 
original Liberty Bell. NSA acquired 
it, along with a certificate of 
authenticity, in 1986, it was 
stored in NSA's Philadelphia Community 
Center until April 26, 1987, 
when it was placed on its traveling 
trailer-platform and trucked 
ceremoniously to Massachusetts. 
At Concord, where the famous, 
""shot heard around the world"" was 
fired signaling the colonists' 
resolve to be free, snow fell as the 
first New Freedom Bell ceremony 
was held. By the time the bell 
reached Philadelphia, some two-and-a-half 
months later it was 
summer and blazing hot.
Throughout its history, the 
famed Liberty Bell has been used as 
a symbol for all movements for 
freedom. First, of course it rang 
out to honor and proclaim the 
Declaration of Independence. 
Later, it was used symbolically for 
the movement to abolish slavery, 
and still later,  for women's suffrage. 
It may be famous, in a simple sort 
of way, for the crack it developed 
sometime in the 19th century, but 
historically, its image rallied people 
to heroic causes; and for that is has 
become almost a sacred object.
The New Freedom Bell is also a 
symbol. Recognized by the Commission 
on the Bicentennial of the 
U.S. Constitution , headed by former 
Supreme Court Chief Justice 
Warren Burger, it served as the 
foremost national effort to reawaken 
the American people to the 
meaning and preciousness of the 
4
U.S. Constitution. Accompanying it 
was a Declaration of Peace, signed 
by the members of the NSA and by 
citizens everywhere who came out 
to ring it. This proclamation spoke 
eloquently to America's mission 
""to secure eternal peace and freedom 
in this world.""
NSA is part of a larger worldwide 
organization known as the 
SGI, or Soka Gakkai International, 
an umbrella organization for all 
Buddhist lay organizations. Though 
each member nation is free to pursue 
its own agenda, all adhere to 
the same principles set down by Nichiren 
Daishonin, the founder of 
orthodox Buddhism, which is now 
known as the Nichiren Shoshu 
school. The foremost principle of 
this teaching is the inviolable dignity 
of human life. NSA, following 
the lead of the SGI and its president, 
Daisaku Ikeda, has long been 
active culturally and civically, 
promoting the cause of human dignity. 
Indeed, a poem dedicated to 
NSA and its members earlier in 
1987 by SGI President Ikeda had 
given inspiration to the New Freedom 
Bell movement. In that poem, 
he wrote, in part:

Courageous fighters for 
peace,
Raise the anchor! It is time 
to embark!
Toll the bell high and loud,
again and again!
It is the bell of departure!
It is the bell of daybreak!
It is the bell of happiness!

NSA General Director Williams 
has always urged the members to be 
model citizens, to uphold high ideals 
and to dedicate their lives to the 
principles that made America great.

MESSAGE FOR THE PARTICIPANTS OF NSA NEW FREEDOM BELL TOUR:

Congratulations on the very significant nationwide 
tour of the New Freedom Bell, which NSA is sponsoring in 
commemoration of the upcoming 200 year anniversary of our 
country's Constitution. 

Just as the Liberty Bell is a symbol of the 
precious freedoms embodied in the Constitution, I believe 
that this exact replica symbolizes your pledge to protect 
and guarantee the rights of all people in generations to 
come. The New Freedom Bell is a step in rekindling the 
dreams of our people for a great and peaceful America.

Sincerely,
George Bush



United States Vice President George Bush, who first became acquainted with 
NSA during the Columbus Day Parade in Chicago in 1986, sent a letter of congratulations 
to the members of NSA when he learned of the New Freedom Bell. 
His letter was among nearly 130 such messages and official proclamations that 
praised the New Freedom Bell movement.

Indeed, many of the activities he 
himself sponsors carry themes 
from America's past. He has led 
youthful outings to Valley Forge- 
where the mettle of the Continental 
Army under George Washington 
was tested and unity forged- 
to apply historic lessons to the challenges 
of today. When the bicentennial 
of the nation approached, he led 
the members in 1975 to Hawaii, 
chosen as a national symbol because 
it was the 50th state, and then to the 
historic cities of the Revolutionary 
period in 1976, to celebrate all that 
is great about the country. In Honolulu, 
the members built a waterborne 
stage and floated it off the 
beach at Waikiki, where a live performance 
was held before 50,000 
enthralled spectators to recall 
the nation's history in song and dance. 

The next year, bicentennial celebrations- 
parades, ballpark shows, 
musical events and many other festivities- 
were staged in the three 
bicentennial cities of Boston, New 
York and Philadelphia. Some one 
million people lined the Avenue of 
the Americas in Manhattan to view 
NSA's nighttime July 4th parade.  
In 1987, to cap the New Freedom 
Bell journey, NSA members 
again gathered in Philadelphia. 
They participated in the Freedom 
Festival Parade and on July 4th, 
they help their own assembly at the 
Spectrum, where the Philadelphia 
Flyers and 76ers play. To honor the 
bicentennial of the Constitution, 
the New Freedom Bell was rung to 
begin the proceedings. Mayor 
Goode was again on hand, praising 
the members for the dedication

provided this special replica at the request of NSA.  Moulded to our old style 
profile with exact copy lettering and cast in the same pit as the original, this replica 
will be presented by NSA to the City of Philadelphia as a gesture and lasting monument 
to the principles of freedom, dignity and peace represented by your City and by the 
Founding Fathers of your country.

This reproduction Liberty Bell is equipped with a special electric ringing device so 
that it may ring its clear and resonant sounds of freedom throughout the land, just as
the original once did.  We sincerely hope that this new Liberty Bell will find a 
lasting home in your City and in the hearts of people everywhere who yearn, more than 
anything else, for true peace, freedom and brotherhood on Earth.

Director George M. Williams the pit used for casting the bell.

Pacific Northwest, then down the 
West Coast, through the Sun Belt 
and the South, and on to Washington, 
D.C. From the U.S. Capital, it 
was brought through Delaware and 
New Jersey and finally over the 
Benjamin Franklin Bridge into Philadelphia. 
On the bridge, hundreds 
of NSA members lined the sides, 
holding high U.S. flags. Rain poured 
down, but the procession moved 
steadily on. As the bell crossed the 
bridge and neared the Philadelphia 
Museum of Art, where a ceremony 
would be held, the daylong downpour 
abruptly halted. The skies 
cleared, and the sun bathed the 
bell in its radiant light. The New 
Freedom Bell had come home.
     The next evening, following the 
parade, NSA General Director 

George M. Williams, on behalf of all 
the members, presented the bell to 
Philadelphia Mayor W. Wilson Goode.
     Along its route, known as the 
New Freedom Trail, the bell had 
drawn hundreds of thousands of 
citizens, and each was afforded the 
opportunity to ring it. Its crystal-clear 
and resonant sound could be 
heard in parks, town hall plazas, 
shopping malls and public gathering 
places across the country. 
Mayors and other city, county and 
state official hailed its arrival, attended 
ceremonies to ring this replica 
Liberty Bell, and proclaimed 
New Freedom Bell Day. Some 129 
proclamations and letters of 
congratulations from public officials 
accompanied the bell on its 44-city,

heart and soul of America.

General Director Williams visited the historic foundry during June 1987 
with a group of NSA members. It was here that he and the members met the 
Whitechapel owner, William A. Hughes, and saw the pit where the Freedom 
Bell was cast, which was the same one used for the Liberty Bell.

So this book is both a record of all your efforts and a rallying point for
your continued efforts into the future. We wish to dedicate this book to
President Ikeda, whose guidance has propelled our advancement over the 
years. It is also our gift to the public, so that they may share in what we 
accomplished with great pride during 1987.
As we enter 1988, let's each of us make a new resolution to continue
our march toward the realization of lasting peace, happiness and security

The New Freedom Bell: Chapter 1
'Bell of Departure, 
Bell of Happiness'

On September 17, 1987, the 
nation celebrated the signing 
of the United States 
Constitution. A festive parade
made its way to Independence
Hall, where the world's oldest living 
document of democracy had
been signed two hundred years to
the day earlier. Along the way, some
half a million spectators lined the 
streets. From a platform in front of 
Independence Hall the President of
the United States, Ronald Reagan, 
addressed the nation as the parade 
paused. When the speech ended
and the parade resumed, three 
floats went by. On one of those, the 
centerpiece of the entire parade, 
stood a replica of the original of the 
Liberty Bell 1, which had rung out to
honor independence in 1776 and 
many times later. That replica was
named the New Freedom Bell, and 
it was a gift from NSA, a nationwide 
lay people's organization of
believers in Nichiren Daishonin's 
Buddhism. 
The New Freedom Bell had 
been given to the City of Philadelphia 
at the conclusion of that

chapel Bell Foundry in London, where

Foreword

I would like to extend my thanks to all the members of NSA who made
the journey of the New Freedom Bell along the New Freedom Trail such
a resounding success.  Congratulations to all of you. This new book,
which has been a joint effort of many, many people, is a tribute to that jour-
ney, as well as a lasting memory of a big part of NSA's movement in 1987.
In his poem, ""Arise, the Sun of the Century,"" SGI President Daisaku Ike-
da inspired all of us to begin the next leg of our journey toward kosen-rufu
here in America when he wrote:
Let us aim for the summit of eternal happiness in the new
century,
Shining beyond the vast prairies.
This day, this very morning,
With great pride and conviction
Have we boldly launched
On a brand new voyage.
As a consequence, we launched the New Freedom Bell on its journey
this past April 28, the very historic 734th anniversary of the founding of 
Nichiren Daishonin's true Buddhism.  Most significantly, the first ceremony
was held in Concord, Massachusetts, where the ""shot heard round the
world"" rallied the colonists to their cause of independence, resulting in 
the Declaration of Independence one year later, and eleven years after that,
the drafting and signing of the United States Constitution.
Indeed, our New Freedom Trail was the most significant event held na-
tionwide to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the Constitution, which we
observed throughout 1987.  When the President of the United States jour-
neyed to Philadelphia on September 17 to mark the signing of the Consti-
tution two hundred years earlier, it was the New Freedom Bell which served
as the focal point of the parade that day.  As President Ronald Reagan ad-
dressed the United States, the New Freedom Bell rested in front of him on
a float.
The New Freedom Trail and its overwhelming success are a tribute to
how much NSA has grown and how much the members of NSA have de-
veloped their capabilities.  As a result of everyone's effort, more than 
300,000 American citizens were able to ring the New Freedom Bell and sign
the Declaration of Peace accompanying it.  This is truly a magnificent
achievement.

And About the Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Inc.

A Living Memorial To The Drum Major for Justice
The institution that honors Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. is keeping his dream and philosophy alive.

The Freedom Hall Complex forms a complete rectangle around Dr. King's elevated marble crypt which is situated in the water that fills a 276-foot-long reflecting pool.  The Eternal Flame is positioned in front of the entombment area and the arch-covered Freedom Walkway runs parallel to the pool.  A Chapel of All Faiths sits at one end of the Complex, and the other end is occupied by the three-story Administration, Programs and Archives Building which houses the administrative offices, and exhibition hall and the King Library and Archives.  There also is Freedom Hall, an international conference center which has a conference hall, six meeting rooms, a gift shop, a 251-seat auditorium and a 90-seat film screening room.

When the Center's $8.5 million Freedom Hall Complex officially opened its doors on January 15, 1982 (the 53rd anniversary of Dr. King's birth), it marked the fulfillment of a dream that Mrs. Coretta Scott King had struggled to make come true.

Since that time, the Center has been the focal point of the national effort to keep the King Dream alive.  Under the leadership and presidency of Mrs. King, the Center has sponsored local and national programs and has organized the most extensive collection of King memorabilia in the world.  It has also enshrined the King legacy in a spectacular physical context that attracts more than 500,000 visitors a year.

During the past year, some of those contributors have had to tighten their purse strings because of galloping inflation and unemployment rates, but there are others who apparently have had second thoughts about donating after they visited the Freedom Hall Complex.  ""There are many people who probably would contribute but when they see this facility, they think we don't need their assistance,"" says Executive Vice President Lloyd Davis.  ""The Center is suffering from the illusion that it is heavily endowed.  That is very far from the truth."""

CENTER FOR NONVIOLENT SOCIAL CHANGE INC.

Education and training in Nonviolence -
Heart and Soul of the King Center

The Scholars Internship Program, in
its eighth year, has trained over 100
college and graduate students from the
U.S. and abroad in the history, philosophy
and methods on Nonviolence.
Students serve as King Center interns
according to their own career goals and
interests.  1983 marks the first anniversary
of the King Center's Intern
Alumni Association.

Workshops on Nonviolence are
rapidly making the King Center an
institution of national acclaim.  The
annual Summer Institute on Nonviolence,
sponsored by with the National
Education Association, trained more
than 200 educators in methods for 
bringing the message of Nonviolence to
their home communities.  The King
Center Instructors gave intensive 3 1/2 day
nonviolence workshops in six cities,
ninvolving 225 people.  The Center also
recently completed the first phase of
training for officials of the Southeastern
District of the American Lutheran
Church and the American Postal Workers.

The Voter Education Program, is
based on the belief that power at the
ballot box is a valuable tool for correcting
injustice.  Over 60 people completed a
training program for deputy voter registrars.
The King Center's City-Wide
Coalition to Register and get out the
vote, was credited with increasing the
voter turnout in Atlanta during the last 
two elections.  The Coalition also helped
persuade the U.S. Justice Department to
disallow law which would have made
identificatin more restricted and reduced
the number of assistants for handicapped
persons and senior citizens at the polls.

The Early Learning Center teaches
children about love, sharing and self
respect with a curriculum in Non-violence.
Some 20 youngsters participated
in a graduation ceremony at
Freedom Hall last June.

A large part of the King Center's
resources are devoted to teaching the
skills necessary to furthering nonviolent
methods of social change.  From the Early
Learning Center to the voter registration
program.  The King Center passed the
message of love and peace to more people
in 1982 than ever before.

The Basic Skills Academy teaches
basic reading and writing skills to inner
city enemployed and underemployed
youths and adults.  The King Center
believes it is essential for all people to
have the tools for self-support and self-respect.
Other communities are modeling
their own basic skills programs after The
King Center's.

The Youth Employment/Community
Improvement Program, funded by the
U.S. Department of Labor, has generated
$40,000 in wages for low income youths.
Over 100 young people have worked in
community service projects for the
elderly and handicapped and have
received Nonviolence training and career
counseling.

The King Library and Archives

Since its reopening on October 8, 1981
the King Library and Archives has
assisted in more than 5,000 research
projects including three new manor
biographies on Dr. King.  Scholars
around the country are praising the
Archives.  In the acknowledgements of
his new biography of Martin Luther
King, Jr., ""Let The Trumpet Sound"",
award-winning historian Stephen Oats
called The King Archives, ""...one of the
most efficient-organized archives I have
ever had the pleasure of working
through... The King Center is now the 
foremost library in the United States for
the study of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr
and the Civil Rights Movement.""

Montgomery, Alabama, and lived there all of his life except 
during the period when he attended high school in Tennessee 
and law school in Ohio.  He received a B. S. degree 
from Alabama State University in 1951, and a J. D. degree 
from Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio in 
1954.  In addition to his profession as a lawyer, he is an 
ordained minister of the Church of Christ.  As an attorney, he 
is the senior member of the law firm Gray, Langford, Sapp, 
Davis, and McGowan with offices in Montgomery and 
Tuskegee, Alabama.  He is qualified to practice before the 
following courts: the Supreme Court of Ohio (1954), 
Supreme Court of Alabama (1955), U. S. District Court for 
the Middle District of Alabama (1955), Supreme Court of the 
United States (1956), U. S. Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit 
(1958), U. S. District Court for the Northern District, Alabama 
(1963), U. S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth and Eleventh 
Circuit (1968 & 1982) and Tax Court (1968).

Some of the honors and awards he has received are: The Constitutional Law Award, Civil Liberties 
Union of Alabama, Distinguished Alumni Award, Alabama State University First Annual Equal 
Justice Award, National Bar Association, Certificate of Appreciation, University of Alabama Law 
Center, Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial ""Drum Major's"" Award, Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference, Alabama Lawyers Association Special Award, Presidential Award, National Bar 
Association, and President, National Bar Association, 1985-86.

These are a few of the selected cases handled by attorney Gray:

a) CITY OF MONTGOMERY VS. ROSA PARKS - 36 Ala. App. 681, 92 So. 2 d 683, (1957).  The city 
of Montgomery prosecuted Mrs. Rosa Parks for refusing to relinquish her seat on the city bus to a white 
man.  This incident triggered the Montgomery, Alabama Bus Protest of 1955-56.

b) M. L. King, Jr. v. STATE OF ALABAMA, 39 Ala. App. 167, 98, So. 2 d 443 (1957).  These cases 
were on the part of the local officials in Montgomery, Alabama to stop the Bus Protest.  These ministers 
were charged with violating the Alabama Anti-Boycott Statute.  The case was ultimately dismissed.

c) VIVIAN MALONE v. DEAN OF ADMISSIONS, UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA.  This cased opened 
the door for Negroes to attend the University of Alabama in spite of Governor Wallace's famous 
school door stand.

d) In addition to these cases, he has represented the Freedom Marchers in the State of Alabama, 
Freedom Walkers, Freedom Riders, obtained injunctions permitting the Selma to Montgomery March, 
including the representation of several professors from Wesleyan University and Dr. Coffin, Chaplin

On Thursday evening, December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks said No -- and set of a groundswell of resistance to racial injustice which was to surge far beyond Montgomery, Alabama, and which pulses still in the turbulence of 1985.

On a Montgomery city bus in 1955, Jim Crow law was clear: you sat in the ""Colored Section,"" if you were black, and you gave up your seat there too, to a white person, when the ""Whites Only"" seats had filled up.  You stood in the aisle in the back.  As a visible symbol of the accepted, institutionalized inequality of the races in the everyday life of the South as you'd want to find.

But Rosa Parks was tired on December 1st, tired from a heavy day in the downtown department store where she worked as a tailor's assistant in men's alterations, more deeply tired of the everyday humiliations and injustice to which black people were subject.  When two white men got on the full bus and the driver yelled, ""Niggers move back,"" she sat where she was.

Confronting the whole power structure of white society in the person of the angry bus driver and two policemen he called to arrest her, Rosa Parks was on her own, one woman spontaneously standing up for the simplest dignity of the human person by quietly insisting on her right to sit down.  But in another sense, of course, she was not alone.  Behind her, though she could not have known it for sure at that moment, was a whole people on the move, ready to organize, ready to stand firm with her.

When in custody, she was not permitted her one telephone call, despite many requests, until she had been fully processed, a procedure that took several hours.  Her call was to her other, who anxiously asked about her physical condition, ""was she hurt, had she been beaten""; her reply to both was No.  She then talked to her husband Raymond, who told her he would be there immediately.

Almost at the same time, a lady on the bus who recognized Mrs. Parks went to Mrs. Bertha Butler, a mutual friend, to relate the incident.  Mrs. Butler went to the home of Mr. E.D. Nixon, head of the Montgomery NAACP to tell him.  However, he was not home and his wife had to locate him.

When Mr. Nixon heard the news, he immediately telephoned the jail, but no information was released to him.  He then called Clifford Durr, a white attorney, who was given the information regarding her arrest.  Attorney Durr, his wife Virginia Durr and Mr. Nixon went to the jail and obtained Parks' release.  The strategy mapped out that night was a paradigm of the course the civil rights movement was to take.

They would take the struggle to both the courts and the streets.  With Durr as her attorney, Rosa Parks would challenge the constitutionality of the Alabama state law of bus segregation; a fight was to make its way up to the United States Supreme Court.  Nixon proposed a one-day protest boycott of the city's buses by the black community on Monday.  With Rosa Parks as their model, maybe a fair number of people would say No too.  Activists worked urgently through the weekend to organize it, choosing as a leader a young minister with no previous record of social activism, but a galvanizing style in the pulpit: Martin Luther King, Jr.  On Friday evening Mrs. Parks talked to a serious and concerned group at his Dexter Avenue Baptist Church.  Maybe it would work.

The one-day boycott lasted for 381 days.  Ninety-Five percent of Montgomery's blacks stayed off the buses.  People walked to work, arranged car pools, improvised taxis.  Mrs. Parks, fired from the department store, was at work setting up rides.  A sense of unity and of organization took hold in those first days and grew beyond anyone's initial hopes.  The court victory came in November, 1956, and gave it further impetus.  One woman's spontaneous ""sit-in"" grew into a phenomenal movement that is far from over; millions of people working for an end to racism in all its pervasive and cruelly persistent forms.

Born in Tuskegee, Alabama in 1913, Rosa Parks spent part of her childhood in rural Pine Level, on the farm of her grandparents, who had been slaves.  Moving to Montgomery at age eleven, she attended the Montgomery Industrial School for Girls.  Her husband, Raymond, an early activist in behalf of the Scottsboro Boys, worked alongside her in the NAACP, which she joined in 1943.  When she refused to give up her seat, she was also the energetic secretary of the Montgomery branch of the NAACP and its Director of Youth Activities; busy that very week with preparations for a major youth conference.

She and her husband had been engaged in the struggle for basic civil rights long before there were great numbers to join them or to take note of their determined often dangerous work, long before the landmark court cases and the televised marches and the organized sit-ins.

The year 1956 was a hard one for Rosa Parks and her family.  As the constitutional challenge struggled through the courts and the boycott bumped on through the streets, the woman who was known to have started it all became a target of hatred as deep as the respect and gratitude she inspired.  She and her husband lost their jobs.  There were repeated threats on her life.  She was arrested again.

The following year the Parks moved to Detroit, where she has worked for many years as assistant to Representative John Conyers of Michigan.  The ""mother of the modern freedom movement,"" who feels a special empathy with the young and has an abiding faith in their energy as a force for change, has been a tireless speaker at schools and colleges all over the country.  ""This is a lifetime of work,"" she commented recently, not just the few moments on the bus that everyone remembers.

In evitably we remember the drama of the Montgomery bus and all it has come to symbolize, but is is for the courage and conviction, the quiet persistence of a lifetime that we honor Rosa Parks."

Gray
Mr. Fred Gray, the esteemed Civil Rights Lawyer, was 
born in Montgomery, Alabama, and lived there all of his 
life except during the period when he attended high 
school in Tennessee and law school in Ohio. He 
received a B.S. degree from Alabama State University
 in 1951, and a J.D. degree from Case Western Reserve 
University, Cleveland, Ohio in 1954. In addition to his 
profession as a lawyer, he is an ordained minister of the 
Church of Christ. As an attorney, he is the senior 
member of the law firm Gray, Langford, Sapp, Davis and McGown with offices in 
Montgomery and Tuskegee, Alabama. He is qualified to practice before the following 
courts: the Supreme Court of Ohio 1954, Supreme Court of Alabama 1954, U.S. 
District Court of the Middle District of Alabama 1955, Supreme Court of the United
States 1956, U.S. Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit 1958, U.S. District Court for the 
Northern District, Alabama 1963, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth and Eleventh
Circuit 1968 and 1982 and Tax Court 1968. 

These are a few of the selected cases handled by attorney Gray: 

a) City of Montgomery v. Rosa Parks - 36 Ala. App. 681, 92 So. 2d 683, (1957). 
The city of Montgomery prosecuted Mrs. Rosa Parks for refusing to relinquish her 
seat on the city bus to a white man. The incident triggered the Montgomery, 
Alabama Bus Protest of 1955-56. 
b) M. L. King, Jr. v. State of Alabama, 39 Ala. App. 167, 98 So. 2d 443 (1957). 
These cases were on the part of the local officials in Montgomery, Alabama to stop 
the Bus Protest. These ministers were charged with violating the Alabama Anti-
Boycott Statute. The case was ultimately dismissed. 
c) Vivian Malone v. Dean of Admissions, University of Alabama. 
This case opened the door for Negroes to attend the University of Alabama in spite
of Governor Wallace's famous school door stand. 
d) In addition to these cases, he has represented the Freedom Marchers in the 
State of Alabama, Freedom Walkers, Freedom Riders, obtained injunctions
permitting the Selma to Montgomery March, including the representation of
several professors from Wesleyan University and Dr. Coffin, Chaplin of Yale 
University.

Martin
Luther
King, III
Martin Luther King, III was born in Montgomery,
Alabama the second oldest of four children born to Dr.
Martin Luther King, Jr. and Mrs. Coretta Scott King.
He was nurtured in an environment deeply committed
to the struggle for human rights and the realization of a
nonviolent society. Martin, III has naturally assimilated
those values.

Mr. King is a graduate of Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia where he majored in

During the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln, upon being introduced to 
Harriet Beecher Stowe, author of the anti-slavery novel ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"", is 
alleged to have called the author the ""little lady"" who caused the Civil War. We know
that this fratricidal war brought an end to slavery in the U.S. However, Lincoln's 
statement was not accusatory or blaming but one full of understanding that this 
nation's accursed stain would now be righted albeit by a tragic war. 

Rosa Parks can be likened to Harriet Beecher Stowe since the former's indefatig-
able courage would lead to one of the greatest reform movements of the twentieth
century — the Civil Rights Movement. 

Fred D. Gray, whom Martin Luther King, Jr. describes as the brilliant young Negro 
who later became the chief counsel for the protest movement, would defend both Mrs. 
Parks and the Montgomery Improvement Association in both state and federal courts
in cases arising from the Montgomery bus boycott. Through Attorney Gray's actions in this and other cases, the U.S. Supreme Court would issue decisions which would
ultimately strike a blow at the segregationist policies of our nation.

Our third guest speaker, Martin Luther King, the 3rd can be seen as a symbol of his father's prophetic March On Washington speech. On that warm August afternoon in 
1963, Martin Luther King, Jr. predicted that his ""four little children would someday 
live in a nation where they would not be judged by the color of the skin but by the 
content of their character."" Twenty-three years would find his eldest son being 
elected Commissioner of Fulton County in Atlanta, Georgia thus fulfilling a part of his 
father's ""dream.""

Rosa Louise Parks

Mrs. Parks was born on February 4, 1913 in Tuskegee, Alabama. 
Her family moved to Montgomery and she attended the Mont-
gomery Industrial School for girls where among others, she learn-
ed the art of dressmaking. In 1931, she married Raymond Parks. 
They were both interested and active in voter registration and
other civil rights pursuits long before it was an activity generally
engaged in by others. 

Mr. Parks was an early activate in the effort to free the 'Scottsboro
Boys' a celebrated case in the 1930's. They both worked on
NAACP programs. Mrs. Parks was secretary of the Montgomery 
branch and also the director of Youth Activities. She was pre-
paring for a major Conference of Youth at the time of her arrest.

Subsequent to the arrest of Rosa Parks, the Black people of
Montgomery and sympathisers of other races organized and
promoted a boycott of the city bus line that lasted more than 300
days. Contingent with the protest in Montgomery, others took 
shape in locations throughout the south. The spread actually
reached areas in the north, east and west as well. They took form
as sit-ins, eat-ins, swim-ins and like causes. In many cases 'die-
hard' resisters who wanted a continuance of the status-quo cre-
ated violent confrontations. However the theme of the movement
of ""non-violence"" as enunciated by Dr. Martin Luther King was the 
general practice of the Black protestors. 

A quiet exemplification of courage, dignity and determination, 
Rosa Parks will ever be a symbol of all Americans' will to be and to 
remain free."

New Freedom Bell, officiated by Mayor Dianne Feinstein.

June 6, San Francisco, California:
In the mist of a Northern California
morning, the New Freedom
Bell made a ceremonial crossing of
the Golden Gate Bridge.  More than
1,500 NSA members lined the
famed suspension bridge to greet
the bell as it made its way into the
""city by the bay,"" escorted by California
Highway Patrol cars.
The weekend before, more than
800,000 people had gathered on
the bridge to celebrate the fiftieth
anniversary of the structure built
during the height of the Great
Depression.  That event, which at
times seemed to threaten the collapse
of the bridge itself, was widely
covered by national news media.
But today's more sparsely attended
ceremony actually carried more
significance than the event of the
weekend before.  The previous
event had looked backwards; this

one presaged a glorious future for
America and for the world.
An ABC-TV news reporter, however,
did notice what was happening.
Driving to work, Carol Ivey saw
the procession and stopped to
phone her office for a video crew.
By the time the crew arrived, the
bell was nearing South Vista Point.
She was able to interview the NSA
members involved, and that evening
the coverage appeared on channel 7.
The New Freedom Bell was then
taken to Marriott's Great America
theme park in Santa Clara where
thousands of people were able to
ring it.
June 7, San Francisco, California:
Some 5,000 people showed
up as the bell was displayed for 
ringing in Union Square, heart of
the city.
June 8, San Francisco, California:
Mayor Dianne Feinstein herself

50

confidently and boldly marched
out to lead the ceremony today at
City Hall Plaza. Carrying a proclamation
declaring ""NSA Freedom
Day,"" she strode to the podium and
said: ""You know the Liberty Bell
says so much, and we take so much
for granted. One of the things I'm
constantly reminded of is how special
it is that we live in a democracy.
You know, most of the people of
the world don't know a democracy.""
She went on to read the proclamation,
which stated, in part,
""NSA has made valuable contributions
to the positive development
of young people in San Francisco
and throughout the United States,
and its 'New Freedom Bell' is deeply
appreciated.""
In his remarks, Clinton W.
White, supervising justice of the
California State Court of Appeals,
said, ""I sense in this audience a certain
exuberance that, frankly,
[makes me feel] I guess I've grown
old.  There seems to be, as I look
into your smiling faces, an unnerving
feeling...It's good; it's good.""
That evening, the bell was
driven to the Tanforan Shopping
Center in San Bruno, near the San
Francisco International Airport,
where thousands more were able to
ring it.
June 9, Santa Barbara, California:
The bell was being driven
along the Grapevine, a lonely stretch
of highway, toward Los Angeles
when word was flashed over the CB
radios that an impromptu ceremony
had been scheduled in Santa Barbara,
miles back.  Already, the truck
carrying the trailer was so overheated
in the summer sun that the drivers
had to roll down the windows and
turn on the truck's heater to cool the
engine down. Temperatures in the

cabin swelled to more than 120
degrees.  The drivers changed course,
and a 4:00 p.m. ceremony was held
in the coastal resort with the attendance
of Mayor Sheila Lodge and
hundreds of local residents.
June 11, Los Angeles, California:
In the City of the Angels, so
named by the Spaniards who settled
it, the New Freedom Bell was posted
today in front of City Hall. A
veritable pantheon of city officials
attended the event: Mayor Tom
Bradley, Deputy Mayor Grace Davis,
District Attorney Ira Reiner, Council
members Robert Farrell, Gloria Molina
and John Ferraro, and Rita
Walters, president of the Los Angeles
School Board.
Beamed Mayor Bradley in opening 
the ceremony, ""When I heard
NSA was involved, I knew we would
have a great spectacle that would
travel all across this country."" The
mayor is well acquainted with NSA,
being a longstanding friend of General
Director Williams and having
met with SGI President Daisaku Ikeda
on several occasions.  He is a great
booster of the organization and its 
goals, and has even visited its headquarters
in Santa Monica, California,
to address the membership.
On this particular morning, he
was quite jovial, even chiding
Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn for
suggesting the New Freedom Bell remain
in his city.  It was the time of
the National Basketball Association 
championship, a battle between the
arch-rival Los Angeles Lakers and
Boston Celtics, and he didn't miss a
beat in getting in a dig that the
championship trophy would travel
soon to Los Angeles, just as the Freedom
Bell had.
The ceremony was held in the
park fronting the south wing of the

in front of the Capitol from 4:00 to
5:00 p.m.
June 2, Portland, Oregon: The
arrival of the New Freedom Bell
witnessed a week of overcast skies
changing into a cloudless spring day.
Terry Shrunk Plaza, across the
street from City Hall, played host to
the ceremony.  Presiding was Mayor
J.E. ""Bud"" Clark who, in ringing the
bell, gave out his locally famous cry
of ""Whoop, whoop!""
On the evening news following
the ceremony, an unnamed student
who had participated said, ""It
represents freedom, but without the
crack in it.""
Another spectator, Robert Cook,
remarked, ""I like this.  We need a rebirth
of patriotism in this country.""
In the evening, the bell was
moved to Tom McCall Waterfront
Park where many more Portlanders
were able to ring it.
June 3, Eugene, Oregon: The
New Freedom Bell was positioned in
front of the City Court House from
9:00 to 11:00 a.m. this morning to
bring the sounds of freedom to this
city.
June 5, Sacramento, California:
Mayor Anne Rudin proclaimed
this ""NSA Freedom Day"" as the
New Freedom Bell moved into the
state that gold created.  Positioned
near the State Capitol, the bell drew
a large crowd, including hundreds
and hundreds of schoolchildren and
visitors to the refurbished and ornate
capital building.
In a town where politics abound,
it was only fitting that the bell was
welcomed by varying groups of
legislators. In addition to Mayor
Rudin's declaration, the Sacramento
County Board of Supervisors
proclaimed ""Freedom Bell Day"" in
the county; a Congressional salute
was read into the Congressional
Record by Robert Matsui, member of
Congress, and the California State
Legislature jointly issued a resolution
declaring ""NSA Freedom Day""
in the area.
Chief U.S. District Judge
Lawrence K. Karlton addressed the
crowd, echoing U.S. Supreme Court
Justice Thurgood Marshall in calling
the original Constitution ""limited""
in that it did not extend its basic
freedoms to women or to black
slaves.  ""It is...true that this is one
of the most glorious documents in
the world...true that it is a document
from which we have had to
learn, to evolve,"" he said.
Judge Karlton was the first
Sacramentan to ring the bell, followed
by Vice Mayor Bill Smallman.
The crowd--which included, in
addition to the schoolchildren, soldiers,
musicians and computer engineers,
and people of all races and
origins--was united in its enthusiasm
for the bell and what it stood
for.
The bell ""symbolizes the effort to 
recreate America based on the true
spirit of the original Founding
Fathers,"" said Norris K. Oler.
""There's a lot of cynicism in this
country right now and this is sorely
needed.""
Imani Stover, a hair stylist, said
the bell ""symbolized fundamental
happiness and world peace.""
""All men have the right to be free
and be happy,"" Stover concluded.
One tourist who came up to ring
the bell said he had emigrated from
Hungary in 1955, and that ringing
the bell brought up all the emotions
of his past, filled with suffering, and
his present, filled with great promise
in a free country.

fought two centuries ago at Lexington
and Concord, followed by a parade
of American flags borne by
NSA members.
 As the snow continued to fall,
the bell was unveiled.  A professor 
of history from Northeastern University,
William Fowler, spoke of
the significance of the New Freedom
Bell and the event taking 
place that day.  He said:  ""It is altogether
fitting, then, that amidst
the. . .anniversary of our Constitution,
the supreme icon of our
Republic, that we should be unveiling
another icon, this bell, which is
symbolic, of course, of the bell in
Philadelphia, the bell that I hope. . .
will still be an icon for our generations
to come and whose sound will
ring out as proud and as strong and
as sweet with the sound of liberty as
her cousin does today.""
As the local NSA chorus sang
""America the Beautiful,"" State
Representative John Loring became
the first public official outside
Philadelphia to ring the New
Freedom Bell.  And as he did, he too
felt a transformation come over 
him:  ""I really felt goose bumps and
a tang of wonder.  Wonder of this 
great country."" 
As the Battle Monument and
the ""rude bridge"" stood silent vigil,
more than 400 people lined up to
ring the bell as snow continued to 
fall.  Among the ringers were the
Bedford Minutemen, a long line of
local schoolchildren, and even a
90-year-old woman who bravely
waited her turn despite the cold 
and the wet all around her.
When the time came to take the
bell from the site, Don Rood recalls
that the snow was several inches
deep and had hidden some of the
removable pieces of the platform
which has been stashed on the
ground, out of sight.  Then, it was
difficult navigating the truck-
platform from the site.  The small
asphalt road was obscured by snow,
and the only markers to guide the
way were bushes lining the sides.
Because many of the wooden
pieces of the platform assembly
were wet and swollen, not all of
them could be put back in place.  As
a consequence, the bell itself, not
fully secured, kept ringing every
time the vehicle jerked its way up
the snowbound incline and back to
the main road.  If it was an eerie experience, 
Rood recalls, it was also
one filled with the sounds of the
New Freedom Bell.
The next morning, the local
newspaper, the Middlesex News,
became the first publication to
cover the tour of the New Freedom
Bell with a story whose headline
proclaimed, ""Freedom Bell tolls
despite snowstorm.""  Spring
weather also return.
April 29, Boston, Massachusetts:
As a crowd of 10,000
gathered in the Boston Commons,
the nation's oldest park, to hear a
""son of Greek Immigrants named
Mike Dukakis"" declare his candidacy
for U.S. President, the bell was
set up nearby.  After Massachusetts
Governor Michael Dukakis concluded
his remarks, the New Freedom
Bell was rung again, ""high and
loud.""  Among those lining up to 
ring the bell were members of the
governor's family, Boston Mayor
Raymond Flynn (who remarked
that he would like to keep the bell
in Boston) and more than 300 members
of the state and local governments
led by Senate President 
William M. Bulger.
Said Mayor Flynn:  ""NSA's presentation

joining the local citizens for what
would become a scene recreated
throughout the many states:  A bell
on a platform, local civic leaders,
professors and practitioners of law
preparing to offer remarks on the 
beauty and durability of the constitutional
system, curious onlookers
assembling to see this replica
Liberty Bell, and then, after all the
dedications, remarks and comments,
a sound rings out, and then again,
again and again; somehow, this
sound transforms the ceremony
from the mundane to the spiritual.
Events surrounding this first
New Freedom Bell ceremony, 
however, had a uniqueness all their
own, not to be duplicated anywhere
else on the 11,500-mile journey
along the New Freedom Trail,
as this narrative of the bell's first 
seven stops shows.
April 28, Concord, Massachusetts:
Actually, the trail began two
days prior to Concord, back in Philadelphia.
In that city of its stateside 
origin, City Councilman Angel
Ortiz, bearing a letter from Mayor
W. Wilson Goode, came to see the
bell off at NSA's Philadelphia Community
Center, where he was to
ring it for the first time.  From that
day one, these two city officials, along
with many others, would be intimately
involved with the journey
of the New Freedom Bell.  NSA's 
center in Massachusetts is in
Boston, which is about thirty miles
from Concord.  The day of the bell's
arrival was a typical spring day.

As the new Freedom Bell is prepared for departure on April 26 at the NSA Philadelphia
Community Center, jubilant members ring it 'high and loud.'

24


The Bedford Minutemen, descendants of the original fighters for freedom, stand
guard as the first official New Freedom Bell ceremony is held in Concord, Massachusetts,
April 28.

So was the day before the ceremony,
but something about April 28 was
different.  It was cold and wintry,
and the ceremony was scheduled
for 6:00 p.m. to enable attendance
by local officials and citizens.
Two drivers who would escort
the Freedom Bell throughout its
journey had arrived just the evening
before-- Don Rood from San
Francisco and Joe Kubek from Dallas.
Don remembers spending the
evening outside a cabinetmaker's
shop where the final pieces of the
bell's ceremonial platform were being
put in place.  It was a race against
time, and the NSA volunteers once
again won.  There was another race,
however, and this one was against
ever-worsening weather conditions.
By the time the NSA volunteers
arrived on the afternoon of April
28 at Concord to start preparing the
site, it was raining.  The minute the
bell arrived, it started snowing, and
it did not let up until long after the
New Freedom Bell was rung for the 
last time.  But far from spoiling the
ceremony, the snow had a somewhat
mystical impact, shrouding
the proceedings in the wonder and
majesty of nature.
On a day that also marked the
734th anniversary of the founding
of Nichiren Shoshu Buddhism,
which is the teaching practiced by
the members of NSA, the New
Freedom Trail was thus commenced.
The ceremony opened with a 
procession of the Bedford Minutemen, descendants of those who

The original Pennsylvania State House Bell was forged at the Whitechapel
Bell Foundry in 1752 and shipped to Philadelphia the same
year.  Since it cracked almost immediately, it was recast at nearby
Pass and Stow.  On July 8, 1776, the day of the public reading of
the Declaration of Independence, it was proudly rung and given the
name Liberty Bell.  The bell cracked again when it was tolled in
1835 to mark the death of Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall.
The Liberty Bell has been taken on national tours in the past,
but it has rested in a special pavilion in front of Independence Hall
(formerly the Pennsylvania State House) since January 1, 1976,
where it was moved to mark the bicentennial of the United States.

The New Freedom Bell: Chapter 3

New Freedom
Trail Begins

By the rude bridge that arched the flood,
Their flag to April's breeze unfurled,
Here once the embattled farmers stood
And fired the shot heard round the world.
Ralph Waldo Emerson
""Concord Hymn""

The ""rude bridge"" in the above
stanza refers to a wooden
structure just outside the town
of Concord, Massachusetts, where
history was made on April 19, 1775.
By standing up to the British troops
who had set upon the town (and
the neighboring town of Lexington
as well), the local citizenry--""embattled
farmers"" and others--
opened a floodgate of democratic
forces that would eventually engulf
the greatest empire of the time and
win freedom for the colonists.
Emerson presented his famous
poem on the occasion of the dedication
of the Concord Battle Monument
on July 4, 1837.  Some 150
years later, a group of volunteers,
representing average citizens from
every walk of life, prepared for a new

dedication ceremony at the site of
this famous battle.  This time, the
New Freedom Bell--the gift of NSA
to the United States on the two
hundredth anniversary of its Constitution--
was being brought to 
Concord for the first of many ceremonies
during its three-month New
Freedom Trail across the length
and breadth of the country.
The spirit that drove the
colonists to stand up against the vastly
more powerful country in the 
name of liberty is certainly represented 
in the New Freedom Bell.
Moreover, the spirit that seeks to
secure lasting peace, well-being and
security for all the world's people
was well represented in the gathering
which assembled for the ceremony
in Concord on April 28, 1987.

The basis of civilization, of most highly developed science,
Resolve to be “people of perseverance,”
To open the new history of America.

The tranquil light of peace and happiness
Shall emit its rays of splendor
Only if there is the will, unyielding and indomitable,
To continue to place effort after effort.

Be aware that should you lose perseverance to continue,
The great glory and achievements of the past
Will all but matter naught;
No matter how large,
The principles of math prove
That, multiplied by zero.
The product is always zero.
Buddhism is reason;
The Gosho reads,
That even thousand-year-old pampas grass can be reduced to ashes
In a single moment.

May you never succumb
To the merciless winds of tribulation,
To the obstacles of adversities;
Advance along this road
With persistence, patience, and with perseverance,
For this is the road you yourselves have chosen.

Just as the mighty Mississippi River
Flows ceaselessly along its determined course,
In the biting cold winter,
In the blooming spring of butterflies,
In burning hot summer
And in the autumn of the harvest,
Contentedly it continues to flow with dignity
Day and night.

There is faith that flares up like fire
Only to quickly fade and disappear;
There is faith like the current of water,
Which flows continuously in serenity.

Ours need be the faith of flowing water,
Not knowing of an end,
Washing away the banks of stagnation and languor;
Our faith need be the perpetual river
That continues to flow to reach its destination 
Of the one and inseparable great sea.
16

Perseverance is strength.
Accumulation is strength.
Forget not that only through tireless devotion
Shall faith glow with genuine brilliance;
Thus the life of eternal happiness is fulfilled.

You are the Minutemen of the Mystic Law,
The Whitmans of kosen-rufu,
Shouldering the responsibility 
To inherit the prime point
Of the second chapter of worldwide kosen-rufu.

To mark the first step,
To open a new page in the history of your America;
My friends,
Resolve to be the people of “progressive spirit!”

Only those who bring forth
To the immensity of the prairie,
To the boundless frontier,
The luster of culture
And the refreshing breeze of civilization,
Are those possessing the glorious progressive spirit.

The intellect of progressive minds knows no stagnation;
For they do nothing but earnestly seek
The radiance of truth and wisdom;
The eye of the progressive mind
Knows no dint of darkness;
For they never lose sight
Of the rainbow of hope, far and distant;
For progressive mind knows no hesitation,
For action to take initiative
Itself is our supreme honor.

The course that America led
Itself is the history of progressiveness;
In search of the New World,
With hope for an abundant harvest,
Your people cultivated and cultivated,
Knowing no lassitude.
Behind the continuous advancement 
Is the spirit of pioneers;
This is your eternal pride - 
For the progressive spirit is another name for “pioneering.”

“Day after day renew yourself”
Are words I have cherished
For years since youth,
And so have I fought with all my might.

...To honor in perpetuity these
women, citizens of the United States
of America, whose contributions to
the arts, athletics, business, education,
government, the humanities,
philanthropy and science, have been
the greatest value for the development
of their country.""

With these words, a dream was given life in historic
Seneca Falls, New York, the birthplace of women's rights.
There, in 1848, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott
and 300 others held the first Women's Rights
Convention. With the passage of the Declaration of
Sentiments and Resolutions which said, ""Resolved, that it
is the duty of the women of this country to secure to themselves
their sacred right to the elective franchise,"" history
took place. 72 years later in 1920, the 19th Amendment
to the Constitution granting women the right to vote was
passed. The women and men of Seneca Falls created The
National Women's Hall of Fame in 1969, believing that
the contributions of American women deserved a permanent
home. The Hall is home to exhibits, artifacts of historical
interest, a research library, and offices.

""The First Wave""
The beautiful group of bronze statues greeting visitors in the lobby of the Visitor's Center is known as ""The First 
Wave"".  These statues represent twenty attendees of the 1848 First Women's Rights Convention.  Among them 
are the five organizers of the Convention, four men who supported their cause, and eleven anonymous figures 
who took part in the Convention, but did not sign their names on the ""Declaration of Sentiments"".  More 
information about the sculptures and their creator are readily available at the front desk.

Film
""Dreams of Equality"" is a 30-minute film that dramatizes the First Women's Rights Convention held in the 
Wesleyan Chapel on July 19 and 20, 1848.  The movie features ""Lucy,"" a fictional character who attends the 
Convention but decides not to sign the ""Declaration of Sentiments"".  Our film depicts the culture of the 1840's 
and serves as a great introduction to the exhibits of the Part.  Shown daily, every hour, on the hour.  Included in 
$2 and $3 adult ticket.

Exhibits
The Park's permanent interactive exhibits, located on the second floor of the Visitor Center, describe the events 
surrounding the First Women's Rights Convention.  These educational exhibits also reflect the impact this event 
had on U.S. History.  Included in $2 and $3 adult ticket.

Declaration Park
Rest and relax in peaceful Declaration Park, located next to the Visitor Center.  The stepped seating area and 
park benches are a lovely place to sit and enjoy the wonderful atmosphere of Seneca Falls!  While visiting 
Declaration Park, you will be in the shadows of the remains of the great Wesleyan Chapel, site of the First 
Women's Rights Convention.  The text of the poignant ""Declaration of Sentiments"" and its 100 signers are 
engraved in Pennsylvania Bluestone and are immortalized as a waterwall that stretches 140 feet from one side of 
the Park to the other.  Feel free to stretch out on the lawn and enjoy the gentle breeze.

Visitor's Center Bookstore
We invite you to browse our bookstore.  We carry over three hundred books, including hard-to-find selections 
and works by renowned authors.  Also available are 19th century style wooden toys, T-shirts, videos, posters and 
postcards.  We also carry educational material for teachers.  The bookstore is operated by Eastern National,

""What Does Civil Rights Mean to Me?""
Civil (Siv'al) having to do with citizens
or the state: our Civil Rights
Rights anything correct just or honorable

    To me Civil Rights means that every human
being should have the same opportunity
to do as he or she wishes.  I mean in a manner
that should not be broken down because of the
color of the skin.
     I've listened to my mother as she tells me
those stories of having to go to a colord water
fountain.  Being bused to a white school once
desegregation was brought about.  Why?
     She went on to tell me and my brothers
of the problems that exited in public schools,
housing, employment and public facilities our
nation wide.
     She spoke of a man who gave them a
chance to play in a safe place.  This is a park in
the heart of North Richmond.  His name is the 
late Charles Reed.
     Today we have not a safe place to play.
We are still oppressed, our Civil Rights are ignored.
Drugs are killing our race of black men,
teenagers, women and unborn babies.
     And just thing in school they taught me
that the Emancipation Proclaimation was made
by President Lincoln on January 1, 1863 giving
freedom to negro slaves.  Why?
     We still yet are not free and I feel we'll never
be at least not in my time.  To aquire to work, to
support ones self is something we want to achieve
in ones lifetime.
     And one acheiver that comes to mind is
the little lady Rosa Parks who made a change
for our rightful place on any bus.  And that was
Civil Rights.

MARIA ESTEL GARCIA

""What does Civil Rights Mean to Me?""

     I grew up in a little town of Mexico.  Until 
I came to the United States, at age 6, I had
been almost completely immune to injustice
and racism.  Almost.
     When I was young a very good friend of
mine rejected and shunned by my classmates
because of her skin color, which was just a
shade darker.
     Her pain was my pain.  As I was just a 
little girl, my actions were influenced by the
other children, yet when I saw how they
treated her, keeping her off the play structures
and taunting her, I knew they were wrong to
do so.
     When I came to the United States I started
1st grade.  I learned about what people like
Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, Rosa Parks,
and others had done to help themselves and a
world situation.
     It was then that the word Civil Rights
took on a new meaning.  Civil Rights meant
standing your ground, not having to live by
other peoples expectations but your own.
     Civil Rights; the rights you have as a citizen.
     The meaning of Civil Rights is simple,
Civil Rights are your rights as living creatures.
The right to walk down the street with your
head held high, to get on a bus and sit down
without being worried that someone will tell
you to get up, the right to play where you want
to without someone telling you to leave.
     Those rights, among them the right to be
treated with utmost respect, are for every living
creature, animal or human, black or white,
Asian or Hispanic, European or American.
     Maybe the meaning I set behind Civil
Rights is wrong, but that would in no way
change my view on what Civil Rights is.  I
know what it is.  The name of justice.

""What Does Civil Rights Mean to Me?""

     Being at the age of 12 I truly can not say
what civil rights means to me, but I can truly
say what it has done for me.  When I was very
young my grandmother told me stories 
about civil rights and how my great-grandmother
helped fight to make this world a
better place for everyone.
     Many stories came across my way, but
only one stayed with me.  I can remember it
like it was yesterday.
     NO BLACKS! Read signs everywhere.
NO BLACKS on the water fountains.  NO
BLACKS in the public bathrooms.  All blacks
must use back facilities.  Hearing my grandmother
telling me stories like that made me
feel very upset.  How can people do that to
another human being?  Was my question for
the longest.  To me no one gave definite answer.
As I grew older the question to my
answer became more and more closer as I
experienced first hand the nature of RACISM.
     Then my answer was definite.  People
who are against anyone of color have a problem
with themselves.  The answer was so 
simple.  Those few words allowed me to answer
the main question, what civil rights 
means to me?
     To me civil rights means freedom,
alllowing any and everyone to work in unity.
Without civil rights, today would be like the
past where no one could live and work in
harmony.

""What Does Civil Rights Mean to Me?""

     Civil Rights means to me, my friend
and fellow country-men that I am American
born and American raised, I am an
American, and I am here to stay in this
country and I ain't goin' no where.
     To me Civil Rights has enriched and
enlightened the life of me and my family.
To the fact that we are somebody.  No way
are we second class citizens.  But without
the knowledge of what Civil Rights has
taught us we would not have arrived at
this conclusion.
     Civil Rights has given me determination,
Hope eternal, a sense of self, and
unequated pride:  In who I am and where
I come from, and where I am going.
     It has framed the course for a tedious
journey that follows a well traveled Freedom
Road.  It is the Voice that calls for all
people of substance to unite as one.
     To acheive the Victory of Life, Liberty
and the Pursuit of Happiness as I envision
the Dream of the Master, MLK, to become
a reality.
     Though we may stumble, though we
may fall, Civil Rights calls out to each and
everyone of us, to unite together til Victory
is won.  
     In conclusion, I wish to thank Rosa,
Martin, Medgar, and all the others who
laid the foundation, for the House of Freedom
and Equality.

""What Does Civil Rights Mean to Me?""

    To me civil rights means a very powerful
world. Some people say that it is a phrase
that people of color use, but in some ways it
is true. Civil Rights are for everyone of every
color.
    Civil Rights are words of comfort,
meaning that all people will feel safe knowing
that we have rights. Back in the 50s black
people fought for civil rights because blacks
did not have any rights or respect for our
feelings.
    Blacks could not sit on the front of the
bus, or go to certain stores, and could not
drink out of certain fountains. In that time
blacks did not receive any respect, we did
not have the power to do anything, and in
that matter that is why we fought for civil
rights.
    Today in the 90s after all the wars trails,
tribulations and boycotts blacks are taking,
advantage of our very own rights that we
fought for.
    To me civil rights mean the power to do
to your advantage civil rights means building
up your self esteem to fight for what you
want.
    Some black people often think that
blacks do not have rights and that is often
their reason for wrong doing.
    Black civil right leaders such as Dr.
King, Rosa Parks, Jesse Jackson, were some
of the main people that helped us fight for
civil rights. The least that blacks could do is
at least show a little respect. I am proud to
be an Afro-American.

""What Does Civil Rights Mean to Me?"" 

Contemplation of that question has
caused me to adopt the following attitude.
I have decided that I must set goals and I
must be literate and informed. I must also
make attempts to develop cross cultural 
bridges to better achieve my goals. I have
decided that I must understand and accept
the reality that I am responsible for the
quality of my life; and discipline and control
myself accordingly. 
I must be diligent and steadfast in
pursuing my goals and must resist the
many negative attitudes that might stymie
me. 
I have come to accept the reality that
civil rights are not free tickets to success.
If they were, those who have always enjoyed
civil rights would have a road map
to the so called good life. 
It seems apparent that there are tremendous
barriers to overcome before one
realizes the benefits of those persons who
possess civil rights. It seems true lasting 
benefits only accrue to those who study
hard, work hard, set goals and are willing
to deal positively with problems as they
arise. 
Someone once said that each second
of time begins the rest of your life. And as
one charts his course in life he is well to
remember the scripture from the Bible """"Be
not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever
a man soweth, that shall he also 
reap.""; therefore it seems the civil rights is 
a challenge.

AMOS ADAMS, JR. 

""What Does Civil Rights Mean to Me?""
""CIVIL RIGHTS"" 
Webster's New World Dictionary says, 
Those rights guaranteed to the individual by
the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution 
of the United States and by certain other acts of Congress:
especially, exemption from involuntary servitude
and equal treatment of all people with respect
to the enjoyment of life, liberty, and property and to
the protection of law.
QUESTION
""What Does Civil Rights Mean To Me?"" 
To me, Civil Rights means: equal justice and protection 
under the law. 
To abolish second, third and fourth class citizenship, 
then every citizen automatically becomes first class citizens. 
Anything short of this statuate, nullifies the legislative
act of Civil Rights. 
We have been elevated into the upper categories of
the American society, placing all citizens in the affirmative. 
All citizens will have the legal barriers demolished
and removed, so the power of the mind, will be unleashed. 
Thereby giving every citizen the legal rights under the protection
of the law, to yield to humanity the fruits of the
mind to the fullest. 
Regardless of what your racial, ethnic, or religious
background, being a first class citizen you are on an even
keel with the same footing as all first class citizens.
To me, Civil Rights means: 
We are no longer forced by illegal, unjust, outdated,
jimcrow laws to take the back seat in the bus of progress, 
The bus of justice,
The bus of judicial process,
The bus in the legislative process,
The bus in the decision making process,
The bus in the courts of law, that's railroading our
young black men to jails and prisons, and refuse to accept
the back seat in any categorical bus in society. 
Finally, Civil Rights means: 
When I have a 500 billion dollar plan beneficial to
the nation, I should get the same financial support to perfect
that plan as any other first class citizen.

Rosa Parks poses in the front of a Montgomery bus
on December 21, 1956--the day the buses were
integrated. (UPI-Bettman) 

HOW IT ALL STARTED 
One evening in early December 1955 I was
sitting in the front seat of the colored section 
of a bus in Montgomery, Alabama. 
The white people were sitting in the white
section. More white people got on, and
they filled up all the seats in the white section.
When that happened, we black
people were supposed to give up our seats
to the whites. But I didn't move. The white
driver said, ""Let me have those front
seat."" I didn't get up. I was tired of giving
in to white people. 
""I'm going to have you arrested,"" the
driver said. 
""You may do that,"" I said.
Two white policemen came. I asked one
of them, ""Why do you all push us 
around?"" 
He answered, ""I don't know, but the law
is the law and you're under arrest.""

Rosa Parks with Jim Haskins.

We have come, treading our path through
the blood of the slaughtered,
Out from the gloomy past,
Till now we stand at last
Where the white gleam of our bright star is
cast.

God of our weary years,
God of our silent tears,
Thou who has brought us thus far on the
way:
Thou who has by Thy might
Let us into the light
Keep us forever in the path, we pray.
Lest our feet stray from the places, our
God, where we met Thee,
Lest our hearts, drunk with the wine of the
world, we forget Thee,
Shadowed beneath Thy hand,
May we forever stand,
True to our God
True to our native land.

for a whole people. Her arrest 
sparked a 381-day bus boycott,

Talent, Talent, Everywhere

By GALE HAGANS 
Staff Writer

""Amateur Night At The Apollo"" paled by 
comparison when a host of gifted students 
performed in Clark's talent show recently.

""It was like a blue-light special at Kmart,"" said 
one of the attendees. There was standing room 
only as a full house jammed Davage Auditorium 
for a sample of some of Clark's best talent. 
Claiborne uppers, Sebago suedes and ragged 
Reeboks graced the balcony railing as people 
made room to sit two to a seat.

Sponsored by Miss Clark College and her 
Court, this year’s extravaganza was without a 
doubt a hit. ""For this to be our first event, it was 
really successful,"" said Javette Jenkins, Miss 
Clark College. Complete with a master of 
ceremonies and a house band, the show featured 
both entertainers and mock commercials.

Energy and excitement were high as hundreds 
of students eagerly applauded several of the acts. 
“I am somebody!"" proclaimed actor Lance Boyd 
in his self-awareness monologue. His message 
about drugs, Black consciousness and 
self-esteem stirred the audience to shout cheers 
of agreement. “Say it! Make it plain!"" screamed 
some.

It was a night rich with diversity and variety. 
Dance, drama and music permeated the 
monotony of studying if only for a few hours. All 
of the performers were Clark students and the 
majority of them were freshmen. Still there were 
many upperclassmen present.

One pair of twins rendered a vocal duet while 
another twosome inspired the audience with the 
popular gospel song, “Lord Lift Us Up Where 
We Belong."" An electrifying band called Your 
Choice brought people to their feet with ""Make 
It Last Forever"" and “The Right Stuff."" A very 
creative trio danced and sang to the sultry 
sounds of ""I Don’t Wanna Be Alone Tonight,’’a 
hit from the movie -School Daze-.

One group brought street dancing to center 
stage and tap dancing by another student added 
historical and cultural flavor to the evening. 
Enthusiastic Clarkites chanted ""Go CC, go CC!"" 
as another freshman duo roused school spirit 
with an original composition entitled, ""The Men 
of Brawley.""

Ms. Jenkins added that she and her court were 
in the process of “trying to change the image of 
what campus queens are about."" They are also 
planning more activities and fundraisers for the 
student body. 

The Chaplain Speaks
By PAUL H. EASLEY
Campus Chaplain

   In 1964, I had a dreamed 
fulfilled. I was part of the 1964
Olympics held in Japan. Here
gathered from throughout the
world were those declared to be 
the world's best, competing for
even further recognition and
fame.
   As I recall being in Olympic
Village, I remember looking at
many of the athletes and
stating, ""What is the quality of
life that each possessed?""
   Often in the most unlikely
places, at the most unexpected
times, a life is touched by the
master's hand.
   Rafer Johnson, one of the
world's greatest athletes can
relate how he became a
decathlon champion. He tells
how he competed constantly
for two days in the events that
make up the decathlon; how he
met and made friends with the
first athletes from all over the
world; and how he finally
defeated Russia's track and
field star, Vasily Kuznetzov.
   Most of the athletes I talked
with stated, life was a testing
time for them. For example, if
they had sat down and thought
about all the things which
could have happened to keep
succeeding, they would never
have competed. Instead, they
had the conviction that their
obstacles could be overcome--
and their faith conquered fear.
   A second basic principle
which guided them was ""Right
will triumph.""
   When good men do nothing,
evil men prevail.
   Sometimes the miracle of
being touched by the master's
hand is more forcefully
expressed in an indirect
manner. This miracle, ""The
Touch of The Master's Hand:"" 

Twas battered and scarred, and
the auctioneer
Thought it scarcely worth his
while
To wast much time on the old
violin.
But he held it up with a smile,
""What am I bidden, good
folk?"" he cried.
Who'll start the bidding for me?
A dollar-a dollar-then two,
only two-
Two dollars, and who'll make it
three?
Going for three"" - but no! -
From the room far back a
grey-haired man
Came forward and picked up
the bow.
Then wiping the dust from the
old violin.
And tightening the loosened
strings,
He played a melody pure and
sweet
As a caroling angel sings.

The Music ceased and the
auctioneer,
With a voice that was quiet and
low,
Said, ""Now what am I bid for
the old violin?""
An he held it up with a the bow.
""A thousand dollars--and
who'll make it two?
Two thousand and who'll make 
it three?
Three thousand once--three
thousand twice--
And going-and gone,"" cried he.
The people cheered, but some
of them cried
We do not understand.
""What changed its worth?""
Quick came the reply,
""The touch of the Master's
hand.""
And many a man with life out
of tune,
And battered and scarred with
sin,
Is auctioned cheap to a 
thoughtless crowd,
Much like the old violin.
A ""mess of pottage"" - a glass of
wine,
A game-and he travels on;
He's going once-and going
twice-
He's going-and almost gone!
But the Master comes, and the
foolish crowd
Can never quite understand,
The worth of a soul and the
change that's wrought
By the touch of the Master's 
hand.""

   Anyone who sincerely seeks
the Master will find Him. He
will find His hand always
outstretched, eager to touch
and transform any life willing
to yield to Him. Today's most
important message is that ""God
lives and rules -- and transforms
lives.""
   Until we meet again,
remember: "". . .the Master
comes, and the foolish crowd
can never quite understand the
worth of a soul and the change
that's wrought by the touch of
the Master's hand.""
   See you in Chapel Sunday!

Black Male Success
Continued From Page 7
Dr. Lee concluded.
   Dr. Lee also feels that young
Black men aren't attending
colleges because they are
misled from the truth. ""There is
no sense of urgency for higher
education because young
Blacks have found out that they
can make a few bucks in some
trade directly after high school
graduation. What these youths
don't understand is that they
can only go but so far in that 
trade then life comes to a 
hault.""
    On that same token, petty
officer George Greer has been
in the United States Navy for
four years (stationed in
Charleston, S.C.). He entered
the Navy directly after
highschool because he felt he
wasn't ready for college. ""I've
been in the Navy for four years
but I haven't gotten anything
accomplished. My job became
monotonous because I reached
my limit. There was no room
for me to advance. I could get
more rank, but my job would
continue to be basic,"" he said.
Petty officer Greer, at age 22,
will resume his career by
attending college this fall. He
admitted, ""There's no other
choice for a Black man.""
   Dr. Lee's point that at Clark
College there are four Black
females to every Black male is a
reality that not only exists in
colleges and universities, but
also in life. David George, a
21-year-old Political Science
major at Clark, feels that
excelling in the process of
higher education is parallel to
creating a good relationship.
""Getting an education at
college takes much time and
effort. You must put something
into it in order to get something
out of it. These same facts
apply to successful relationship,""
he asserted.
   According to Dr. Marilyn
Hazzard Lineberger, who
private practices Psychology
and owns a human resource
consulting business in Northeast
Atlanta, a relationship
should be a support system to
counter oppressive forces of 
a Black man's life. However,
the shortage of Black men and
lack of sturdy Black relationships
exist for a reason.
""Because extensive oppression
and depression affect other
avenues of a person's life, often
time the Black man can't cope
and he ends up jeopardizing
any existing relationship that
he may already have,"" Dr.
Lineberger said.
   Although all young Black
men are faced with the plight of
having to suffer from oppression,
basically all of them want
the same objective, said Rev.
McDonald, ""They all want the
American Dream. They want
position and success and they
want to make a contribution.
They don't want to be bums on
the street."" Rev. McDonald
also commented on the
importance of role models. He
feels that the older Black male
needs to get more involved and
that each church should be
responsible to take at least one
young Black man under its
wing.
   When Morgan Delaney, a
24-year-old student at Howard
University, was asked her
opinion of the plight of the
young Black man, not only in
terms of relationships but with
regards to all issues, she
admitted that she had been
confused for a very long time.
""I always felt that Black women
had it harder in this world than
Black men. I maintained that
we have the babies, we go
through monthly inconveniences
and we usually end up
raising children alone. It
always looked as if the man got
off the hook.""
   She continued, ""Now that
I'm a little bit older, I see the
constant rejection that my
Black brothers are going
through. As women, we may
experience physicalities, but I
know as a young Black woman,
I can be educated and can
surely succeed if I'm good at
what I do. If they aren't
educated to a certain degree,
they can hang it up. For them,
it's like a never ending battle."

The Marching Band
Photo by Jim Alexander

   Change, is the perfect word 
to describe the atmosphere 
existing on the campus of 
Clark College. Not only has 
its appearance changed, not 
only has the systems changed, 
but some organizations have 
taken it upon themselves to 
also get a ""new attitude.""
   The Clark College Marching 
Band is one of the 
organizations that has 
undergone some changes for 
self betterment, as well as to 
instill high morale and pride 
to students, faculty  and 
administrators. 
   As a new year approached 
new ideas and plans were 
implemented by Dr. Alfred 
Wyatt, band director, and 
David Byrd, assistant band 
director, along with the 
suggestions and opinions of 
some veteran band members. 
   One of the suggestions was 
to implement a band 
workshop for the purpose of 
marching techniques, musicianship, 
discipline and 
getting aquainted with new 
members to welcome them to 
the family. 
   Dr. Wyatt says that there is 
a greater inner spirit in the 
band students, ""They are very 
excited about the year, "" he 
said. Dr. Wyatt also pointed 
out the fact that the 
Marching Band workshop has 
done wonders for the 
preparation of the new 
students as well as the old. 
   ""The growth of the band 
also has a lot to do with the
atmosphere,"" Dr Wyatt
explained. He hopes it will 
continue to grow, and strive
towards excellence. At the
present time the band has 91
instrumentalists, 33 of whom
are freshman and 27 females
that comprise the auxiliaries.
   Byrd agrees that the
numbers have increased
tremendously in comparison
to previous years. The spirit, 
pride and discipline of the
members have increased.
Byrd attributes that improvement
to the student leaders of
the band. He said ""Dr. Wyatt 
and I can't do it by
ourselves.""
   Although marching techniques,
pride and discipline
are important factors to a
good marching band there is
something else that is
essential and that is a good
sound. Byrd feels that this is
the best sounding band he
has had since he has held his
position.
   Apryl Smith, a junior, says
she was really surprised when
she saw the band this year.
""They're larger and they
sound great. I am really 
proud,"" she said.
   Jerry Freeman, vice
president of the Marching 
Band says that he is proud of 
the changes that have been
made. There seems to be no
more lackadaisical attitudes.
He feels they are better this
year because there are more
people who have a positive
outlook for the future of the
Marching Band. ""Strength
comes in numbers,"" he said.
   This is the first year in
Clark's history that the band
had initiated a workshop or
band camp, and as a result of
it and the hard work from the
student leaders, staff and
directors it has laid strong
foundation that can be built
upon.

Jolene Butts
FIRST 
DRUM 
MAJORETTE

Jolene Butts

By GAIL HAGANS
Staff Writer

   ""It Takes Two To Make A
Thing Go Right"" blasts the
Panther Marching Band and
they couldn't have picked a
more appropriate selection for
the routine. With the sun
beaming and plumes blowing
gently in the wind, they snap to
attention at the mere sound of a
whistle.
   If you thought you saw two
students directing the band you
weren't seeing double. This
year's marching season features
a drum major and a drum
majorette, Edgar ""Iggy"" Hines
and Jolene Butts. Usually, the
leader of the band is a male
upperclassman but as Clark
will see many changes this year,
the band is no exception. Ms.
Butts is the first female drum
major in the (years) history of
Clark's marching band.
   Jolene, a musician of nearly 
thirteen years, plays the piccolo
and flute. She is a senior
majoring in mass communications.
While she is involved in 
several campus activities the
band is a big part of her life. I
manage my time by making out 
a schedule of everything I have
to do.  I also use these
in-between moments to do 
something constructive,"" said
Ms. Butts.
   Ms. Butts felt that she had an
obligation to the marching
Panthers. ""We have talent from
all over the country in our
band. I saw a opportunity to try
to enhance and develop that
potential as a drum majorette,""

she explained. ""I really enjoy it.
We have fun and motivating
the crowd at football games is
really exciting.""
   Band director Dr. Alfred
Wyatt commented by saying
that Ms. Butts was selected not
because it was time for a female
band leader, but because she
was good and capable of
performing well. Band
members have also expressed
their confidence in her abilities.
""I enjoy working with her; she
is firm but understanding at the
same time,"" offered one
student. ""I think it's great!""
expressed another.
   Jolene does not stand alone 
though. She works alongside
Hines in an effort to instill
pride and self-discipline in the
musicians. Their cooperative 
efforts have paid off as the 
band continues to excell at
half-time. The energy and time
that goes into each show is
exhausting according to Hines.
Breathing heavily and evidently
fatigued, he revealed
that working with a woman has
not hindered band morale or
performance in the least bit.""
   ""I want to set a good
example,"" said Ms. Butts. Her
family and friends have 
supported her and she has no
doubts about doing her job
well. She was once a drum
majorette of her high school
marching band and does not 
foresee any problems with her
role. Her attitude is ""You know
you have a job to do, so do it."""

Volleyball Team Hopeful
By Tim Rose
Sports Editor
and
Ronnette Smith
Contributing Writer

   The Panthers women's 
volleyball team is young,
talented, and inexperienced. 
Dominated by the play of 
freshmen and one sophomore,
the 14 girl team is looking
forward to a competitive year.
   Newly appointed and 
current head women's basketball
Coach Larry Nolley stated.
""We don't have a lot of
experience, which is an
incentive to make us work
harder; we do have talent.""
   Clark entered their fifth
match against Oglethorpe
College with a 2-2 record.
Although the players and
coaches felt that they could be
undefeated at this mark, the
team showed little despair in
their lost to Oglethorpe.
   With wins over cross town
rival Morris Brown College
and Bennett, and loses to
Spelman College and Paine
College, they continue to be 
motivated.
   The team traveled to
Augusta on Saturday to face a
Southern Intercollegiate
Athletic Conference (SIAC)
opponent Paine College, only
to come up on the short end.
   Although the Panthers are
suffering from inexperience,
another stigma sets in on the
mindset of the coaches and
players. In order to compete on
the Division II SIAC level, the
volleyball team needs ten
conference games in order to
compete for conference
recognition (the team only has
five). Coach Nolley and the
athletic director is working
tenaciously to overcome this
feat.

Tigers Look Good On Paper
By TIM ROSE
Sports Editor

   When Clark takes on the
Tigers of Savannah State: the
Panthers are uncertain what
team will show up. State have
lead their opponents in the first
half in all of their games. The
Tigers football team is a ball
club that is undergoing
transition. At times the Tigers
look real good, at others
moments, the Tigers look like a
resurrected ball club.
   Although the team has
suffered only one marginal
defeat, (to the hands of Morris
Brown College) Savannah
looks good on paper.
   One area the Clark College 
Panthers will not have to
second guess during homecoming
game is the quarterback
position. The junior college
transfer Richard Basil has been
no less than consistant.
   In the season opener against

Continued on Page 15

Tuskegee University, (the
reigning SIAC champions)
Basil threw four touchdowns as
the Tigers went on to upset TU
31-21. Head coach Bill Davis
of Savannah State says ""Basil
gives our offense a new
dimension. He is a leader and
makes few mistakes on the
field; he's a good runner and
throws the ball well.""
   In the Tigers second game,
they lead Alabama A&M
10-0 in the first period. In the
second quarter, State's offense
sputtered as it was unable to
produce any more points in the
remaining quarters. Basil was
sacked seven times and is one of
many areas Coach Davis vows
to work on. State was upset
14-10. Against Wofford
College, the Tigers seemed to
be working on all cylinders.
Led by Basil, he completed 20
out of 30 passes for 195 yards
yards and three touchdowns.
Shannon Sharpe, a six foot
three, 220 pound, All--
America wide receiver and
brother of Green Bay Packers
Sterling Sharpe, caught 11
balls for 143 yards and two 
touchdowns.
   Sharpe who has caught 27
passes for 339 yards and four
touchdowns in four previous
games, he is slightly off his
league leading pace a year ago
when he caught 60 balls for 
1,078.
Wofford took matters at hand
and gained 307 rushing yards
against State's problem
defensive front. Wofford upset
the Tigers 24-23 in a game
they lost several key players.
   The situation did not get any
better for the 2-2 ball club as
they faced 4-1 Morris Brown
College at Herndon Stadium.
The Wolverines are tied with 
Albany State for the Southern
Intercollegiate Athletic
Conference lead. Both are 
4-0.
   With inconsistant play on
the offensive line, running
backs Corey Ladson, season
starter Wesley Benyard, (whom
missed two games this season)
and Fredrick Hawkins all have
been injured.
   On Savannah State's first
possession, they went without a
huddle in shotgun formation. It
paid off when Savannah scored
in the first two minutes of the
ball games. State continued this
formation only to end the first
quarter with a 7-0 lead. Basil
completed five passes in the
drive with a 14 yard touchdown
pass to Antonio Johnson.
Morris defeated State 18-7.
   With a 2-3 record and one
of the best wide receivers in the
country, the Clark College
defense will have their hands
full.

Geeter Recalls Good Old Days
By RONNETTE V. SMITH
Contributing Writer

  There has been a drastic
change in the athletic programs
at Clark College over the past
50 years. The environment,
concerns, and potential of the
Panther athletics has fallen 
from championship standards,
to sub par winning seasons.
With the changing of the guard
in the athletic department,
Clark has hired a new athletic
director, football coach, and
sports information director.
   Melvin ""Geter"" Lee was
recruited to Clark on a football
scholarship in 1939. He was
recruited by one of the greatest
coaches to ever coach at Clark.
""Ralph (Hogmaw) Robinson,
who was a graduate of Clark
University and coach William 
Puckett, who was also a
graduate of Clark, made me
proud to be a Clarkite. I
volunteer my time, and have
been here so long because I love 
Clark.""
   During my era, ""Clarkites
treated each other with the
respect that Clarkites deserve.
There were fewer guys playing
football in those days, but
everyone worked together.
There was little animosity
among the players. In partnership
with the players, students
supported the team with their
presence at the games. Win or
lose students should have
loyalty to their school; values
have changed.""
   Most students are in school
to receive Bachelors Degrees in
the Arts and Sciences. It would
be wise for them to think about
receiving a CS (Common Sense
Degree). Their parents paid for
them to attend all the home
games in the activity fee; that
alone should be taken advantage
of, not to mention just
being wise enough to support 
and back your own, stated
Geter.
   ""Respect and discipline is the
key in the good ole' days; if we
did not have anything else, we
had that!"" The football players
need more discipline and
respect in the areas of practice
and being a student-athlete.
""We have to do this thing
together.""
   In order to return to the
positive things of the good ole'
days, three things must be
done. Requirements about
grades and NCAA guidelines
must be made specific to the
recruited players; ample
housing facilities for players
must be provided. They need to
be together for that support
system. Lastly, when a player
supports his college ""the only 
fair thing to do is treat him with
respect.""
   Clarkites, as a whole, need to
return to the good ole' days.
""We need to be taught how to 
appreciate the athletic
programs, and give them 
support.""

Ft Valley Shuts Out Clark
   The saga continues for the winless Panthers when they
took on Fort Valley State in the annual Textile Classic in
Griffin, Ga. Saturday night. The Wildcats took off to a early
lead when running back Curtis Bell set a school rushing
record with 266 yards. The transfer running back who
resides in Gary, Ga., broke the old school record of 221
yards set by Sam Coverson against Savannah State in 1972.
   The Panthers never jelled to put any points on the board
in the first half but managed to keep the Cats close with a
15-0 halftime deficit. With Fort Valley State 0-3 coming in
the game, State took out all frustrations in a 43-0 triumph
over the Panthers.

Spencer Is Man With Mission
By TIM ROSE
Sports Editor

   Newly appointed head football coach
William Spencer is on a mission. The Coach is
here to bring not only Southern Intercollegiate
Athletic Conference (S.I.A.C.) championships
but to bring respectability to Clark's football
program.
   With the support of students and faculty, the
newly hired head coach seemed pleased with
8,000 fans coming to Herndon Stadium Labor
Day night. Spencer stated, ""When you win ball
games, people change their attidtude. We want
our fans to jump on the band wagon now, not
just when we are winning ball games.""
   Coach Spencer and one of his assistants
attended the Winston-Salem versus Hampton
University contest earlier in September. Spencer
states, ""The Winston-Salem supporters took 25
bus loads of fans and this is what we would like 
to have, more fan support not just at home
games.""
   With 18 years of coaching experience on the 
collegiate level, Spencer has coached at many
major institutions around the country. How
hard was it to leave a Division I-A school to
coach at a Division II school? ""Not hard at all, I
made up my mind many years ago that coaching 
is what I wanted to do, and now my chance have
arrived.""
   Why is there no Black head coaches on the 
Division I-A level? ""Football is big business and
when dollars are involved, big business is one of
the other color and alumni and supporters
cannot conceive a Black man at the helm.""
   In getting the football team back to
respectability the coach have taken several steps.
""One of the first steps that will be taken is to
recruit athletes that have a burning desire to stay
in school and be successful on the field as well as
in the classroom. We want athletes who want to
stay in school and get an education and
graduate.""
   After the team suffered from its season opener
lost to cross town rival Morris Brown, 29-6, the
coach said, ""The overall assessment of the
players has been quite good. Attitudes were
positive and we accomplished a lot in practice
and I told the players one game does not make
the season, the season is ahead of us.""
   The Clark Panthers football team seem to
pride themselves on character and it showed
throughout their first contest. Asked if is this one
of the characteristics the team have inherited
from their coach? ""No, I don't think so. Each
player pulls from within himself. As a people this
is what has made us.""
   With the football team only winning one game
a year ago, what can the fans expect that we did
not see last year? ""I don't know about last year
but we are going to win ball games,"" he said
emphatically.
   ""Offense is a concern as well as defense. We
have a lot to iron out as the season goes along we
hope to solve these problems.""
   Clark has two competitive quarterbacks in
sophomore Marlow Roberson and freshman
Tirrell Moore. Spencer expressed pride in their
performance in the Morris Brown game.

""The overall
assessment of the
players has been 
quite good.""

   ""We felt both of our quarterbacks did a good
job, we just did not execute well.""
   In addition to the fine quarterbacks on the
squad, the team is lead on defense by senior
linebacker Donnie Williams from Macon, Ga.
Williams is six feet two inches, 220 pounds, and
is on many pre-season honors list. The offense is
flanked by junior receiver Millard Hamilton
from Ridgeland, S.C. whom the coaches turn to
for the big play. Hamilton is five feet 10 inches,
180 pounds and is expected to be on many post
season honor rolls.
   With his wholesome appearance, his firm
handshake and his warm greeting, one would
think the new head football coach was running
for office in this November's election.

   One way the athletic
department is going about this
procedure will be to lure
schools to play tri--matches.
For instance, it will be like a
round robin tournament so all
schools can benefit and meet 
the quota.
   Home games are played at
Morris Brown College because
they have a regulatory size
gymnasium and equipment.
Next home game will be on
Oct. 10, at Morris Brown
against the Morris Brown
Wolverines.
   Coach Nolley expects that by
the time most of the young
ladies are juniors and seniors,
they'll be one of the top--notch
teams in the SIAC conference.

   Quarterback Richard Basil is
highly respected by defenses
around the league because he is
so versatile and is able to find
the open receiver. Since the 
Tigers have all three running
backs healthy, Basil now can
spread the ball around to make
opposing defenses cover all the 
guns.

By Terri L. Shell
Contributing Writer

Carriers of the spirit torch,
Clark College Cheerleading 
Squad is geared up for the
1988 football season.
With seven freshmen on the 
13-member squad, the 
cheerleaders have a fresh 
look.
cheerleaders have a fresh
look.
""This squad is full of 
energy!"" explained Billette 
Owens Ashford, cosponsor of 
the group.
""We had 58 girls to try out.  
After the first cut, we had 20.  
Then we picked the 13-
member squad,"" explained 
their cosponser, Valerie 
Jordon.
The criteria for tryouts 
included their overall ability 
for precision and their ability 
to catch on because ""It's hard 
to take styles from across the 
country and merge,"" explained
Ms. Ashford.
Outside of being sponsor, 
Ms. Ashford is the coordinator
for Drug Free Schools.  It 
is a program in Atlanta 
Public School System.  She is 
also a Clark College alumna, 
class of 1981 and excheerleader.
""I've been sponsor for five 
years.  Our goal is to conduct 
clinics for high schools and 
park organizations located in 
this area.
""I only ask the squad to 
keep their grades and have 
fun because they are here to 
get a degree,"" Ms. Ashford 
commented.
The team consists of 
Cassandra Hayward, captain, 
of Claxton, Ga.; Carla 
Bellamy, co-captain, of 
Pheonix City, Ala.; Djuna 
Harris, co-captain, of Mobile, 
Ala.; Tracie Andrews of 
Atlanta; Yvette Davis of 
Sarasota, Fla.; Katrina Elliot 
of Atlanta; Shirron Jeffries of 
Flint, Mich.; Wilma Jones of 
Washington, D.C.; Kristine 
Mitchell of Oakland, Calif. 
Wanda Nesbitt of Plant City, 
Fla. Earnelle Pritchett of 
Decatur; Chaunda Tyson of 
Brunswick, Ga. and Miranda 
White of Smyrna.
Djuna Harris said, ""We 
want to promote school 
spirit.  Hopefully our high 
spirits will get students 
interested.""
Freshmen Kristine Mitchell 
said that cheering is fun but 
she expected a lot more from 
the football team.  ""I love 
cheering in front of an 
audience.  I hope they enjoy 
it.""
Cassandra Hayward, 
explained, ""This squad holds 
an outstanding group of 
talented young ladies.  
Everyone contributes things 
that they have done throughout
their years of cheering.""
The sponsor is very 
supportive.  She sees that 
everything is going smoothly,
she added.
""Homecoming is a time we 
look forward to because we 
are the 'spirited ones.'  We are
 looked upon to make it a 
success.""

CLARK COLLEGE MAJORETTES
Show Their Stuff!
By Dwan Pete
Staff Writer

Think precision.  Think 
fine-tuned.  Think style, 
beauty, and grace.  
1931 rag-top Jaguar Roadster?
No.
1988 Clark College 
Marching Panther Majorettes?
Yes.
For those of you who have 
not yet attended a Panther 
football game, the majorettes 
are the beautiful young ladies
who perform dazzling dance 
routines and baton twirls in 
front of the band at half-time.  
Their purpose is ""to add 
glamour to the marching 
band,"" according to majorette 
co-captain Kimberly George.
And that, they do.  Doing 
intricate, synchronized dance
steps that they choreograph 
themselves, the majorettes 
add the touch of finesse and 
class to Clark's football 
games that, unfortunately, 
our football team often does 
not display on the field.
But whether the team is 
faring well by half-time, or 
being blown out of the water, 
the majorettes are always
smiling, enthusiastic, and 
hopeful.  Why?  Because they 
have school spirit, a quality 
that some feel is lacking at 
Clark.
People aren't nearly as 
spirited as say, the class of 
'85, probably because the 
team hasn't been winning.  
You shouldn't have to have a 
winning team to have school 
spirit,"" says majorette captain 
Kimberly Harper.  ""The band
(and those who perform with 
the band) is the only group 
that really shows school spirit 
at the games.""
Besides their cheerful 
performance on the field, 
evidence of the majorettes' 
school spirit can be seen off 
the field as well.  They 
practice, on the average, three 
hours every day, meeting 
among themselves and 
working with the marching 
band in perfecting their 
routines.  In addition, the 
majorettes sell everything 
from seat cushions to donuts 
to raise money to pay for 
their sequined uniforms.
The Clark College Marching
Panther Majorettes 
include: Kimberley Harper, 
captain; Kimberley George 
and Winona Maolud, 
co-captains; Kim Smith; 
Ursula Miller; Sonja Shepherd;
Deidree Bradley; and 
Margaret Brown.  The banner 
carriers are: Danita Ragland, 
captain, Demetra Strickland 
and Joyce Mitchell.
In the words of captain 
Kimberley Harper, ""We are 
high-stepping, toe-pointing, 
baton-twirling, smiling 
majorettes.""

First Attendant

Attendant Strives for New Image
by MEREDITH LAWSON
Assistant Lifestyle Editor

When you think of an 
independent Black woman 
who is both outgoing and 
knowledgeable, who has 
served and represented her 
institution well and who is 
able to take on any obstacle 
put before her, you think 
Elayna Rucker - First 
Attendant to Miss Clark 
College and Miss United 
Negro College Fund (UNCF).
Ms. Rucker is a true 
Clarkite, during this year of 
history in the making at 
Clark with a new president 
and plans of consolidating 
with Atlanta University. 
Along with being a member 
of Miss Clark's court, she 
also holds the second highest 
queen title of the college, 
Miss UNCF. 
When asked how she was 
chosen to hold the second 
most prominent title she 
explained, ""Whichever class 
raises the most funds for 
UNCF, a queen is chosen 
from that class by the UNCF 
committee. I guess the 
committee felt that I was 
most dedicated to the cause."" 
Ms. Rucker will represent 
Clark College at the 1989 
National UNCF Convention 
in March at New Orleans. 
And, once again she will 
work diligently to raise 
money next semester when 
UNCF kicks off their annual 
ceremonies.
""Being on the court of Miss
Clark is basically what I
expected and a whole lot
more.  It takes a lot of
dedication, hard work and
time management because
we're trying to change the

image of Miss Clark and her
court,"" she explained.  When
asked how she and the court
were going to change that
image she stated, ""We
participate in service projects
and hold on and offcampus
activities.  This is something
we are pursuing with both
feet.""
Last month the court
sponsored a variety show that
proved to be a success based
on both attendance and next
day converstation.  The court
is also sponsoring a food
drive until the end of 
homecoming.  Ms. Rucker
commented, ""I challenge each
of my fellow Clarkites to 
bring a canned good to every
Student Government Association
(SGA) activity they
attend.""  Activities the student
body can look forward to,
according to Ms. Rucker, are
as follows: a seminar on
college career goals, Clark
College history trivia game,
dormitory socials, Halloween-
OGrams, a Toy Drive and
movies in Davage Auditorium.
The court will also be
sponsoring off campus
activities such as AdoptA-
Child each month and a
dinner of appreciation for the
cafeteria and maintenance 
staffs.
Ms. Rucker, a 21yearold
native of Minneapolis, Minn.,
is one of three children, who
all attend Clark.  The senior,
honor student is both a 
knowledgeable and outgoing
person.  Her involvements,
past and present, illustrate
this.  They are: freshman
vicepresident, first attendant
to Miss Freshman, SGA
representative, Merner Hall

Big Sister, member of Delta
Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.,
member of Morehouse
Business Association, Miss
Delta Charm, Miss Crimson
and Creme and representative
for AUC Week.
""My ultimate goal is to
become an entrepreneur, and
bring back to my people what
my people have taught me
and more,"" she stated.  Ms.
Rucker is working diligently 
to reach her goal, and this
summer she inched closer to
it.  She worked at Clairol Inc.
as a sales representative in
Atlanta.  The marketing major
explained why she enjoyed
her intern, ""Clairol and the
experience made me more
aware of the business world,
and how to relate to people
in a businesssocial relationship.""
On the consolidation issues
and new school year the first
attendant stated, ""I believe
this year has become a new
beginning for everyone.  New
ideas will help Clark grow as
an institution; also, the ideas
will permit the administration
and students to work closer
together.  If we continue doing
just that, we can make Clark
become more of a ""home
away from home.""
Ms. Rucker wants her
classmates to remember that
neither does it matter if you
hold a position or title on
campus, and nor does it 
matter if you do not
accomplish a goal the first
time.  However, she said its
important that students
remember, ""Your greatest
goal consists not in falling,
but in rising every time you
fall.""

Verlinda Fulfills
Longtime Dram
By JOLENE S. BUTTS
News Editor

It started in small town--
Griffin, Ga.  A girl was born
and she bloomed into a sweet
popular and dedicated young
lady.  She is Verlinda
McGlotha.
In her high school days she
participated in several
organizations such as the
National Honor Society, the
Beta Club, the Math Club,
the cheerleading squad and
many more.
Verlinda is a 21-year-old
senior majoring in business
administration with a 
concentration in finance.  She
says that her major requires a
lot of hard work and
managing time is essential.
Although her major is
demanding she still finds time
to do the things that she
enjoys the most, like singing,
jogging, rollerskating, reading
and volunteer work on her
own and with her sorority,
Alpha Kappa Alpha.
Verlinda says that she
really enjoys participating in
activities with her sorority
sisters because each event
brings them closer together.
She feels that it is important
for young Black females in
college to have a bond of
sisterhood.
Believing in and knowing
yourself is important and
with that in mind Verlinda
decided she wanted to
compete for the illustrious

title of Miss Clark College.
""Miss Clark College should
be one who is friendly and
down to earth.""  She feels that
 one should not have to 
change her personality when
elections roll around. ""Just
being yourself, down to earth,
happy and helpful to others
are essential characteristics
for not just Miss Clark but
for everyone,"" she said.
She expressed strongly that
she always wanted to be the
queen of the college she
attended when that time
came.  Verlinda says she
remembers when she was a
little girl she would stand in
front of the mirror and
practice waving at the crowd
as if she was on a fully
decorated float filled with
beautiful flowers of every
color.

""Miss Clark
should be one is
friendly and down
to earth""

Verlinda feels that she
possesses the leadership
qualities needed to be an
attendant to the title of Miss
Clark.  The organizations of
which she is a member are
exemplifications of those
qualities.  They are: the
Student Government Association,

National Association for
the Advancement of Colored
People and the Women's 
Resource Center.
She says that even though
she did not win the title she
didn't lose.  She really gained
a true sense of unification,
love and understanding.
Verlinda says she loves being
second attendant.  ""Miss
Clark, the first attendant and
myself are all unified.  We 
work together for one
common goal -- the betterment
of Clark College.""
As well as obtaining the
title of second attendant
Verlinda has also accomplished
many other things.  She
has received several scholarships.
They are: The Alpha
Kappa Alpha Scholarship,
the Agnes B. Hunt Scholarship,
the Kelsey Board of
Trustees Scholarship and the
United Methodist Scholarship.
When asked how she
accomplished so many things,
she gave all the credit to God.
She said, ""The support from
my parents, family and
friends has been so very
special, but I realize that God
has supplied me with them
and all of my accomplishments
and his love and
support is eternal.""

IlLonka
Aims To
Boost
School
Pride

""I was a student before I
was a queen. Now I am 
both.""

By STACI BEASLEY
Lifestyle Editor

Many little girls dream of
becoming a queen someday
but as the years go by their
energy turns into other
accomplishments. Yet there 
are still some little girls whose
dreams of becoming a queen
turn into reality.
For one young lady, her
dream became a reality that
will be an accomplishment for
the rest of her life. Her name
is IlLonka Javette Jenkins
and she is Miss CLark College
1988-89.
""I would not trade being
Miss Clark College for
anything in the world. It is an
experience that I will cherish
a lifetime,"" noted IlLonka
with a smile on her face. She
added that it is a honor to be
selected by her classmates to 
represent the school.
 IlLonka is a 21 year-old
native from La Grange, Ga.,
majoring in middle grade
education with a concentration
in language arts and
social studies. ""I chose
education because I feel that
it is important that we 
educate Black children to
their full potential. It is just
as important for a student to
learn how to read and write
as it is for him to be in tune
with who he is and what
direction he wants to go in,""
she stated with a firm voice.
During her tenure as Miss
Clark College, IlLonka has a
lot of plans. Topping her list
is changing the image of her

position. ""Miss Clark College
is not just a Homecoming
queen but a Black woman
and student with a lot of
goals ahead of her,"" she
explained, while expressing
that being a queen is not just
a cosmetic position. She said
a queen must be able to relate
to people as well as not worry
about looking her best
everyday. ""I was a student
before I was a queen now I
am both,"" she explained.
She describes her duties as 
Miss Clark as fun and 
exciting. IlLonka and her
court are busy getting ready
for Homecoming and after
Homecoming they will begin
recruiting for the school. ""We
are presently trying to start
an adopt-a-child program
that will consist of my court
and I adopting a child in the
John Hope Homes (housing
project) for one month.
During the adoption period
we will take them out and
expose them to the better
things in life,"" she noted.
John Hope Homes is a 
low-income housing development
located adjacent to
Clark's campus.
Being involved in school
activities is nothing new to 
IlLonka who has been an 
active member in several
school activities. She is a
member of the Student
Government Association
(SGA), Philharmonic Society,
Inspirational Voices of Faith
Gospel Choir, Kappa Delta

Upsilon (Honor Society),
National Association for the
Advancement of Color
People (NAACP) and Alpha
Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.
""As a student you should
always keep your goals and
priorities in order; however,
everyone should get involved
in some type of activities
because it helps balance your 
academics and it makes you a
more versatile person,"" she
stated.
IlLonka finds time in
between her busy schedule to
do the things that she likes
most. She enjoys reading,
writing poetry, writing
monologes, and working with
people. ""When I am happy it
is because I am around
people that make me happy,""
she noted.
It is because of her strong
faith in God that IlLonka feels
as though she has made it
this far. ""I am a strong

believer in getting on my
knees and praying and I also
realize that you have to
believe in your prayer.
Anything you believe in, you
can achieve but you must
never give up,"" she said
emphatically.
She went on to say that she
is happy that she chose Clark
College. She said that it is
equally important to graduate
from Clark as it is to
contribute to the school after
graduation. She noted, ""I
wish that we could instill
more pride within the
students, faculty, staff,
administration and then we
will truly become a Clark 
College family.""
When the time comes for
IlLonka to relinquish her
crown, one of the hardest
things for her will be saying
good-bye to her crown as well
as her court, she said. She 
described her court as being
talented women to work with.

Her message to them:
""Thank you for all your love
and inspiration and continue
to be the beautiful people
that you are. Keep reaching 
and hoping and you both will
continue to be the very
successful women that you
are,"" she said with obvious
emotion.
As she leaned up in her
chair with a smile on her face 
and a sense of pride in her
voice, IlLonka confidently
stated, ""As a student at Clark
College, I have learned more
about myself as a Black
person. Also, my surroundings
have made me aware of
the problems which we as
Blacks face. I am proud to be
a queen of a Black institution
and it is a great feeling
knowing that there are so
many Black queens around 
the country who symbolize
something real and important
to the Black Community.""

Education:  The Answer To Black Man's Success?

Black Males 
On Backburner
In Society

By LISA HARRISTON
Managing Editor

     In a studio apartment on
Chillum Road in Chillum,
Md., Jay ""Vinny"" Smith (a
pseudonym) lounges around 
his ""home"" in a formerly
white T-shirt (bleached faded
blue and patched with dark
blue from incorrect washing),
a pair of Gap blue jeans and
brown socks.  His head is
crowned with a stocking cap
""to provide for waves,""  he
said.  He nibbles on a plate
full of French fries, which (to
him) are sufficient enough for
a snack.
     The studio apartment is
quite unfurnished - a
mattress on the floor in the
main room, one ragged chair
in the corner (which Vinny
reveals would probably
collapse if someone over 100
lbs. sat in it) and a stereo 
system that contradicts the
chair's appearance.  ""If
nothing else, the music has to
sound right.  That set broke
me,"" he admitted.  On the way
to the bathroom in the back
is a pantry type area which
occupies towels, clothes on a 
rack (an open closet), one
cologne bottle, several pairs
of tennis shoes and other
various articles. The kitchen
area is almost bare.  A case of
Miller Lite is the first 
noticeable item in the
refrigerator, he said.  He eats
out a lot.
     Vinny is a 21-year-old
Black male who dropped out
of Northwestern high school
in Hyattsville, Md. at age 17.
He described his childhood 
days as mischievous but fun.
""I was into everything but the 
right thing,"" he remarked.
While working on receiving 
his GED, Vinny is temporar-
ily employed at a nearby fast
food restaurant.  His mother
is an associate of the landlord
who owns Chillum apartments; 
therefore, Vinny is
lucky to have his rent
practically paid each month.
He contributes whatever he
can.  He doesn't own a car,
but sometimes has access to
his mother's.
     The lifestyle of this young

individual is one which may
not be so different from
another of his kind somewhere 
else in the nation.  His
lifestyle is limited.  He is fixed
into a situation which is more
likely to worsen than
improve.  He is part of the
one race and gender
(combined) which encounters
the most problems out of life.
According to Rev. Tim
McDonald of First Iconium
Baptist Church and director
of Special Projects at the
Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference headquarters
in Atlanta, all across the
country, young Black men
(like Vinny) are considered
the most oppressed individuals 
in America.  ""There is no
other human being more
ostracized an alienated than
the Black male.  The most
problemed ones are those
aged 16 through 24.  These are
the ones most victimized by
racism and unemployment,""
he commented.  Rev. McDonald 
said he sees a very dim
future for these youth who
must grow up in a world that
will majorly reject them.
    Is Vinny happy with
himself?
   He answered, ""Well, I will
be happier in the near future.
I know I could have done
better as a child, but I feel
that my time is not up yet.
Once I get my GED, I want
to go to a technical school
and fix machines like
refrigerators, air conditioners
and heaters.  I have the skill,
it's just that I need a GED

before I can get started.  Then
I will be on my way.""
     Vinny feels his mother
doesn't understand him.  ""She
has me mapped out to be
someone else.  I'm not dumb.
I know how to read and
write.  I'm just a little behind
on my life's plan right now.
She helps me with my rent,
but that's just so I can get my
start.  I think she hates my
situation.""  He said it hurts
him to see some of his peers

[*The plight
of the Black
man became
an oppressed
one way before 
the evolvement 
of the
20th Century*]

so far ahead of him, but that
college isn't for him and they
went to college.
     Vinny is one young Black
man who doesn't realize how
hard his near future will be.
He is not yet thoroughly
educated, but even if he was,
he'd still be sure to experience
problems.

     Dr. Jackie Magner-Harris,
a psychologist who practices
in Atlanta under Magner-
Harris associates, admits that
young Black males are
disenfranchised from the
mainstream of society because
of deficits in education and
training.  She said, ""Black
males are more susceptible to
committing acts of violence
and drugs because there 
aren't enough Black role
models.""
     Theron Godbee, a junior
Business Administration
major at Clark College,
agrees with Dr. Magner-
Harris' point of view.  ""I am a
Black male who is affected,
but I have a younger brother
who really has it worse than I 
do.  He is growing up in an
atmosphere where role
models are hard for him to
find.  Athletes are into drugs
and alcohol and many
prestigious Blacks are
revealed to be gay or
criminal,"" he stated.
     The John Harland Boys
Club, located in Southwest
Atlanta, is a public organization 
which facilitates young
Black male kids for a few
hours five days out of the
week.  The boys go to the club
after school for what they
may see as recreation, but for
what David Johnson, director
of the West End branch of
the club, calls extensive
development of self-esteem.
""These kids are our future
Black mainstream population.
We are now helping them to
work up to their potential

through specific programs
focusing on citizenship and
leadership development,
cultural enrichment, social
communication and much
more.  Our kids also do
community work,"" Johnson
stated.
     He continued to say that 
most of the kids come from
the neighborhood projects.
He added, ""I believe that
growing up as a poor Black
young male can be one of the
most difficult trials of a 
young person.  We teach these
kids to believe in themselves
and we expose them to as
many things as possible so
that they won't look at
poverty as a dead end.""
     With regards to education,
many young Black men like
Vinny and unlike Theron feel
that higher education isn't
necessary for success.  Dr.
Myra Burnett, assistant
professor of Psychology at
Spelman College, stated that
there are plenty of fields 
present for young Black men
to pursue in which only the
basics of education are
essential.  Vinny is content
with the idea of making it
without a college degree,
while Theron is convinced
that life without one would
be more than incomplete.
""There's no way I could reach
my definition of success
without that piece of paper,
and I don't even want to stop
there.  I feel there's more to
making it than just having a 
degree,"" Theron asserted.
     According to Dr. Samuel
Tucker, who private practices
Psychology in Northwest
Atlanta, not going to college
is a terrible mistake for the
young Black man.  He said,
""Research has already shown
that a Black individual who
goes to college and obtain a
degree does much better than
that Black individual who
didn't attend college at all ""

    If higher education has
proven to be one of the major
tools for the Black man's 
success, why isn't the average
Black male motivated to go 
that far?  The chairman of the
Psychology Department at
Clark College, Dr. Carson
Lee, stated that the plight of
the Black man became an 
oppressed one way before the
evolvement of the 20th 
century.  He said Black men
are historically known for not
being responsible.  ""It all
stems from long ago.  Many
young Black men didn't go to
college because they weren't
pressured into going.  The 
young Black females were
always encouraged to take
care of themselves.  Now at
Clark, there are four females
to every male and if it weren't
for Morehouse, men would
hardly be visible in the
Atlanta University Center,""

Anti-drug Movie:  Promotes Economic
Growth Among Blacks

By JACQUELINE REID
Entertainment Editor

To most people, it would be
inconceivable to create a 
motion picture that would not
only be entertaining, but also
serve as a fundraiser for various
charitable organizations,
promote economic development
among Blacks, and raise
the nation's social consciousness
about ethnic identity and
drug abuse.
Well, noted Black journalist
Tony Brown has successfully
achieved this task and plans to
take the film industry by storm. 
Brown has expanded his
talents by creating, writing,
directing, producing and
distributing ""The White Girl"",
an anti-drug film that deals 
with the cocaine addiction of a 
Black college student.  The
journalist plans to make a 
profit from his picture, but
wants to give the community an
opportunity to share in the 
wealth.
Profit and non-profit
organizations have the 
opportunity to sponsor the
showing of the movie in their
community.  Provided that they
share 20 percent of their profit
with Tony Brown Productions,
who invested $2 million in the
film.  Brown plans to release the
movie in public theatres in
1989.
This process is part of his
3-year old ""Buy Freedom""

campaign to motivate economic
independence and
growth in the Black community.
""The White Girl"" is the first
of five films the journalist plans
to release in the next five years.
All of which he will allow
organizations to sponsor for
fund-raising.
Through various organizations
Brown has debuted his
film ""The White Girl"" to
audiences across the country.
The first preview at Georgia
State University in Atlanta
received positive feedback
from students and staff.  Out of
the 420 who saw the film, 83
percent gave it highly favorable
ratings and 84 percent said they
would recommend it.
However, everyone is not
raving about the movie.
Because of the drug use in the
movie, the Rating Board of the
Motion Picture Association of
America labeled the film with
an ""R"" rating.  Brown said this
will, ""prevent the anti-drug film
from reaching the young
people who need it.""  But he
challenged the Board on their
decision and convinced them to
change the rating to PG-13.
Brown told Atlanta University
Center students of the new
rating when he spoke to them at
King's Chapel, which is a part
of Morehouse College, last
month.  He explained his Buy
Freedom philosophy and
encouraged the students to take
part in it.

Be Sure to Vote
1988. An election year. Atlanta University Center. Does
more need to be said? Of course.
Before the Mayflower and after European takeover and
integration the influence of the Black minority remains a key
element in our society. At first, we were not considered a part of
the voting population, let alone allowed to become a part of the
officeholding population. Barely considered, always 
overlooked, we refused to be nonexistent in the political arena
that shaped our world.
Through trials and tribulations, bewildering bloodshed and
the loss of many lives we gained the right to vote. We also
gained a sense of pride and Black power.
The Black power and pride came when Blacks lined up at the 
polls and made a contribution to the ballot box. The Black 
power and pride showed when Blacks started holding local,
state and national offices from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The
Black power and pride flourished when Jesse Louis Jackson 
made history at the 1988 Democratic National Convention.
But somewhere between gaining the right to vote and 
Jackson's historical endeavor the power and the pride were
somewhat removed from the Black voting population. Has our 
urge to more than merely exist ceased? Have we simply put our 
power and pride in our back pockets and decided to sit on our 
assets?
Whatever the case may be, those lives that were lost must
surely be finding a way to turn over in their graves. For many
students here in the Atlantic University Center, this will be the
first time casting a vote for a presidential candidate. For the
sake of our ancestors as well as our descendants, we need to 
take advantage of our opportunity to vote.
Consider the Black in South Africa who still cannot vote.
Consider the potential power of the Black influence when you
vote. Consider the changes you can bring about. Consider who 
will become president if you don't vote. Consider what it feels
like to leave the polls. Consider what it must have felt like to not
be able to go near the polls. Consider the issues and the
candidates before you vote. 
The strength of a nation is diversified through its people. The
only way we will continue to exist as a people is to strengthen 
our potential powers by exercising our voting powers.
Okay, Jackson is not the democratic nominee for president.
Many people are using this as an incentive not to vote for a 
presidential candidate. This will defeat our purpose. When we 
don't vote now we make it more difficult for Jackson to be
nominated tomorrow. The more contributions we make, the
less likely history is to repeat itself. 
Being registered to vote helps, but voting is what actually 
counts. A trip to the polls is less expensive than a trip to the 
mall.

 Welfare Reform At Last
By Gary J. Maddox
Contributing Writer
What started in 1935 as a temporary pension
program for widows, then expanded into an
income maintenance program for millions of 
unemployed women with children, may now 
become a job program that enable people
to get off heir ""butts"" altogether.
By a vote of 93 to 3, the Senate agreed to 
revamp the nation's welfare laws in the hope of
ending the cycle of dependency on support given
by the government. This giant step will be 
considered the first major change since the 
1930s. It is definitely time something was done. 
The idea behind this great decision is to get
people off welfare by getting them into jobs. The 
bill requires that states provide job training, 
education and work for able-bodied welfare
recipients, except those with children under the 
age of 3. To ensure the change of handouts to
breadwinning, states would have to provide 
child care for nine months and Medicaid for up
to a year after the parent gets a job.
 How is the new bill different from the one 
amended? Will it really make that big of a 
difference? The new bill remedies much of the 
past criticism of the old federal program.
Two-parent families, according to the new law, 
cannot receive benefits. The new measure gives
benefits only to families in which both parents 
are unemployed. No longer will there be an
incentive for a father, (as seen in many Black 
families), to leave the home. As a matter of fact, 
the incentive has changed gears for the better.
The new bill will get delinquent fathers to pay
their fare share of child support by requiring 
employers to deduct supporting payments from 
their wages.
In 1986, the last year reported concerning 
welfare recipients, the Department of Health
and Human Services provided $18 billion in
AFDC grants to states, which distributed funds 
to 3.8 million families, most of them headed by 
single women.
Will the old stereotype of welfare recipients be
broken? Will the notion of welfare as a narcotic 
to most poor families be done away with? Most 
of the people on welfare are young, unwed 
mothers who lack a high school diploma and 
work experience. They account for almost half
of the welfare recipients. If there so called
mothers lack high school diplomas, and not to
mention work experience, how can the 
government provide them with employment?
Does the new bill contradict itself? One would
think so.
The flip side of the coin would suggest the new 
bill a panacea in disguise. For those recipients
who may require assistance after a divorce or the 
loss of a job, the new bill is excellent.
What accomplishments will actually be made
by the state? The unforseen truth awaits. If the 
welfare program, old and new, is a ""perpetuating
reliance on the government,"" as stated by many
politicians, then it is not an accomplishment at
all. If it works by the turn of the century, we will 
definitely have a changed social landscape. 
Better late than never. It is not when, but
whether."

Alumin Prexy Outlines Goals

By Tracey Hicks
Staff Writer

Kevin Hughley, a 1981 graduate, has been elected as president of the Atlanta Chapter of the Clark College Alumni Association.  hugely said, he feels by getting involved with the alumni association, he can give back to Clark, what Clark has given to him.

Hughley hopes that Clark graduates will become more involved in the alumni association.  One of his goals is to increase the alumni membership.  ""We need to create a good information network.  There are so many Clark graduates living the Atlanta area and are unaware of what is happening on campus,"" he said.

Hughley feels that alumni play an important role as far as financial support and recruiting students students to the school.

A second goal of Hugley's is to ""help the Admissions Office in the area of recruitment.  I think that every Clark graduate should be a recruiter for this great institution.  Seventy percent of the college student are women and 30 percent are men.  We need to go out there and get more men so there can be a balance.""

His third goal is to have fundraisers to increase the amount of money that Clark receives.  One way that this will be done is with the ""Salute to Black Colleges.""  All of the Atlanta University Center schools will get together and raise money which will be dispersed among the four schools.  The second event will feature the Philharmonic Society and this event will happen in November or December of this year.

""I feel that I should have a special relationship with the students.  It's important that I communicate to the students how important it is to come to and all the board of trustees on this great move!""

By being involved with the senior citizens and young people, Hughley feels that he has learned to have patience with people and become more committed with people.  By being the alumni president, he feels that he will be able to work with the students and the alumni together.

""People have forgotten how to listen.  I am a visionary.  You must have a dream and be a doer,"" he said.


Clark and get a quality education.  Twice yearly, the alumni and the students will get together and the students will get together and discuss problems the students might have -- whether it is financial, social or drugs.  I would also like to stress how important it is for sororities and fraternities to be leaders on campus.""

""I think it was a great idea for Clark and Atlanta University to come together so both schools will excel in educational excellence.  I commend Dr. (Thomas) Cole (president)


It's 'A Different World'
By Terri L. Shell
Staff Writer

Freshmen orientation is an induction into ""a different world.""  Just like in the television program by that name, college opens a new frontier for young minds to conquer and to have little fun.

During this impressionable time, Clark College offers numerous activities to instill spirit.  The Freshman Class this year is comprised of 685 students.

Eric Fonza of Springfield, Ill, said, ""I didn't mind getting up at 4 a.m. to cheer for school spirit because my older sister warned me.  Although, wearing the C.C. visor was taken too far.  Those guides tried to dunk me in the fountains once.  But overall it was a lot of fun.""

The freshmen cheered in the VWH Gym, caught buses over to Six Flags, partied in the VWH pool and formed a freshmen-only talent show.  ""Most of the activities gave us a chance to get to know each other.  We learned everyone's likes and dislikes.  Participating in everything was worth it,"" said Monica Hill of Dallas, Texas.

Clark also offered their freshmen an opportunity to explore the academic world.  Seminars were scheduled for career advisement by the chairperson's of each department, for security by the AUC Public Safety Force, for academic policies and procedures by acting Dean of Faculty and Instruction, for an update on the status of Blacks in America by the director of the Policy Center and for numerous informal gatherings in clusters to discuss study habits and tour the library.

Lisa Mathews of St. Louis, Mo. said, ""We were given pamphlets about different interesting things, but some meetings were long.

Not just the seminars but the testing was drawn out as well.  In most cases, they didn't start on time,"" she added.

Placement testing is a not-so-fun part of the college world yet necessary.  The academic departments administer detail tests to find out if its recruits have the basic skills to enter college level.

After dealing with the academic arena, the freshmen were given a dose of culture.  They were intrigued by a seminar on Clark history and tradition and illustrious alumni.  They were also introduced to the world renowned Clark College Jazz Orchestra.

What more could a person entering such a diverse atmosphere want from an environment, the only missing link is sleep.


Residents Picket Area Supermarket
By Carl Cloud
Staff Writer

Area residents recently began picketing Five Stars Supermarket and Deli for what they called ""mistreatment of Blacks"" by a Korean family that runs the business.

The move was sparked by an incident last month when a John Hope Homes resident was allegedly cheated out of money while purchasing a money order in the store that is located less than a black from the school's campus of 653 Fair St., S.W.  The elderly woman, whose name has not been released to the public, supposedly cashed a Social Security check.  After that transaction the woman apparently asked for a $90 money order.  And, when the clerk asked for $91, an argument ensued as to whether it had been paid.  A witness for the woman claims she saw one of the clerks pocket $100.  Police were called and the clerk has been charged with theft by taking.  The owners of the store claim to have filed a countersuit and to have a witness for their defense.

Many Atlanta University Center students are regular customers at the supermarket because of its proximity to the campuses.  However, every student interviewed as a result of this incident said that the clerks in the store are not highly regarded for their attitudes.  They also expressed dissatisfaction about high prices and the quality of produce at the store.

""Once I bought some chicken at the store which I knew I would regret and sure enough when I brought it back to my room it smelled like it had been dead for two years,"" said Tim Rhoades, a Clark student.  I don't like anything about the store.

Other students complained of the influx of Korean families who open stores in mainly poor Black neighborhoods and proceed to rob the residents with high prices.

""I really get tired of Koreans coming into our areas and just taking over.  It seems like they only move into poor Black neighborhoods, then they talk down to our people, then close their stores at the end of the day and ride into Buckhead to their nice homes,"" said Dominique Barial, a Morehouse student.  ""Black people should have picketed that stores as soon as they moved in.  I always go out of my way to go to Stegall's store before I go into any of these Korean stores around here.""

The picketing has been going on several days with no apparent end in sight."

Tyrone Brooks:
Blacks Should Vote Republican
By Lisa Harriston
Managing Editor

All people should be bi-partisan voters in the upcoming 1988 presidential elections and not restrict themselves to one political party, State Rep. Tyrone Brooks, Democrat, told members of the George Black Republican Council and the Georgia Republican Party last week at an evening engagement to support and label Republican presidential candidate George Bush as the ""better candidate.""

He said, ""A person should vote for the candidate, whether Democratic or Republican, that he feels will do the best job.""  He continued to say that he, as a Black man, refuses to be enslaved by anyone and that although he is a registered Democrat, he has occasionally supported Republican candidates as he saw it beneficial to his needs.

According to Rep. Brooks, the Democratic party is usually the choice for minority groups; however, Blacks will vote otherwise if they are informed about the alternate party.  He told Republican candidates running for any office that they must reach out to Blacks in their community if they want their support.  ""Don't assume that all Black people are going to vote Democrat.  If you go to the Black community, they will listen.  You must go to them and explain your program.""  This gathering illustrated Rep. Brooks' idea of the Republicans reaching out to Blacks in their community.  It took place at Paschal's Hotel, which exists in one of Southwest Atlanta's urban neighborhoods.

Some main objectives of the Georgia Black Republicans Council are to inform the Black community throughout Georgia of the political process, to encourage and assist Blacks to seek public office and to create a program which will educate and recruit Black Republicans.

A history of Blacks in the Republican party was given, which provided information of how this organization was the initial ""voice"" that spoke out for the Black society.  Bonnie Guiton, Assistant Secretary of Vocational and Adult Education, delivered the keynote address for the evening and requested that Blacks join her in supporting George Bush.  She spoke of her personal affiliation with him and said she is aware of his many political accomplishments.

Reiterating the significance of the GOP's history, Ms. Guiton pointed out that ""The Republican party did not abandon Black America,"" but that ""Black American abandoned the Republican party.""  She urged her fellow Black constituents to reinvolve themselves and asked them to escape the party which often times misrepresents them.  She said speaking of the Republican party, ""If it's not what you have it to be, then you get in and help make change.""

Patrick Jones, a junior at the University of Miami, Ohio and former GOP intern, addressed the issue of Republican youth involvement.  He gave statistics on the progress of Black Youth situations since the beginning of President Reagan's terms in office.  He said Black youths of today are brought up to think Democratically, but that they should go beyond the norm and explore what else is in the political world.  He said, ""The challenge to Blacks is not to mold themselves into one party, but to weigh the alternatives.""  He continued to say that the more Blacks are involved in the Republican party, the more the Republican party can represent and benefit the Black community.


Students Study Abroad
By Jacqueline Reid
Entertainment Editor

For six years this summer, 20-year-old Tyronda Williams was forbidden to speak, read or listen to the English language.

""I couldn't even listen to Jesse Jackson's speech at the (Democratic National) Convention because it was in English,"" Ms. Williams said.

As part of Clark College's Study Abroad Program, Ms. Williams studied at Laval University in Quebec, Canada, where students allowed to communicate only in the French language.  But she said that missing Jackson's speech was a sacrifice worth making in exchange for everything learned this summer.

Ms. Williams was among three Clark students who had the opportunity to enhance there education and earn credits toward graduation by studying abroad this summer.  Cheryl Johnson studied at the University of Seville in Spain and Ramona Houston traveled to the University of Idiomas in Mexico.

The Study Aboard Program encourages and supports students to explore foreign cultures by providing financial assistance.  Selected students are awarded grants ranging from $500-5000, depending on the expense of the program and the students' needs.

Students have a choice of over 1,900 programs in over 850 countries.  All of the programs are hosted by various universities are in the United States.  Since the program began in 1967, more than 200 Clark students have traveled in England, Spain, France, Japan, Sweden, Yugoslavia, Nicaragua, Kenya, Egypt, Haiti, Colombia (South America), Mexico, the Dominican Republican and Canada.

The committee on Studies Abroad, headed by Paul B. McGirt who helped initiate the program, evaluates each applicant and chooses those who meet the qualifications of the program.

To qualify, students must first receive admission to the U.S. institution hosting the program.  Then the student must meet the academic and personal qualifications outlined by the studies abroad committee.

Although students chosen this summer were all language majors, this is not a requirement for the program.  The committee stresses that all Clark students are eligible for participation irrespective of major, minor or career goals.

In fact, Velisa Smith, a mass communications major, is studying in London this semester under a program sponsored by Syracuse University's journalism department.

Participating students may receive full credit for all courses taken abroad if such courses satisfy requirements for graduation.

According to McGirt, the majority of the students report that they had a wonderful experience.  Some like Ms. Williams said that being among foreign students taught her a lot about her identity as a Black American.  Ms. Houston said she stayed with a Mexican family who made her feel right at home.

""I just loved my Mexican family.  Living with them was just like being part of the family.  It's my most cherished memory,"" said Ms. Houston.

Dr. Robinson Visits China
Continued From Page 1

Robinson and the other delegation members were able to interact with people for all backgrounds and cultures.

As a guest in China, Dr. Robinson was afforded the opportunity to meet with various Chinese officials.  Although the meetings with the officials were informative and interesting, Dr. Robinson's interaction with the citizens of the more remote parts of China was especially memorable.

""Some of the areas we visited had never before been visited by Americans,"" said Dr. Robinson, ""So we got a lot of stares.""

The young children were especially curious to see the black members of the delegation, Dr. Robinson commented, but the delegation was treated kindly by everyone they met, especially their hosts.

Dr. Robinson participated in various seminars, lectures, and conferences, and through her contact with her Chines contemporaries, she learned that music is basically the same worldwide.

""I noticed that the music of the Chinese is very similar to American music in terms of theme,"" noted Dr. Robinson.  ""They sing about love, home, family, happiness and sadness just like Americans do.""

But the trip was not all business.  Dr. Robinson was able to able to enjoy the sights of China, and it was one experience she will never forget.

""I feel as though I was in another world,"" said Dr. Robinson.  ""There was so much to see and so much to do."" 

Among the many monuments and tourist attractions that Dr. Robinson saw, the one that had the greatest impact on her was the Great Wall of China.

""Being on top of the Great Wall was magnificent,"" said Dr. Robinson.  ""It is the only thing on earth that can be seen from the moon.  And when you think of it in that sense, it is even more amazing to be able to say that I actually saw it,"" she continued.

Although the trip was a wonderful and exciting educational experience, Dr. Robinson did find some aspects of the trip somewhat difficult.

""Each person in the delegation was responsible for his or her own expenses,"" said Dr. Robinson.  ""So the trip was quite expensive.""

In addition, traveling from place to place was lengthy and often difficult.  During some periods, the delegation members had to do a lot of climbing.

""You had to be in good shape in order to do the climbing and walking,"" said Dr. Robinson.  ""So it was rough at times.""

But despite those limited hardships, Dr. Robinson believes that this trip was one of the best things that has ever happened to her.  She has made new friends; friendships that she believes will last a lifetime.  But most importantly, she has come to believe that understanding the people of other countries is a key to establishing peace in the world.

""People all over the world are more alike than they are different,"" noted Dr. Robinson.  ""By learning about the people of different nations we can learn to understand them.  And that is an excellent way to promote peace in this world.""

Career Day Conference Attracts Many Students
By JACQUELINE REID
Entertainment Editor

Atlanta University Center
students had the opportunity to
meet with representatives from
142 companies and agencies in
the Woodruff Library last
week, during the 22nd Annual
Career Day Conference.
The conference activities,
sponsored by the AUC Career
Placement Center, allowed
students to build contacts with
perspective employers.
Participating representatives
set up booths from where they
provided information about
their companies and advised
students on job seeking 
techniques.
The conference was very well
attended by students. The
Placement Center estimates
about 2,000 students were
present.
The companies and agencies
represented were from all parts
of the country. These organizations
are selected by the
Placement Center, from a list
of recruiters that are interested
in hiring Liberal Arts students.
The companies are then invited
to attend the conference and
are charged a small fee which
covers the cost of the
conference.
The agencies in attendance
were representatives of the
United States government.
Agencies such as the U.S.
Coast Guard, have job
opportunities related to several
majors, but Lieutenant Stan
Douglas said students are
unaware of these
opportunities.
""Most students don't know
what we are really about. We
are making efforts to expose
ourselves to the community,
especially the minority
community. We hope to spark
an interest in what the Coast
Guard has to offer,"" Douglas
said.
Other agencies present
include the U.S. Navy and the
Central Intelligence Agency,
C.I.A.
Throughout the day, most
representatives abtained
resumes and screened students
for call back interviews.
Interviews with participating
companies and agencies began
Monday and will continue
through the rest of the school
year, excluding holidays.
Students may request an
interview by signing up in the
Placement Center. Interviews
are open to AUC students who
are undergraduate juniors and
seniors, or graduate students,
whether or not they attended
the conference.
Although this day was not
intended for official job
recruitment, students were
expected to be very professional,
according to the
Center's Director of Placement
for Clark College, Georgia
Jones.
""This is the first contact
students get with these
companies. That is why I
wanted them to put their best
food forward,"" Ms. Jones said.
The majority of students
dressed in business attire and
presented their resumes to the
representatives. Joyce Russau
of General Motors said the
majority of the students who
inquired about her company
were very impressive.
""About 90 percent of the
students we have seen were well
prepared. They had resumes,
asked questions and knew
exactly what we were looking
for,"" Ms. Russau said.
One recruiter who has
attended similar conferences at
predominately white institutions
said that AUC students
are well equipped to compete
with these students in the job
market.
""There is not a big difference
between these (AUC) students
and the students at white
colleges. Many of the white
students may have a broader
range of experiences because of
family income and influences,
but other than that the students
are pretty much the same,"" she
said.
Participating students took
advantage of the opportunities
the conference had to offer.
They manouvered from booth
to booth seeking advice and
information, and trying to
make a good impression. Many
followed a handout which
listed all of the companies and
agencies along with a brief
description of each. This saved
time for students who knew
exactly what type of job or
internship they wanted.
For example, Leisha Whitaker,
a senior Accounting
major at Clark, said she had
talked with all of the major
accounting firms and passed
around her resume to them.
Darel Hargrove, a senior at
Morehouse College, said he
was looking for a job with the
basics that most students want:
a great location, opportunities
for upward mobility and lots of
money.

Students discuss employment opportunities with business professional during Career Day Activities. 

Part of Music Professors Delegation: 
Dr. Robinson Visits China
By Betty Waiters
Staff Writer
For many of us, the opportunity to visit distant countries or travel across the world will probably never arise. After all, we usually think of the world travelers as being entertainers, politicians, or wealthy aristocrats. But recently, a new group was inducted into the category of world travelers: music professors. And one of Clark College's instructors was fortunate enough to be included in that new category. 
Dr. Florence C. Robinson, Fuller E. Callaway Professor of Music and the chairwoman of the Division of Humanities and the Department of Music at Clark, spent 3 1/2 weeks this summer in the People Republic of China as a member of a delegation of university musicology professors. The delegations was composed of music professors from across the country, and according to Dr. Robinson, it was an honor to be selected. 
""This was the opportunity of a lifetime,"" said Dr. Robinson. ""I consider it a great honor to have been chosen to participate in a program of this magnitude.""
The delegation consisted of 19 music professors and their spouses, and the trip was organized by People to People International. 
Formed in 1957 by President Dwight Eisenhower, People to People International was organized to promote friend-
Dr. Florence Robinson
ship and understanding between United States citizens and their global counterparts. Since its formation, People to People International has been successful in accomplishing its goals, and each year a different group of Americans is chosen to participate. 
""In the past, scientists, engineers, and many other groups were selected to visit and study other cultures,"" said Dr. Robinson. ""This year, music professors were the selected group.""
The Chinese Association for the Advancement of International Friendship, an organization based on the same principles as those of People to People International, invited the delegation to visit its country. From Aug 11 to Sept 5, the group visited several cities in China and surrounding areas, including Beijing, Hohhot, Mongolia, Nanning, Shaoguan and Guangzhou. In addition, the delegation members also made stops in Hong Kong, Seoul, and Tokyo. 
The purpose of the trip was to give delegation members a chance to study the music of minority cultures of China and to share American music with them. And according to Dr. Robinson, there are several minority cultures in China. 
""When most people think of China, they think that there is only one group of people in that country,"" said Dr. Robinson. ""But, in actuality, there are 57 different people in China.""
The most widely known people are the Han, but Dr.

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH

ROSA LOUISE PARKS is nationally recognized as the ""Mother of the Modern Day Civil
Rights Movement"" in America.  Her refusal to surrender her seat to a white male passenger on a Montgomery, Alabama bus, December 1, 1955, triggered a wave of protest December 5,1955, that reverberated throughout the United States.  Her quiet, courageous act changed America, its view of black people and redirected the course of history.

Mrs. Parks was born Rosa Louise McCauley, February 4, 1913 in Tuskegee, Alabama. She
was the first child of James and Leona Edwards McCauley.  Her brother, Sylvester
McCauley, now deceased, was born August 20, 1915.  Later, the family moved to Pine Level, Alabama where Rosa was reared and educated in the rural school. 

When she completed her education in Pine Level at age eleven, her mother, Leona, enrolled her in Montgomery Industrial School for Girls (Miss White's School for Girls), a private institution.  After finishing Miss White's School, she went on to Alabama State Teacher's College High School.  However, she was unable to graduate with her class because of the illness of her grandmother Rose Edwards and later her death.

As Rosa prepared to return to Alabama State, her mother also became ill.  Therefore, she
continued to take care of their home and care for her mother while her brother Sylvester, worked outside of the home.  Rosa received her high school diploma in 1934, after her marriage to Raymond Parks, December 18, 1932.

Raymond, now deceased, born in Wedowee, Alabama, Randolph County, February 12, 1903, received little formal education due to racial segregation.  He was a self educated person with the assistance of his mother, Geri Parks.  His immaculate dress and his thorough knowledge of domestic affairs and current events made most think he was college educated.  He supported and encouraged Rosa's desire to complete her formal education.

Mr. Parks was an early activist in the effort to free the ""Scottsboro Boys"", a celebrated case in the 1930's.  Together , Raymond and Rosa worked in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP's) programs.  He was an active member and she served as secretary and later youth leader of the local branch.  At the time of her arrest, she was preparing for a major youth conference.

After the arrest of Rosa Parks, black people of Montgomery and sympathizers of other races organized and promoted a boycott of the city bus line that lasted 381 days.  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was appointed the spokesperson for the Bus Boycott and taught nonviolence to all participants.  Contingent with the protest in Montgomery, others took shape throughout the south and the country.  They took form as sit-ins, eat-ins, swim-ins and similar causes.  Thousands of courageous people joined the ""protest"" to demand equal rights for all people.

Since 1965, Mrs. Parks has been employed by Congressman John Conyers, First
Congressional District of Michigan.  In February, 1987 she began the Rosa and Raymond
Parks Institute for Self Development.  The purpose is to motivate and direct the ""average"" youth not targeted by other programs to achieve their highest potential.  Rosa Parks sees the energy of young people as a real force for change.  It is among her most treasured themes of human priorities as she speaks to young people of all ages at schools, colleges and national organizations around the country.

Mrs. Parks has received ten honorary doctorate degrees, hundreds of plaques, certificates, citations, awards and keys to several cities.  Among them are the NAACP's Spingarn Medal, the UAW's Social Justice Award, the Martin Luther King, Jr. Non-Violent Peace Prize and most recently in May of 1987, the Roger Joseph Prize with a cash award of ten thousand dollars, from the Hebrew Union College.

A quiet exemplification of courage, dignity and determination; Rosa Parks is a symbol to all Americans to remain free."

assess the effectiveness of academic programs, including those
offered through continuing education departments/divisions.

Dr. Louis Phillips was instrumental in the development of
Principles of Good Practice in Continuing Education, the report
of the Council on the Continuing Education Unit published in
1984. Dr. Phillips will address the issue of building
individual participant performance criteria to be used to assess
overall program success.

To register for this program, please complete the form below.
Should you have questions about the program, please contact
Theresa Bryant, Columbus College, 404/568-2023 (GIST 251-2023).

Dear Rosa:

Once again, I am pleased and proud to wish a Happy Birthday to my
esteemed coworker and friend.  Although your real 75th birthday
has passed, every day of our association in the past twenty or so 
years has been a celebration for me-- of your courage and dignity,
of your commitment and the legacy to freedom and justice which 
you live.

The Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development is a 
great culmination of your life and the ideals that have become
synonymous with your name.  If the future, as I believe, is in 
the hearts and minds of our young people, then those who will be
associated with the Institute will have their finest influence
and their best example in you.

Words do not adequately express what you mean to us--in Detroit
and throughout this country--but I speak from my heart when I
wish you every success in your newest endeavor, and peace and
happiness in every aspect of your life.  You are an inspiration
to me, and I am proud to call you my friend.

Happy Birthday.

With Much Love and Respect,
John.

Introducing
The Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute
BACKGROUND
The Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self
Development was incorporated in February of 1987 to
fulfill the dreams of two individuals who committed
their lives to Civil Rights; Rosa and Raymond Parks.
Raymond Parks (1903-1977), and Rosa McCauley
born in 1913, grew up in a period that was difficult
for Blacks.  There was legalized segregation,
caretaker attitudes and many times, dehumanizing
treatment for people of color.
Raymond, a barber and self taught individual with
minimum formal education, was active in trying to
free the Scottsboro Boys, encouraging Blacks to vote
and sharing his talents with the community.  Rosa, a
domestic, a seamstress and a civic leader who
finished high school after her marriage to Raymond,
began the Montgomery Bus Boycott by refusing to
give her seat to a white male passenger on a
Montgomery, Alabama bus.
As the youth leader of the local branch of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People (NAACP), Rosa, with Raymond's support,
tried to motivate and stimulate youth and adults to
reach their highest potential.
Goal setting was demonstrated in Rosa Park's youth
by her mother, a school teacher, Leona McCauley
(1888-1979).  As a role model, she was an
inspiration to both Rosa and Raymond.  Mrs.
McCauley maintained an aura of pride, dignity
and courage.
PURPOSE
The Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self
Development will provide unique programs to train
future and present leaders.  The Institute will
outreach to youth and young adults not typically
singled out for special programs.  They will be
challenged to create fresh perspectives, examine new
approaches, and improve their quality of life.
Rosa and Raymond Parks have provided a legacy of
dignity with pride, courage with perseverance and
power with discipline. These concepts will be
researched, analyzed, and translated into
marketable skills.  
Through mutual respect and a blending of
generations; the vitality of youth, the experience
of adults and the wisdom of seniors, the Institute
will establish a unique, and favorable
learning environment. 
The Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self
Development represents ideas uniquely suited for
today, ideas that can shape a better future.
PROGRAM FOCUS
A community center environment will provide a
pleasant atmosphere to share and study unique
approaches to self development.  Our faculty of skilled
retirees, interns and professional educators will use
creative techniques to interpret civil rights history,
healthful life style improvements and motivational
training.  The Institute will invite leading experts,
innovative educators and talented researchers as
visiting faculty.
Communication skills, economic growth skills,
political awareness and health awareness will be
stressed as necessities for personal growth.  New
approaches to the basics which ignite the Rosa and
Raymond Parks spirit of dignity, courage and
commitment is fundamental to the philosophy of
the Institute.
The Institute's effective and creative approaches to
education will provide the marketable skills to
transform it's students into contributing
productive citizens.

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH

ROSA LOUISE PARKS is nationally recognized as the ""Mother of the Modern Day Civil
Rights Movement"" in America.  Her refusal to surrender her seat to a white male passenger
on a Montgomery, Alabama bus, December 1, 1955, triggered a wave of protest December 5,
1955, that reverberated throughout the United States.  Her quiet, courageous act changed
America, its view of black people and redirected the course of history.  

Mrs. Parks was born Rosa Louise McCauley, February 4, 1913 in Tuskegee, Alabama.  She
was the first child of James and Leona Edwards McCauley.  Her brother, Sylvester
McCauley, now deceased, was born August 20, 1915.  Later, the family moved to Pine Level,
Alabama where Rosa was reared and educated in the rural school.

When she completed her education in Pine Level at age eleven, her mother, Leona, enrolled
her in Montgomery Industrial School for Girls (Miss White's School for Girls), a private
institution.  After finishing Miss White's School, she went on to Alabama State Teacher's
College High School.  However, she was unable to graduate with her class because of the
illness of her grandmother Rose Edwards and later her death.

As Rosa prepared to return to Alabama State, her mother also became ill.  Therefore, she
continued to take care of their home and care for her mother while her brother Sylvester,
worked outside of the home.  Rosa received her high school diploma in 1934, after her
marriage to Raymond Parks, December 18, 1932.

Raymond, now deceased, born in Wedowee, Alabama, Randolph County, February 12, 1903,
received little formal education due to racial segregation.  He was a self educated person with
the assistance of his mother, Geri Parks. His immaculate dress and his thorough knowledge
of domestic affairs and current events made most think he was college educated. He
supported and encouraged Rosa's desire to complete her formal education.

Mr. Parks was an early activist in the effort to free the ""Scottsboro Boys,"" a celebrated case
in the 1930s.  Together, Raymond and Rosa worked in the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People (NAACP's) programs. He was an active member and she
served as secretary and later youth leader of the local branch. At the time of her arrest, she
was preparing for a major youth conference.

After the arrest of Rosa Parks, black people of Montgomery and sympathizers of other races
organized and promoted a boycott of the city bus line that lasted 381 days. Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr. was appointed the spokesperson for the Bus Boycott and taught non-violence
to all participants. Contingent with the protest in Montgomery, others took shape
throughout the south and the country. They took form as sit-ins, swim-ins and
similar causes. Thousands of courageous people joined the ""protest"" to demand equal rights
for all people.

Since 1965, Mrs. Parks has been employed by Congressman John Conyers, First
Congressional District of Michigan. In February, 1987 she began the Rosa and Raymond
Parks Institute for Self Development. The purpose is to motivate and direct the ""average""
youth not targeted by other programs to achieve their highest potential. Rosa Parks sees the
energy of young people as a real force for change. It is among her most treasured themes of 
human priorities as she speaks to young people of all ages at schools, colleges and national
organizations around the country.

Mrs. Parks has received ten honorary doctorate degrees, hundreds of plaques, certificates,
citations, awards, and keys to several cities.  Among them are the NAACP's Spingarn Medal,
the UAW's Social Justice Award, the Martin Luther King, Jr. Non-Violent Peace Prize and
most recently in May of 1987, the Roger Joseph Prize with a cash award of ten thousand
dollars, from the Hebrew Union College.

A quiet exemplification of courage, dignity, and determination; Rosa Parks is a symbol to all
Americans to remain free.

A.M.E. Christian Educators Plan New Directions

Responding to a call for Action Toward
the Year 2000 by the Rev. Dr. Kenneth H. 
Hill, executive Director of the Department 
of Christian Education in the African Methodist 
Episcopal Church, Christian
Educators from nearly all of the Thirteen
(13) Continental  Episcopal Districts attended
a three day Conference, April 30-May 
2, 1992 in Nashville, to fashion new directions
in A.M.E.CChristian Education.
During the conference, which carried
the central theme ""Drinking From Our
Well"", pictorial plaques of the first three
directors of the Department of Christian
Education of the A.M.E.C were unveiled
in a well attended dedicatory ceremony
hold at the Sunday School Union office
building. The General Conference of the 
Church established Christian Education as 
a connectional department in 1936 when
the Rev. Dr. Solomon S. Morris, Sr. was 
elected the first General Secretary and
served until 1956. The Rev. Dr. Andrew 
White, who had assisted Dr. Morris for 
many years, continued the work that 
ended in 1980. The Rev. Dr. Edgar L. Mack
served the department until his death in
1991.
    The General Officers, among the many
guest, participating in the ceremony that 
honored the past chief executives of the
Christian Education Department were; Dr.
Jamye C. Williams, Editor, A.M.E.C.
Review; Dr. Robert Reid, Editor, A.M.E.
Christian Recorder and the Rev. Anderson 
Todd, General Secretary, A.M.E.C. 
Pension Department. Among the other
dignitaries were; Dr. Andrew White, Mrs.
Edgar L. Mack; Dr. George L. Blackwell,
retiring General Secretary of Christian
Education for the A.M.E. Zion Church
and Dorothy Savage, National Director of 
Ministry in Christian Education for the
National Council of Churches.
    Bishop Vernon R. Byrd, Chair of the 
Connectional Commission on Christian
Education and Presiding Prelate of the 
Thirteenth Episcopal District was the key
note messenger for the Evening Worship
Services held at the Greater Bethel AMEC
where the Rev. C. W. Fugh is Pastor.
Bishop Byrd Challenged the Christian
educators to exhibit new life and rise above
all situations as they worked toward their
goals for the Church, (John 11:25). In addition
to the dignitaries who were present
at the dedicatory ceremony, Dr. Forrest
Harris, Executive Director of the Kelly
Miller Smith Institute and Associate Dean
of the Vanderbilt University School of
Divinity; Mr. Tom Willhite, Dir. of Support
Services for the Middle Tennessee
Council of the Boy Scouts of America and 
Mr. Al Benneworth, Scout Master for
Troop No. 42 of the Boy Scouts were also
on hand to hear the message of the
Presiding Bishop. Four Scouts from the 
Ram Patrol in Troop No. 42 of the Middle
Tennessee Council BSA performed as
the Color Guard for the Worship Services.

DRINKING FROM OUR WELL
    In a spiritually moving message, Dr.
Kenneth H. Hill, the fourth Executive
Secretary of the connectional Department
of Christian Education, launched the
workshop portion of the conference by anchoring
his administrative goals and objectives
in Scripture, (Prov. 5:15), ""As
African Methodist look toward the year
2000 and beyond, we must first Drink
From Our Own Well and he refreshed for
our mighty journey of Christian education"",
Dr. Hill said. ""Our many prayers,
our rich history, our liturgies, our songs
are filled with the contributions made by
our founding Fathers and Mothers of the 
A.M.E. Church. Richard Allen was not
only filled with the Holy Spirit, he was
equally motivated for the liberation of his
people who were in bondage; Jarena Lee
understood that God was no respector of

persons and accepted her call and became
our first woman preacher in the A.M.E.
Church; Wilberforce University is the first
major University founded by African
Americans in 1856, its founder and first
Presiden, Daniel Alexander Payne, has left
a deep legacy in our well; and many trails
were burned with the pioneer spirit of
William Paul Quinn establishing churches
in the Mid-West and the South along with
Daniel Coker and Henry McNeal Turner"".
Dr. Hill continued.
    Further, Dr. Hill introduced his vision
of ministry within the Department of
Christian Education. He clearly stated that
general ministry is inclusive of baptized
Christians. From among the whole people
of Allen, some persons are Called by
God to particular services of ministry.
Everyone is Not Called to pastor, but
everyone is Called to Ministry.

MINISTRY IN CHRISTIAN 
EDUCATION
The A.M.E. Church recognizes the
following specialized ministries in Christian
education: Youth Ministry, Leadership
Ministry, Teaching Ministry, Scouting
Ministry and Writing Ministry. Leading by
example, Dr. Hill then took a few
moments to introduce his newly published
book, 'Drinking From Our Well; Foundations
for Christian Education in the
African Methodist Episcopal Church'
    Conferees were then treated with
presentation by consultants discussing the
several ministries: The Boy Scouts were
represented by Mr. Russ Doyle, District
Executive for the Nashboro District
(Inner-City) of Nashville, The Middle
Tennessee Council of the Boy Scouts of
America. The Girl Scouts discussion
period was led by Mrs. Mary R. Dunn,
Director of Field Services, the
Cumberland Valley Girl Scout Council of
The Girl Scouts of America. Leadership
Ministry was chaired by Dr. Louis Charles
Harvey, President of the Payne Theological
Seminary, Wilberforce, Ohio. This area of
ministry focused on certification programs
for Christian education officers and 
leaders. The certification program when
implemented would be a prescribed course
of study jointly offered by the Department
Christian Education and The Payne
Theological Seminary. The Rev. Ernest
Garrison and Mr. Paul Billingsly introduced
a program that also centered on the 
positives of certification for all workers in
the teaching ministry. The product
presented is now in use in the Michigan
Conference and several other Districts
across the Connectional church. And the
Youth Ministry was enthusiastically
presented by Sis. Roberta Seifuddin of
Detroit. Emphasis was placed on the 
revitalization of Allen Christian Endeavor
and the Richard Allen Youth Councils.
With the plight of youth today, the working
session could not have ended on a better
accord. All conferees then made group
ministry outline presentations for the
development of a general manual covering
the work of Christian education and 
designated manual for the several
ministries as per discipline of the A.M.E.
Church. After deadlines for implementations
were agreed, the three day conference
was closed with prayers of a safe
journey.

THE HOME FORUM
Making Connections The Hard Way

'Our' telephone
was located in a 
hunting cabin a
half mile away
on this quiet
1,200-acre
ranch.  The
delightful news
was that a call to
Baker City, 45
miles away, was
not long distance,
so a call to my
friends cost me
only the ambition
of a half-mile
walk down the
road and the
willingness to sit
in the dark if I
happened to get
there late in the
day.

ONE half mile
didn't seem far
to go to phone a 
friend unless it
was midwinter
and the snow
was deep and cold.  This was a
spring evening, however, at the
end of a long day of spring
cleaning, and the idea of talking
with Val appealed to me.
The children played outdoors
all day as I cleaned.  I heated
water on the wood-burning cook-
stove in big pots, preparatory to 
the dish washing, counter, and
window cleaning I wanted to do.
I hung the living-room rug on
the clothesline in back and beat it
vigorously.  I swept and mopped 
the floors, filled the kerosene
lamps, and washed the lamp 
chimneys.  Then I began heating
water for evening baths.
My husband had been out on
the ranch all day irrigating the
fields by hand, opening up a ditch
here, closing a ditch there, using
a shovel as his only tool as he
walked about in his high rubber
boots.
I went in and out of the house
on my cleaning errands under
the quiet, expansive sky, with only
the sound of the sandhill cranes,
the killdeer, and the children's 
laughing voices to keep me company.
I hadn't been lonely, but 
somehow it seemed good, after
dinner and conversation with the
family, to stroll down the road in
the twilight to phone Val.
""Our"" telephone was
located in a hunting cabin a half mile
away on this quiet 1,200-acre
ranch.  It wasn't our phone, but
our employer had given us full
use of it.  He paid the bill monthly,
then mailed a copy to us so we
could figure our calls and reimburse
him.
The delightful news was that a 
call to Baker City, 45 miles away,
was not long distance, so a call to
my friends cost me only the ambition
of a half-mile walk down the
road and the willingness to sit in
the dark if I happened to get
there late in the day.
None of the buildings in Whitney,
Ore., had electricity.  They
were all remnants of an old lumber
and mining town and were
now incorporated into the big
ranch we worked on.  Sometimes
I took a candle to the ""phone
house.""  Other times I watched
the dusk deepening as I sat
talking and listening.
This particular evening I was

without a candle and had decided 
not to encumber myself with a
flashlight.  I was confident that I
was starting early enough for a
lovely walk, a pleasant talk with
Val, and a stroll back to the house
in time for lamp lighting.
All would have gone just as
planned except that when I
reached the cabin and wound up
the phone (a still workable relic
from who knows when) there was
no response.  I tried a few more
times, hoping to get an answer 
from a Portland operator, who no
doubt would question me about
where Whitney was, ""Is it on the
map?"" and marvel over my living
conditions.  This was a common
occurrence when I called, especially
with new operators.  They
mused over our phone number,
Whitney 111, and wanted to know
how I came to be living in such a place.

But tonight the phone was
definitely dead, and I
stepped onto the front
porch of the cabin and began to
resign myself to my fate of living
in an empty northeastern Oregon
valley without a way to get in
touch, for the moment, except by
letters.  A letter to my friend
would have to be taken to the
nearest town, 13 miles away, to
mail.  Of course one could phone
from there, too.  But a letter
would take a day or two to reach
its destination.  By then perhaps
I'd plan a trip in for groceries,
and why write?
Then I remembered that the
folks from Los Angeles, who lived
up the hill about a mile the other
way, had just had a phone put
into the log cabin they were building.
It was getting dusky-dark by
this time, but I knew my way and
headed up the hill.
Scott and Geralyn were just
pulling out of the drive when I
got there.  They were on their way
to a party in Prairie City, but Scott
said to go on in.
I let myself into the house as
the last light faded from the sky.
Their house was almost as familiar
to me as my own, which was
fortunate since there was no light
left.  I shuffled my way across the
floor, hoping by this method to
avoid any stray trucks or balls the
children might have left.  I found
the phone, but the kerosene lamp
which was usually there had been
moved.  Scott had installed some
new-fangled propane lamps, but
they were new enough that I

didn't know where they were.  Besides,
how did you light them?
I fumbled around in my pockets
and found two paper matches.
Holding the receiver with one
hand, I lit the match and held it
with my dialing hand.  I could
barely see the numbers.  I managed
to dial three numbers before 
the match went out.  Match number
two gave me two numbers
and then I was left in the dark
again.  Wondering to myself why I
didn't give up, I walked my finger
through each number beginning 
with one, counting until I
reached the last two numbers.
The phone rang and I waited
hopefully.  Val answered and 
sounded as far away as the 19th
century.
""Val!"" I shouted.  ""Can you
hear me?""
""Laura? Is that you? Where
are you?""
""Whitney!""
""They have better connections
to Europe than this!"" she yelled,
beginning to rise to the occasion
and obviously enjoying herself.  A
few more shouted sentences left
me leaning against the wall
wearily.  Was it worth it?  I could
see the humor in it, and Val was
having a great time.  I could just
imagine her leaning nonchalantly
on the counter in her well-lighted
kitchen.  I pondered the advantages


of electricity as her laughter
subsided.  After making an appointment
to meet in the park in
town for a picnic with our children,
we hung up.
I left the house and groped my 
way down the hill.  The moon
wasn't up yet, and off in the distance
an owl called and another
responded.  I listened to them
talking in the stillness of the
valley.

SIX years have passed and I
now live in a house with 
phones.  I no longer have to
feel my way through the darkness
or crank up the Portland operator
for a chat with a friend.
A move to Colorado has put us
close to Denver.  On a trip to the 
city for music lessons a few 
months ago my daughters and I 
pulled up behind a man in a business
suit.  He was sitting comfortably
talking on a car phone.  I
marveled that he was able to talk
on the phone about who knows
how many details, keep an eye on
traffic, and be in control all at the
same time.   It was all I could do to
manage the traffic.
But has he ever used a winding
phone?  Who can tell?  The
light changed and he pulled
away.  I guess we'll never know.

The Civil Rights Movement mobilized blacks and
sympathetic whites as nothing had ever done before.
It was not easy. Thousands of people were jailed
because they defied Jim Crow laws. Others were
murdered. Homes and churches were bombed. People
lost their jobs and their homes because they
supported the movement. The movement itself made
mistakes, but the momentum was too great to be
stopped.

The movement probably reached its zenith August
1963, when more than 300,000 people poured into
Washington, D.C. for a massive ""March for Jobs and
Freedom"" that has never been duplicated. A year
later, as representatives of the movement gathered
around him, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the

outlawed discrimination in public accommodations

 life in America.  In the South, they were supported 
by law, and in other sections of the country, custom 
was just as effective as law.  The United States was,
 in fact, an overtly racist country.

The bulk of the Civil Rights struggle throughout
 this period was carried on by the NAACP, which had 
begun chipping away at the root of legalized 
segregation in a series of successful lawsuits.  Its 
major breakthrough came in 1954 when the Supreme 
Court ruled in Brown. vs. Topeka Board of Education 
that discrimination in education was unconstitutional.

Not since the Plessy vs. Ferguson Decision of
 1896, which legalized separate but equal treatment 
for blacks, had there been such a momentous decision
 in a racial case, or one that was to have such
 far-ranging implications.  Today's critics may argue 
that the Brown decision made little real difference,
 that even several decades later, blacks are still 
seeking full equality.  The fallacy in this is that
 without the Brown decision, the legal basis for
 segregation and discrimination would still be in
 place.  The Brown decision was a start, and should
 be viewed as that.

If any one person can be credited with lighting
 the match that set off the first of the Civil Rights
 Movement that was to burn throughout the rest 
of the 1950s and 1960s, it was the humble Montgomery, 
Alabama seamstress, Rosa Parks, who decided on 
December 1, 1955 that because she was tired she would 
not give up her seat to a white man as the law 
required.  Mrs. Parks went to jail and the
 Montgomery bus boycott, to be led by a 26-year old
 Baptist minister, Martin Luther King, Jr., was born.

The eventual success of the bus boycott
 encouraged a wave of massive demonstrations that
 swept across the south like a floodtime.  In 
Greensboro, North Carolina, in 1960, a group of 
students denied service at a lunch counter started 
the sit-in movement.  That same year, the student"

work, job guidance, cultural and recreational
planning - the daily grind of a community activist.
Dr. King, while he lived, once called her ""the great
fuse that led to the modern stride toward freedom.""
She made the stride while sitting still.

Mrs. Parks was for a number of years, a
receptionist-secretary to Representative John
Conyers. A religious person, she serves as deaconess
of St. Matthews A.M.E. Church in Detroit. She accepts
many speaking engagements because she wants to
help ""young people grow, develop, and reach their
potential.""

The Civil Rights Movement suffered many defeats
in the first half of the twentieth century. Repeated
efforts to obtain passage of federal anti-lynching
bills failed, as a series of presidents expressed
sympathy but would not exert sufficient pressure
on a Senate dominated by southerners. The all-white
primary, which effectively disenfranchised southern
blacks, resisted numerous court challenges. The
Depression worsened conditions on farms and in
ghettos.

On the plus side, the growing political power
of blacks in northern cities and an increasing liberal
trend in the Supreme Court portended the legal
and legislative victories of the 1950s and 1960s.

From the very beginning, the Urban League and
the NAACP believed that blacks could benefit from
stressing their American heritage and working
closely with whites. Less conspicuous was the view
that blacks must stress their black heritage and
strive for equality on their own. Early in the
century, this ""black power"" approach was maintained
by William Monroe Trotter, a cohort of Dubois in
the Niagara movement. Trotter, however, refused
to join the NAACP because, he said, blacks could not
trust whites to work for integration. Trotter also
felt that the NAACP was too moderate.

Black consciousness was heightened by the
Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s. And Marcus Garvey's
preaching of black unity instilled a sense of pride
and African heritage."

Black Women Politicians 
Challenge, Praise BMCR

Las Vegas (UMNS) -- Two of the most prominent 
black women in U.S. politics have 
challenged black United Methodists to
become better informed, politically aggressive 
advocates for the critical concerns 
of their community.
  ""You cannot be ignorant and free at the 
same time,"" declared Arkansas Director 
of Health Joycelyn Elders of Little Rock.
   Elders and Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) 
were keynote presenters to 500 lay
and clergypersons attending the 25th annual 
meeting of Black Methodists for
Church Renewal, United Methodism's
black caucus.
   Both women praised the black church 
for its historic, exemplary work in the area
of civil rights.  Both also decried a wave
of apathy among black Christians in the 
wake of contemporary crises such as inaccessible 
health care for the poor, ineffective 
education and support for children,
and laws that fail to protect the rights of
women.
   ""A man in the Arkansas legislature votes
against children's issues every time,"" said
Elders, the sister of a United Methodist
minister.  ""Yet he is continually voted in 
by the black constituency because our
community is not informed about all the
issues.""
   She cited appalling statistics:  one of
every two black children in the United
States is poor; 34 percent of high school
seniors admit they use drugs regularly; 54
percent of women with AIDS are black;
black young adults comprise 35 percent
of the U.S. prison population but only 18
percent of all U.S. college students; nearly 
seven of 10 black women are pregnant
before their 20th birthdays.
   Yet, she said, the church continues to 
""bury its head in the sand,"" trying to
""legislate morals instead of teaching
responsibility.""
   She challenged the black caucus to take
the 1992 presidential election seriously,
and to vote and advocate for several critical
issues including more equitable education
for the poor and programs to teach sexual
responsibility to black adolescent.
    ""Most states will not fund an education
reform bill, but will pay $25,000 a year
to keep a young black man in prison, "" said 
Elders.  ""We could sen a black child to 
Harvard for what it costs to keep one person 
in prison.""
   Waters, dynamic and outspoken, was
equally tough, challenging black
Christians to look beyond the sloganeering 
of vocal conservatives, and to take a
strong stand on behalf of the myriad needs
of the poor and oppressed.
   She defended the national welfare
system, currently under attack by budget-slashing
legislators as being too costly and
full of cheaters.  ""Don't you be ashamed
of the fact that some people need help.
Understand that some children would
starve if it were not for welfare,"" Waters
said.
  ""Yes, some people take advantage of the
system and are ripping us off,"" she said.
""But, as I tell my colleagues in Congress,
don't you dare talk to me about welfare
ripoffs unless you talk to me about the savings 
and loans!""
   Championing universal health care and
more government support of the poor,
Waters cited statistics about the large
number of children who are poor, and the
fact that a black woman, for instance,
makes only 49 cents for every dollar
earned by a white U.S. male.
   ""The problem is not welfare, but that
the United States has failed to provide 
equal opportunity"" so welfare would be
unnecessary, she added.
   Waters was unabashed in her criticism
of former President Ronald Reagan an incumbent 
George Bush, declaring that their 
years in office have ""heaped a kind of pain
on our people that we do not deserve.""
   She pointed to the irony of an outpouring 
of U.S. support for citizens of the
former Soviet Union-""people were
scared of just a few years ago.""
   ""I want some foreign-affairs money for
Watts, for Cabrini-Green in Chicago, for
the Bronx and Harlem,"" she said.  ""I love 
everybody, but charity begin at home.""
   Waters demanded that the church take
the lead in countering voter apathy in the 
black community.  ""We can determine who
will be the next president of the United
States,"" she said, netting thunderous
cheers.
   ""It is time for us to use our power, "" she
said.  ""We cannot continue to have election 
days in the United States where only
20 percent of our people vote.  People died
for us so we could vote and we don't exercise 
that right.
   ""Fannie Lou Hamer (a 1960s voting-rights
advocate) would turn over in her
grave,"" Waters said.

Rosa Parks Visits Tanner Chapel
by Christopher Champion

Phoenix, AZ--Historic civil rights activist,
Rosa Parks came to Phoenix on January
16-18 at the invitation of May Paul 
Johnson and the Phoenix City Council,
The Victory Now Committee and Tanner
Chapel African Methodist Episcopal
Church to aid the cause of Arizona's
energized movement for the radification of
a paid Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.
   Now 78 years young, we remember
Rosa Parks as the woman who signaled the
call that sparked the civil rights movement
when she was arrested on December 1,
1955 for refusing to give up her seat to a
white man on a Montgomery, Alabama
bus. Arriving at Phoenix's Skyharbor International
Airport on January 15, Rosa
Parks was the ""reason"" for the Mayor's
4-bus caravan of Phoenix officials, community
leaders, students and media who
enthusiastically and reverently greeted her.
   Following a press conference in which
the Mayor proclaimed Rosa Parks Day in
Phoenix and presented Mrs. Parks with the
key to the city, she took a commemorative
ride in the ""front of the bus"" flanked by
May Johnson, her assistant Elaine
Steele, Councilman Calvin Goode of Tanner
Chapel A.M.E. Church, other officials
and leaders.
   Speaking at the Annual Martin Luther
King, Jr. Breakfast sponsored by Phoenix's
Human Relations Commission on January
17, Mrs. Parks told an overflowing crowd
of over 4,000 to ""Hold fast to Martin's
dream, never give up hope, and there will
be a paid holiday honoring Dr. King in
Arizona. Fight in a way that is courageous
and diligent and have great faith in god,
whether you have religion or not.""
   In the afternoon following the breakfast
event, the Reverend Benjamin N.
Thomas, Sr., pastor of Tanner Chapel
A.M.E. Church, provided the leadership
for an autograph reception at Tanner
Chapel Church honoring Mrs. Parks
where she personally signed hundreds of 
copies of her new book titled Rosa Parks:
My Story. A multi-cultural and ethnic over
flowing crowd began gatheing at Tanner
Chapel hours before the reception was
scheduled to start--coming to buy her
book, hear a word from her mouth, touch
her garment or just to get a glimpse of
""Precious Rosa.'
   At Tanner Chapel, Mrs. Parks showed
a special sense of communion with all the
children, cautioning that they be loved,
nurtured and trained well for "". . .our
children are our future."" Rosa Parks: My
Story highly recommended.

MISSION: A Global Vision is an Urgent Need Today

Rev. Winton M. Hill

Stamford, CT -- Mission is the way the 
church lives out its self-understanding; its 
reason for being. The mission of the 
A.M.E. Church is based on a biblical 
understanding of mission revealed in God's 
involvement in history in general, the mission 
of Jesus in particular, and the experiences 
of African people in the United 
States, the Caribbean and in Africa.

The mission of Jesus is central and is 
perhaps best described in the Lukan passage: 

""The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, 
because he has anointed me to preach 
good news to the poor. He has sent me 
to proclaim release to the captives and 
recovering sight to the blind, to set at 
liberty those who are oppressed, to proclaim 
the acceptable year of the Lord.""

In this passage Jesus defines his ministry 
as related to the oppression of the poor. 
It is a ministry which deals with human 
structures that keep people in bondage. 
This understanding of ministry seeks to
deal with the whole person, i.e. the individual's 
social existence as well as the 
spiritual. This has greatly influenced 
ministry and mission in the African 
Methodist Church. The experiences of 
African people are crucial to understanding 
mission and ministry in Africa, South 
America and the Caribbean. 

Much has been written to chronicle the 
experiences of people of African descent 
in the United States and in the world. The 
story is one of European greed, exploitation 
blacks, suffering and struggling by our 
people and ultimate victory. Foundational 
to this story is the inextricable relationship 
between racism and economics. The result 
is a form of oppression based on race and 
manifested in the main by people of European 
descent economically exploiting and 
depriving people of African descent. 

Following the end of the Atlantic slave 
trade in the 19th century the nations of 
Europe divided Africans among 
themselves and through devious means 
and military might further oppressed the 
people through colonization. The natural 
resources of the land and the labor of the 
people were misused to benefit the 
metropolitan centers of the West. White 
racism is ubiquitous, influencing almost 
every aspect of our civilization to include 
economics, politics, science, law and 
religion.

The mission of the A.M.E. Church has 
developed in response to the experience 
of its people who have been and continue 
to be victims of a white racist society. 
Since our approach to mission is routed 
in the Bill, and in the mission of Jesus, 
as a result of this and a staunch faith in 
the power of our risen Lord, African 
Methodism has aggressevely and prophetically 
fought for the rights of the people 
it served.

As we struggle to do mission 
in these times of tight budget, there 
well may be short-sighted voices urging us 
to abandon the work of overseas mission. 
Our very ""reason for being"" would prohibit 
such an option.

We are God's tool for such a time as 
this. We provide a good model of African 
descendants lifting and being lifted by 
others of African descent. African 

Methodism is unique among the churches 
in Africa. We have not fought a Eurocentric 
Christianity as individuals in South 
Africa where every church has affixed 
""God our Father, Christ our Redeemer, 
Man our Brother"" on the front wall. 
Our South African brothers and sisters 
have learned from our bishops, ministers 
and missionaries, that God is their personal 
father, God is a good father, a father 
who is aware of the plight of His children 
and is delivering them from the valley of 
the darkness of oppression into the 
marvelous light of full liberation and 
reconciliation.

Our sisters and brothers in South 
America, the Caribbean and in Africa are 
familiar with the traditions of Bishop 
Richard Allen and how he led a small 
band of African people from St. George 
and formed the free African society and 
eventually to Mother Bethel, thus 
demonstrating our own self-determination. 

Many churches in Africa have concerned 
themselves with the issues of 
Eurocentric theology and their legitimate 
need to discard it. However, African 
churches with African leadership (whether 
the African was born on the continent of 
Africa or in the United States) have been 
more focused rationalizing their theology 
of liberation. The African Methodist 
Episcopal Church has always been able to 
articulate how God became incarnate in 
Jesus Christ in order to liberate oppressed 
communities. The African Methodist 
members in South America, the Caribbean 
and in Africa share a common story 
of exploitation and oppression. Their story 
is our story and we are pieces of an identical 
fabric, a fabric that is without seam 
or separation. African American people 
live a third world lifestyle in the richest 
nation in the world. We are brothers and 
sisters in a common suffering and in a 
common liberation and reconciliation. 

God did give His Son to save the world. 
We in the African Methodist Episcopal 
Church are called upon by God to give 
ourselves in mission. We don't have a lot 
of money and we don't have large budgets, 
but we do have a Lord who taught His 
church the value of 2 fish and 2 loaves. 
If we will commit our little bit of resources 
to the hands of Jesus, it will be sufficient. 
We are the children of our parents. They 
built churches and supported colleges on 
their ""egg money.""

In Africa today there are three glaring 
circumstances that require an immediate 
response: food, education and medical 
care. God has given us the ability to do 
ministry among the ""have nots."" We have 
200 years of victorious stewardship and 
can lead others to progress while they 
""make do."" We have learned in our history 
that often when we least expected it help
did come (often from unanticipated 
places). Our experiences in the Atlantic 
passage chained in the belly of the slave 
ships has taught us that if we can simply 
hold on, we can ultimately hold out. We 
have begun a great work, we have a farm 
in Zambia and people are being fed. Let's 
build on it. We have a college and 
seminary in South Africa and students are 
being educated in a theology of liberation. 
Let's build on it. We have day care centers 
in Africa that could serve in dual 
capacities as family clinics and nutrition 
sights. In Haiti we have a medical clinic. 
Let's build on it. 

As we participate in another general 
conference, we must reaffirm our commitment 
to missions. We have come to realize 
that the genious of African Methodism is 
that we have dealt aggressively with the 
social, political and economic issues that 
effect our members while at the same time 
nurturing them spiritually. As we move 
forward into the final years of this century, 
we must remember that we are not alone 

in our attempts to make the mission real. 
Ultimate victory is assured because of the 
presence of the Holy Spirit. As the spirit 
of the Lord was upon Jesus when He proclaimed 
liberty to the captives, just as the 
spirit of the Lord was upon Jesus when 
He preached good news to the poor, just 
as the spirit of the Lord was with Jesus 
when He healed the sick, just as the spirit 
of God was with Jesus during His death 
and eventual resurrection, so shall this 
spirit be with us.

This means that we have a continued 
source of refreshment and empowerment 
as we protest against injustices 
everywhere. No gospel written ties mission 
and spirit together any more clearly 
than John:

""Jesus said to them again, 'Peace be 
with you. As the father has sent me even 
as I send you.' And when he said this he 
breathed on them and said to them. 
Receive the Holy Spirit.'""

God gave us the essential ingredient for 
victory--Spiritual Power. Alone we can do 
little. But with the Holy Spirit we can successfully 
confront any missional challenge 
which lies ahead. Let us claim this power 
and go forward to chart new courses for 
mission in African Methodism.

WASHINGTON

In the nation's capital where
Rosa Parks was recently 
honored, hard hat workers, 
engineers, fast-food servers all
recognized her name. Even children in
the third grade lit up, and chimed
""That's the lady who said 'It's no
fair.'""
Several months ago, in 
Washington's National Portrait Gallery, 
in a room covered with namesake
pink roses, Mrs. Parks listened
modestly as politicians, civil rights
leaders - including Coretta Scott
King - and Washington elite of 

DUSKETT ROACH 

ROSA PARKS: She spoke of the spirit
and inspiration driving her efforts. 

every ideological persuasion, 
sang her praises. She spoke 
eloquently as her portrait in bronze
was dedicated in the gallery to sit
alongside other significant Americans.
That honor was not nearly as 
impressive as the person herself.
Over the years, the understated
yet immensely dynamic Rosa
Parks has been mythologized and
become a part of the nation's folk-
lore. Her act of defiance when
asked to give up her seat to a
white person on a segregated bus
gave birth to the nation's first
organized resistance to segregation.
It is fitting that the artist commissioned
to sculpt the bronze
likeness of Parks - Los Angeles-
based sculptor Artis Lane - will be
the first black woman artist to
have work included in the National
Gallery.
""I was a young black female
artist in the '50s when Rosa Parks
became a civil rights symbol overnight.
I was a woman, and a minority,
trying to make it as a fine
artist, and it was discouraging....
We were were supposed to be domestics
back then, not sculptors,""
recalls Ms. Lane. Lane's career
has included making portraits of
Henry Kissinger, Barbara Bush,
Cary Grant, Sidney Poitier, and
others. But Lane speaks of Parks
with special admiration.
""What immediately struck me 
about Mrs. Parks was that never
did a negative or hateful word
come from her mouth, ""Lane
says.

NATIONAL PORTRAIT GALLERY: Artis Lane's sculpture of Parks was installed as a tribute to Parks's civil rights struggle.

The sculptor has succeeded in
capturing the indomitable spirit
of Parks in the portrait. She is depicted
as she looks today, Lane
says, because Parks's influence
and her mark on history is timeless.
""During the student demonstrations
in China and when the
Berlin Wall came down, those
people sang 'We Shall Overcome;'
it seems to me that Rosa's
influence will exist wherever people
are fighting for equal rights.
In person, Parks has a certain 
animated light that
comes through her eyes,
very much as she did when her
face was splashed across periodicals
as the seamstress that defied
Southern law.
When asked if the portrait reminded
her of the events of that 
day she spent in the Alabama jail,
Parks gets a certain twinkle in her
eye and responds, not missing a
beat: ""I remember a bit more
clearly the day many, many rough
months later when National
Guardsmen stood by as blacks
were allowed to board desegregated
buses.
""I remember the face of the 
bus driver watching us get on his
bus and sit where we pleased....
He was also the same bus driver
that had me arrested when I finally
said I would not get up.... I 
guess we are both symbols of 
change.""
In creating the likeness of 
Parks, Lane says she took a few
artistic liberties: ""Mrs. Parks
wears her long silver hair pushed
back, and when she came to my
studio I asked her to braid it and
pile it on her head like a tiara. I
worked the hair in a very sketchy
indefinite fashion so that it barely
suggests a crown or an aura, my
symbol for a regalness that Parks
radiates... I made the bust
slightly larger than life size, so
that the viewer is pulled right into
those eyes, that brow and jaw, all
of which convey the most uncanny
combination of tenderness
and conviction.""
The other quality that comes
through in this portrait is a focus
that has motivated Parks's three
decades of civil rights advocacy.
""I wanted an intense, intelligent
gaze that would counteract
all the stereotypes and cliches that
describe Mrs. Parks's behavior on
that bus as an accidental gesture
by a tired black worker or a defiant
gesture by someone stirring
up trouble. It was something
spontaneous, but it was also intelligent
and considered, and I
wanted all those qualities to come
through,"" says Lane."

A Grand Gallery Design Holds Its Own in Washington
By Louise Sweeney
Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor
Washington

It took 800 boxcars of rose-white
marble from Tennessee to build the
National Gallery of Art on the site of
a former mattress factory and wood lot.
The Gallery, a 785 ft. by 303 ft. gift to
the nation, was art collector and former
Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon's
""stately pleasure dome"" decreed for art,
to borrow a line from Coleridge. Mellon
also chose the designer, the talented classical
architect John Russell Pope, who had
studied at both the American Academy in
Rome and the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in
Paris. Mellon chose Pope at the peak of
Pope's career; he had already put his seal
on the National Archives Building (the
most important building in the Federal
Triangle), as well as the Jefferson Memorial,
the Medieval Hall of
Metropolitan Museum in New York, and
the Tate Gallery and British Museum in
London.
An architectural exhibition titled
""John Russell Pope and the Building of
the National Gallery of Art,"" will run
through July 7 in Pope's West Building in
conjunction with the ""Art for the Nation""
50th Anniversary show in the I. M. Pei-designed
East Building.
National Gallery director J. Carter
Brown traces the difficulties Pope encountered
in realizing his design for a
single block stretching from 4th to 7th
streets. Sketches by Pope in the show illustrate,
says Mr. Brown, ""his definitive
scheme for the gallery, with the domed
rotunda at the center, a pair of long sculpture
halls on either side.... The Commission
of Fine Arts ... was not comfortable
with the idea of adding another domed 
building to the mall. And the commissioners
asked Pope to restudy his design,
omitting the dome, which Pope was very
reluctant to do...."" As visitors to the 
gallery know, the architect triumphed.
Andrew Mellon offered both his collection
of 132 works of art (including
works by Rembrandt, Titian, Raphael,
Botticelli, and Van Dyck) and money for
the building of a National Gallery to President
Franklin Roosevelt at the peak of
the Depression in 1936. In 1937 Congress
approved its construction and
maintenance. Two months later, within a 
day of each other, Mellon and Pope died.
But the basic plan for the building was 
complete and the work went on. The
gallery was dedicated on March 17, 1941.
When it opened, says gallery director
Brown, ""Andrew Mellon's original gift of
of paintings to the National Gallery was
enough to fill about 5 of the 135 galleries.""
Soon, what Brown calls ""the 
founding benefactors,"" began to fill the
galleries with art - great art, as Mellon
had stipulated. Brown notes that when
the Mellon gift was accepted, ""The understanding
was that the private sector
would provide the art. And it always has.
We have not ever spent a penny of federal
funds on our collections.""
Since the gallery opened, architectural
views have come full circle. A film on
Pope shown in conjunction with the West 
Building exhibition notes that at the time 
the building went up, ""rose-white marble
and neoclassical grandeur were rapidly
becoming fair game for derision."" It was
called by one critic ""a Mausoleum for
dead masters,"" and by another, ""The Last
of the Romans."" The years have vindicated
those who viewed it as ""pristine,
classical, serene."" Elements of classical architecture
appear in buildings just built 
or planned for the Pennsylvania Avenue
corridor.
Brown says ""very few would have predicted
that people would be looking with
new eyes at John Russell Pope today....
The new Market Square [complex] across
from Pope's Archives building and not far
from the National Gallery is in a style I
think Pope would approve of.... It does
something I thought I would never see
again in my lifetime in Washington: classical
columns, fluted, with capitals, and
bases, and plinths.... We are in the middle
of a revolution."""

Rosa Parks, ""mother"" of the Civil Rights Movement, is embraced by Coretta
Scott King at the unveiling of her sculpture.  Sculptress Artis Lane looks on
at the Smithsonian, where Rep. John Conyers lauds Mrs. Parks.

Sculpture of Civil Rights
Heroine Rosa Parks Unveiled

   Personifying the quite dignity 
for which she has always been 
known and admired, Rosa Parks,
the ""mother"" of the Civil Rights
Movement, appeared humbled as 
hundreds watched the unveiling
of a bronze bust of her image at
the Smithsonian Institution in the
nation's capital.
   ""This is the high point of my
life,"" said the 78-year-old Mrs.
Parks, who 35 years ago kindled
the flames of equality by refusing
to relinquish her seat on a Montgomery,
Ala., bus.
   The recent unveiling of the bust
of Mrs. Parks, which will be permanently
displayed at the Smithsonian's
National Portrait Gallery,
attracted numerous civil rights
leaders who have been at the forefront
of the movement.  Among 
those who came to honor Mrs.
Parks were Coretta Scott King,
Southern Christian Leadership
Conference Executive Director
Rev. Joseph Lowery, National
Council of Negro Women President
Dr. Dorothy Height, Democratic
National Committee Black
Caucus Chair C. Delores Tucker,
former President of the New York
state NAACP Hazel N. Dukes,
Congressman John Conyers and
John Lewis, actress Cicely Tyson
and D. C. Mayor Sharon Pratt Dixon,
who presented Mrs. Parks 
with a key to the city during the
ceremony.
    In accepting the sculpture, gallery
Director Alan Fern said, ""Rosa
Parks' act of courage on a December
day in 1955 sparked a revolution
of conscience.  We honor her today
as an American hero, a woman 
willing to put herself in jeopardy for
others.  The National Portrait Gallery
records and celebrates individuals
whose actions, words and 
thoughts have shaped us as a nation.
Among them, unquestionably,
is Rosa Parks.  Her portrait will remind
generations to come that one
courageous deed can change the

Sculpture of catalyst
in 1960s civil rights
movement unveiled

National Portrait Gallery as Cicely Tyson (right) looks on.

Washington-In 1955, Rosa
Parks made history by refusing
to stand while riding in a Montgomery,
Ala., bus with empty
""white-only"" seats. The anti-segregation
bus boycott that followed and
the Little Rock, Ark., school desegregation
crisis helped spark Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr.'s Southern Christian Leadership
Conference and the civil rights
crusades of the 1960s.
Now 78, Parks last week was officially
enshrined as a part of American history
with the unveiling of a bronze bust of
her at Washington's National Portrait 
Gallery.
Among the notables present for the
gallery ceremonies honoring her as
Mother of the Civil Rights Movement
were Coretta Scott King, Dr. King's
widow; District of Columbia Mayor
Sharon Pratt Dixon; Carmen Turner,
undersecretary of the Smithsonian Institution;
and actress Cicely Tyson, who
read the poem ""Still I Rise"" by black
poet Maya Angelou, which includes the
lines:
""Out of the huts of history's shame
I rise
Up from a past that's rooted in pain
I rise
I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,
Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.
Leaving behind nights of terror and
fear
I rise
Into a daybreak that's wondrously
clear
I rise
Bringing the gifts that my ancestors
gave
I am the dream and the hope of the
slave.
I rise
I rise
I rise.""
The gallery's Great Hall, where the
bust will be on exhibit through May 1,
was decorated with 100 pink roses (as
derived [from?] [?] [?] name Rosa
means pink as well as the flower rose).
The bust is by sculptor Artis Lane,
whose work has been collected by
George and Barbara Bush, musician
Quincy Jones, actor Sidney Poitier,
comedian Bill Cosby and talk-show host
Oprah Winfrey.

Even the commander in chief has a
commander in chief, it seems. The president
got his marching orders last week
from Mrs. Bush while she was visiting
with military families at Maryland's Ft.
Meade. Now that the Persian Gulf war
has concluded, her orders (perhaps we
should call them ""unmarching orders"")
were: Knock it off now and take some
rest and relaxation.
Mrs. Bush, stepping to news microphones,
put it a little more gracefully,
saying: ""I hope he'll get a little sun, a
little fishing and get a little rest. He's
been doing his job 24 hours a day, seven
days a week. I hope he's listening.""
Speaking directly to the president, she
then said: ""Your pass is signed!""
When not dealing with military communiques
and orders, Bush has been so
transfixed by TV screens in the last few
weeks that holding a news conference
would probably be the only way Mrs.
Bush had to tell him it was time for
dinner.
The Bushes are spending the weekend
at nearby Camp David, Md., where the
rainy weather isn't expected to give him
much of a tan. Plans for a longer and
sunnier respite are in the works.

Congressional Quarterly has come out
with something that many in the capital
wish had been published decades ago: a
thoroughgoing, comprehensive congressional
directory that weighs less than 20
pounds and doesn't require and wheelbarrow
to transport--indeed, one that can
actually fit in a pocket. (It is 2 inches
thick, however, suitable more for the
kind of deep, wide legislative pockets
that lobbyists used to keep filled back in
Congress' more notorious days.)
The directory contains fascinating information.
It notes, for example, that
Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) voted with
Bush's position 68 percent of the time
last year, and that the president carried
Hyde's northwest suburban district by
exactly 69 percent in 1988. As one
should expect from Congressional Quarterly,
the directory was current enough
to include the fact that Bush has just
nominated Rep. Ed Madigan (R-Ill.) as
the next secretary of agriculture."

All those long nights of bombing over Baghdad
had CNN ace correspondent Peter Arnett
thinking of more pleasant things:  his girlfriend,
Kimberly Moore, in Jerusalem, for instance.
The 56-year-old Arnett called Moore, who is
in her early twenties, and proposed marriage,
the Washingtonian is reporting in its March
issue.  The couple met when Moore was an
undergraduate student working as an intern in
CNN's Washington bureau.
After graduating from Florida State University
last spring, Moore moved to Jerusalem
to live with Arnett.  According to the Washingtonian,
she didn't know that Arnett hadn't yet
divorced his first wife, from whom he has been
long separated;  they have two children.  Arnett
reportedly has promised Moore that when he
gets out of Iraq, he'll get the divorce and the
couple will marry in either Washington or
France.

Out and About
Rosa Parks, the Montgomery, Ala., woman
who refused to go to the back of the bus and
kicked off the bus boycott that brought fame to
a young minister, Martin Luther King Jr., will
become part of the nation's heritage by way of
a portrait bust in the National Portrait Gallery.
Parks will be here Thursday to attend the
unveiling of the bust by Artis Lane in recognition
of her role as a civil rights leader.  The
luncheon in the gallery's Great Hall will include
a dramatic reading by actress Cicely
Tyson and remarks from D. C. Mayor Sharon
Pratt Dixon; Rep. William Clay; Dorothy
Height, National Council of Negro Women
president;  Benjamin Hooks, NAACP president;
Joseph Lowery, Southern Christian
Leadership Conference president; and Carmen
Turner, undersecretary of the Smithsonian...

There is only one conclusion to draw that
explains why CNN anchor Bernie Shaw, his
lawyer-agent Robert Barnett and Simon and

Schuster senior editor Alice Mayhew were
lunching together last week at Twenty-One
Federal; A source close to Shaw said several
publishers have approached Shaw with ideas
for a book that would be part autobiographical
and would cover some of the issues related to
CNN's worldwide reach...

Maestro Isaac Stern isn't one to let a little
thing like a Scud attack bother him.  He was in
Jerusalem on Saturday when the air raid sirens
sounded.  Several concertgoers, including Defense
Minister Moshe Arens, reached beneath
their seats for their omnipresent gas masks,
and the Israeli Philharmonic Orchestra left the
stage.  The 70-year-old Stern returned wit his
violin but without his mask.  He signaled the
audience to stay put and then played a Mozart
solo for the packed, silent concert hall.  It was

10 minutes before the all-clear sounded and
the audience could remove their masks...

The Washington Performing Arts Society
celebrated its 25th anniversary at the Kennedy
Center Concert Hall Saturday night with
guest artists Vladimir Ashkenazy, Lynn Harrell
and Itzhak Perlman performing.  At the
dinner that followed in the center's Israeli
Lounge, hosted by Kennedy Center Chairman
Jim Wolfensohn, there were special acknowledgements
of Patrick Hayes, founder of WPAS;
Doug Wheeler, WPAS managing director; Alexine
Jackson, president of the WPAS board;
and Mary Belin, who has been designated the
WPAS founding director.  Belin also gave the
center the River Terrace fountains in memory
of her husband, Peter Belin.  Other guests
included Rep. Sid Yates, Sen. Carl Levin and
Rep. Ben Erdreich...

LIFT EV'RY VOICE AND SING

Lift ev'ry voice and sing,
Till earth and heaven ring,
Ring with the harmonies of liberty;
Let our rejoicing rise high as the list'ning skies,
Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.
Sing a song full of the hope that the present has taught us;
Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us;
Facing the rising sun of our new day begun,
Let us march on till victory is won.

Stony the road we trod,
Bitter the chast'ning rod,
Fell in the days when hope unborn had died;
Yet with a steady beat,
Have not our weary feet
Come to the place for which our fathers sighed?
We have come over a way that with tears has been watered;
We have come, treading our path thru' the blood of the slaughtered,
Out from the gloomy past, till now we stand at last
Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast.

students, the young ministers of the gospel and a host of their
elders, courageously and nonviolently sitting in at lunch counters
and willingly going to jail for conscience' sake.  One day the South
will know that when these disinherited children of God sat down at
lunch counters, they were in reality standing up for what is best in the
American dream and for the most sacred values in our Judaeo-Christian 
heritage, thereby bringing our nation back to those great
wells of democracy which were dug deep by the founding fathers in
their formulation of the Constitution and the Declaration of
Independence.14 

Never before have I written so long a letter.  I'm afraid it is
much too long to take your precious time.  I can assure you that it
would have been much shorter if I had been writing from a
comfortable desk, but what else can one do when he is alone in a 
narrow jail cell, other than write long letters, think long thoughts
and pray long prayers?

If I have said anything in this letter that overstates the truth
and indicates an unreasonable impatience, I beg you to forgive me.  If
I have said anything that understates the truth and indicated my
having a patience that allows me to settle for anything less than
brotherhood, I beg God to forgive me. 

I hope this letter finds you strong in the faith.  I also hope that

means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek.  I have tried to
make clear that it is wrong to use immoral means to attain moral 
ends.  But now I must affirm that it is just as wrong, or perhaps 
even more so, to use moral means to preserve immoral 
ends.  Perhaps Mr. Connor and his policemen have been rather
nonviolent in public, as was Chief Pritchett in Albany, Georgia, but
they have used the moral means of nonviolence to maintain
the immoral end of racial injustice.  As T.S..Eliot has said: 
""The last temptation is the greatest treason:  To do the
right deed for the  wrong reason.""13 

I wish you had commended the Negro sit-inners and
demonstrators of Birmingham for their sublime courage, their
willingness to suffer and their amazing discipline, in the midst of
great provocation.  One day the South will recognize its real heroes.
They will be the James Merediths, with the noble sense of purpose 
that enables them to face jeering and hostile mobs, and with the
agonizing loneliness that characterizes the life of the pioneer.  They
will be old, oppressed, battered Negro woman, symbolized in a 
seventy-two-year-old woman in Montgomery, Alabama, who rose up
with a sense of dignity and with her people decided not to ride
segregated buses, and who responded with ungrammatical profundity
to one who inquired about her weariness:  ""My feets is tired, but my
soul is at rest.""  They will be the young high school and college 

"

they continued to thrive and develop.  If the inexpressible cruelties
of slavery could not stop us, the opposition we now face will surely
fail.  We will win our freedom because the sacred heritage of our
nation and the eternal will of God are embodied in our echoing
demands.12 

Before closing I feel impelled to mention one other point in
your statement that has troubled me profoundly.  You warmly
commended the Birmingham police force for keeping ""order"" and 
""preventing violence.""  I doubt that you would have so warmly
commended the police force if you had seen its dogs sinking their
teeth into unarmed, nonviolent Negroes.  I doubt that you would so
quickly commend the policemen if you were to observe their ugly and
inhumane treatment of Negroes here in the city jail;  if you were to
watch them push and curse old Negro women and young Negro girls; 
if you were to see them slap and kick old Negro men and young boys; 
if you were to observe them, as they did on two occasions, refuse to
give us food because we wanted to sing our grace together.  I cannot
join you in your praise of the Birmingham police department. 

It is true that the police have exercised a degree of discipline
in handling the demonstrators.  In this sense they have conducted 
themselves rather ""nonviolently"" in public.  But for what purpose?
To preserve the evil system of segregation.  Over the past few years 
I have consistently preached that nonviolence demands that the

Rosa Parks: In Her Own Words,Icon in the Making,"Rosa Parks Papers: Events, 1951-2005; Featuring or honoring Parks; 1990",mss859430248,mss859430248-53,completed,http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:mss:mss85943:0019:15:0053/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg,"25 

secure congregations and walked the streets of Albany, Georgia with
us.  They have gone  down the highways of the South on tortuous 
rides for freedom.  Yes, they have gone to jail with us.  Some have
been dismissed from their churches, have lost the support of their
bishops and fellow ministers.  But they have acted in the faith that
right defeated is stronger than evil triumphant.  Their witness has
been the spiritual salt that has preserved the true meaning of the
gospel in these troubled times.  They have carved a tunnel of hope
through the dark mountain of disappointment. 

I hope the church as a whole will meet the challenge of this
decisive hour.  But even if the church does not come to the aid of
justice, I have no despair about the future.  I have  no fear about the
outcome of our struggle in Birmingham, even if our motives are at
present misunderstood.  We will reach the goal of freedom in 
Birmingham and all over the nation, because the goal of America 
is freedom.  Abused and scorned though we may be, our destiny is
tied up with America's destiny.  Before the pilgrims landed at
Plymouth, we were here.  Before the pen of Jefferson etched the
majestic words of the Declaration of Independence across the pages 
of history, we were here.  For more than two centuries our
forebears labored in this country without wages;  they made cotton
king;  they built the homes of their masters while suffering gross
injustice and shameful humiliation, yet out of a bottomless vitality 

"
Rosa Parks: In Her Own Words,Icon in the Making,"Rosa Parks Papers: Events, 1951-2005; Featuring or honoring Parks; 1990",mss859430248,mss859430248-52,completed,http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:mss:mss85943:0019:15:0052/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg,"24 

example they brought an end to such ancient evils as infanticide and
gladiatorial contests. 

Things are different now.  So often the contemporary church is
a weak, ineffectual voice with an uncertain sound.  So often it is an
archdefender of the status quo.  Far from being disturbed by the
presence of the church, the power structure of the average
community is consoled by the church's silent--and often even vocal
--sanction of things as they are. 

But the judgement of God is upon the church as never before.  If
today's church does not recapture the sacrificial spirit of the early
church, it will lose its authenticity, forfeit the loyalty of millions,
and be dismissed as an irrelevant social club with no meaning for
the twentieth century.  Every day I meet young people whose 
disappointment with the church has turned into outright disgust. 

Perhaps I have once again been too optimistic.  Is organized 
religion too inextricably bound to the status quo to save
our nation and the world?11  Perhaps I must turn my faith to the
inner spiritual church, the church within the church, as the true
ekklesia and the hope of the world.  But again I am thankful to God
that some noble souls from the ranks of organized religion have
broken loose from the paralyzing chains of conformity and joined us
as active partners in the struggle for freedom.  They have left their

creative protest?"" 

Yes, these questions are still in my mind.  In deep
disappointment I have wept over the laxity of the church.  But be
assured that my tears have been tears of love.  There can be no deep
disappointment where there is not deep love.  Yes, I love the church
How could I do otherwise?  I am in the rather unique position of
being the son, the grandson and the great-grandson of preachers. 
Yes, I see the church as the body of Christ.  But, oh!  How we have
blemished and scarred that body through social neglect and
through fear of being nonconformists.10 

There was a time when the church was very powerful---in the
time when the early Christians rejoiced at being deemed worthy to
suffer for what they believed.  In those days the church was not
merely a thermometer that recorded the ideas and principles of
popular opinion;  it was a thermostat that transformed the mores of
society.  Whenever the early Christians entered a town, the people in 
power became disturbed and immediately sought to convict the
Christians for being ""disturbers of the peace"" and ""outside
agitators.""  But the Christians pressed on, in the conviction that they
were ""a colony of heaven,""  called to obey God rather than man. 
Small in number, they were big in commitment.  They were too God-intoxicated
to be ""astronomically intimidated.""  By their effort and

integration is morally right and because the Negro is your
brother.""  In the midst of blatant injustices inflicted upon 
the Negro, I have watched white churchmen stand on the
sideline and mouth pious irrelevancies and sanctimonious
trivialities.  In the midst of a mighty struggle to rid our
nation of racial and economic injustice, I have heard many
ministers say:  ""Those are social issues, with which the
gospel has no real concern.""  And I have watched many
churches commit themselves to a completely otherworldly 
religion which makes a strange, un-Biblical distinction
between body and soul, between the sacred and the
secular.9 

I have traveled the length and breadth of Alabama, Mississippi
and all the other southern states.  On sweltering summer days and 
crisp autumn mornings I have looked at the South's beautiful churches
with their lofty spires pointing heavenward.  I have beheld the
impressive outlines of her massive religious-education buildings.
Over and over I have found myself asking:  ""What kind of people
worship here?  Who is their God?  Where were their voices when the
lips of Governor Barnett dripped with words of interposition and
nullification?  Where were they when Governor Wallace gave a
clarion call for defiance and hatred?  Where were their voices of
support when bruised and weary Negro men and women decided to
rise from the dark dungeons of complacency to the bright hills of 

"
Rosa Parks: In Her Own Words,Icon in the Making,"Rosa Parks Papers: Events, 1951-2005; Featuring or honoring Parks; 1990",mss859430248,mss859430248-49,completed,http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:mss:mss85943:0019:15:0049/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg,"21 

by its spiritual blessings and who will remain true to it as long as
the cord of life shall lengthen. 

When I was suddenly catapulted into the leadership of the bus
protest in Montgomery, Alabama, a few years ago, I felt we would be
supported by the white church.  I felt that the white ministers,
priests and rabbis of the South would be among our strongest allies.
Instead, some have been outright opponents, refusing to understand
the freedom movement and misrepresenting its leaders;  all too
many others have been more cautious than courageous and have
remained silent behind the anesthetizing security of stained-glass
windows. 

In spite of my shattered dreams, I came to Birmingham with
the hope that the white religious leadership of this community
would see the justice of our cause and, with deep moral concern, 
would serve as the channel through which our just grievances could
reach the power structure.  I had hoped that each of you would
understand.  But again I have been disappointed. 

I have heard numerous southern religious leaders
admonish their worshipers to comply with a desegregation
decision because it is the law, but I have longed to hear 
white ministers declare:  ""Follow this decree because"
Rosa Parks: In Her Own Words,Icon in the Making,"Rosa Parks Papers: Events, 1951-2005; Featuring or honoring Parks; 1990",mss859430248,mss859430248-48,completed,http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:mss:mss85943:0019:15:0048/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg,"20 

Golden, James McBride Dabbs, Ann Braden and Sarah Patton Boyle--
have written about our struggle in eloquent and prophetic terms. 
Others have marched with us down nameless streets of the South. 
They have languished in filthy, roach-infested jails, suffering the
abuse and brutality of policemen who view them as ""dirty nigger-lovers."" 
Unlike so many of their moderate brothers and sisters,
they have recognized the urgency of the moment and sensed the need
for powerful ""action"" antidotes to combat the disease of
segregation. 

Let me take note of my other major disappointment.  I have
been so greatly disappointed with the white church and its
leadership.  Of course, there are some notable exceptions.  I am not
unmindful of the fact that each of you has taken some significant
stands on this issue.  I commend you, Reverend Stallings, for your
Christian stand on this past Sunday, in welcoming Negroes to your
worship service on a nonsegregated basis.  I commend the Catholic
leaders of this state for integrating Spring Hill College Several 
years ago. 

But despite these notable exceptions, I must honestly reiterate
that I have been disappointed with the church.  I do not say this as
one of those negative critics who can always find something wrong
with the church.  I say this as a minister of the gospel, who loves
the church; who was nurtured in its bosom;  who has been sustained"
Rosa Parks: In Her Own Words,Icon in the Making,"Rosa Parks Papers: Events, 1951-2005; Featuring or honoring Parks; 1990",mss859430248,mss859430248-47,completed,http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:mss:mss85943:0019:15:0047/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg,"19 

before I make a butchery of my conscience.'  And Abraham Lincoln: 
""This nation cannot survive half slave and half free.""  And Thomas
Jefferson:  ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are
created equal...""  So the question is not whether we will be 
extremists, but what kind of extremist we will be.  Will we be
extremists for hate or for love?  Will we be extremists for the
preservation of injustice or for the extension of justice?  In that
dramatic scene on Calvary's hill three men were crucified.  We must
never forget that all three were crucified for the same crime--the
crime of extremism.  Two were extremists for immorality, and thus
fell below their environment.  The other, Jesus Christ, was an
extremist for love, truth and goodness, and thereby rose above his
environment.  Perhaps the South, the nation and the world are in dire
need of creative extremists. 

I had hoped that the white moderate would see this need.
Perhaps I was too optimistic;  perhaps I expected too much.  I
suppose I should have realized that few members of the oppressor 
race can understand the deep groans and passionate yearnings of the
oppressed race, and still fewer have the vision to see that injustice
must be rooted out by strong, persistent and determined action.  I 
am thankful, however, that some of our white brothers in the South
have grasped the meaning of this social revolution and committed
themselves to it.  They are still all too few in quantity, but they are
big in quality.  Some--such as Ralph McGill, Lillian Smith, Harry 

"
Rosa Parks: In Her Own Words,Icon in the Making,"Rosa Parks Papers: Events, 1951-2005; Featuring or honoring Parks; 1990",mss859430248,mss859430248-46,completed,http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:mss:mss85943:0019:15:0046/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg,"18 

recognizes this vital urge that has engulfed the Negro community,
one should readily understand why public demonstrations are taking
place.  The Negro has many pent-up resentments and latent
frustrations, and he must release them.  So let him march;  let him
make prayer pilgrimages to the city hall;  let him go on freedom
rides and try to understand why he must do so.  If his repressed 
emotions are not released in nonviolent ways, they will seek
expression through violence;  this is not a threat but a fact of
history.  So I have not said to my people:  ""Get rid of your
discontent.""  Rather, I have tried to say that this normal and healthy
discontent can be channeled into the creative outlet of nonviolent
direct action.  And now this approach is being termed extremist. 

But although I was initially disappointed at being categorized as
an extremist, as I continued to think about the matter I gradually
gained a measure of satisfaction from the label.  Was not Jesus an
extremist for love:  ""Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, 
do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully 
use you , and persecute you.""  Was not Amos an extremist for justice:
""Let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like an everflowing
stream.""  Was not Paul an extremist for the Christian gospel: 
""I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.""  Was not Martin
Luther an extremist:  ""Here I stand; I cannot do otherwise, so help me
God.""  And John Bunyan:  ""I will stay in jail to the end of my days 

"
Rosa Parks: In Her Own Words,Icon in the Making,"Rosa Parks Papers: Events, 1951-2005; Featuring or honoring Parks; 1990",mss859430248,mss859430248-45,completed,http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:mss:mss85943:0019:15:0045/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg,"17 

I have tried to stand between these two forces, saying that we need emulate
neither the ""do-nothingism"" of the complacent nor the hatred and despair of the
black nationalist.  For there is the more excellent way of love and nonviolent
protest.  I am grateful to God that, through the influence of the negro church, the
way of nonviolence became an integral part of our struggle. 

If this philosophy had no emerged, by now many streets of the South would, 
I am convinced, be flowing with blood.  And I am further convinced that if our white
brothers dismiss as ""rabble-rousers"" and ""outside agitators"" those of us who
employ nonviolent direct action, and if they refuse to support our nonviolent efforts, 
millions of Negroes will, out of frustration and despair, seek solace and security in
black-nationalist ideologies---a development that would inevitably lead to a 
frightening racial nightmare. 

Oppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever.  The 
yearning for freedom eventually manifests itself, and that is what 
has happened to the American Negro.  Something within has reminded 
him of his birthright of freedom, and something without has
reminded him that it can be gained.  Consciously or unconsciously, he
has been caught up by the Zeitgeist and with his black brothers of
Africa and his brown and yellow brothers of Asia, South America and
the Caribbean, the United States Negro is moving with a sense of
great urgency toward the promised land of racial justice.  If one

time creatively, in the knowledge that the time is always ripe to do
right.  Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy and
transform our pending national elegy into a creative psalm of
brotherhood.  Now is the time to lift our national policy from the
quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of human dignity. 

You speak of our activity in Birmingham as extreme.  At first I
was rather disappointed that fellow clergymen would would see my
nonviolent efforts as those of an extremist.  I began thinking about
the fact that I stand in the middle of two opposing forces in the
Negro community.  One is a force of complacency, made up in part  of 
Negroes who, as a result of long years of oppression, are so drained 
of self-respect and a sense of ""somebodiness"" that they have
adjusted to segregation; and in part of a few middle-class Negroes
who, because of a degree of academic and economic security and
because in some ways they profit by segregation, have become
insensitive to the problems of the masses.  The other force is one of
bitterness and hatred, and it comes perilously close to advocating 
violence.  It is expressed in the various black nationalist groups that 
are springing up across the nation,  the largest and best-known being 
Elliah Muhammad's Muslim movement.  Nourished by the Negro's 
frustration over the continued existence of racial discrimination,
this movement is made up of people who have lost faith in America,
who have absolutely repudiated Christianity, and who have concluded

as the federal courts have consistently affirmed, it is wrong to urge
an individual to cease his efforts to gain his basic constitutional
rights because the quest may precipitate violence.  Society must
protect the robbed and punish the robber. 

I had also hoped that the white moderate would reject the
myth concerning time in relation to the struggle for freedom.  I have 
just received a letter from a white brother in Texas.  He writes:
""All Christians know that the colored people will receive equal 
rights eventually, but it is possible that you are in too great a 
religious hurry.  It has taken Christianity almost two thousand years 
to accomplish what it has.  The teachings of Christ take time to
come to earth.""  Such an attitude stems from a tragic misconception
of time, from the strangely irrational notion that there is something
in the very flow of time that will inevitably cure all ills.  Actually,
time itself is neutral;  it can be used either destructively or 
constructively.  More and more I feel that the people of ill will have
used time much more effectively than have the people of good will. 
We will have to repent in this generation not merely for the hateful 
words and actions of the bad people but for the appalling silence of
the good people.  Human progress never rolls in on wheels of
inevitability;  it comes through the tireless efforts of men willing
to be co-workers with God, and without this hard work time itself
becomes an ally of the forces of social stagnation.  We must use

dams that block the flow of social progress.  I had hoped that the
white moderate would understand that the present tension in the
South is a necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious 
negative peace, in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust
plight, to a substantive and positive peace, in which all men will 
respect the dignity and worth of human personality.  Actually, we 
who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of
tension.  We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is
already alive.  We bring it out in the open, where it can be seen and
dealt with.  Like a boil that can never be cured so long as it is 
covered up but must be opened with all its ugliness to the natural 
medicines of air and light, injustice must be exposed, with all the
tension its exposure creates, to the light of human conscience and
the air of national opinion before it can be cured. 

In your statement your assert that our actions, even though
peaceful, must be condemned because they precipitate violence.  But
is this a logical assertion?  Isn't this like condemning a robbed man
because his possession of money precipitated the evil act of
robbery?  Isn't this like condemning Socrates because his
unswerving commitment to truth and his philosophical inquiries
precipitated the act by the misguided populace in which they made 
him drink hemlock?  Isn't this like condemning Jesus because his
unique God-consciousness and never-ceasing devotion to God's will
precipitated the evil act of crucifixion?  We must come to see that,

brothers.  If today I lived in a Communist country where certain
principles dear to the Christian faith are suppressed, I would openly
advocate disobeying that country's anti-religious laws. 

I must make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and
Jewish brothers.  First, I must confess that over the past few years 
I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. 
I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's
great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White
Citizens Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate,
who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice;  who prefers a
negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace
which is the presence of justice;  who constantly says:  ""I agree
with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods
of direct action"";  who paternalistically believes he can set the
timetable for another man's freedom;  who lives by a mythical 
concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a
""more convenient season.""7  Shallow understanding from people 
of good will is more frustrating than  absolute misunderstanding from 
people of ill will.  Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright
rejection. 

I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law
and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when
they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured

breaks an unjust law must do so openly, lovingly, and with
a willingness to accept the penalty.  I submit that an
individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is
unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of
imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the
community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the
highest respect for law.6 

Of course, there is nothing new about this kind of civil
disobedience.  It was evidenced sublimely in the refusal of Shadrach,
Meshach and Abednego to obey the laws of Nebuchadnezzar, on the
ground that a higher moral law was at stake.  It was practiced
superbly by the early Christians, who were willing to face hungry
lions and the excruciating pain of chopping blocks rather than submit
to certain unjust laws of the Roman Empire.  To a degree, academic 
freedom is a reality today because Socrates practiced civil
disobedience.  In our own nation, the Boston Tea Party represented a
massive act of civil disobedience. 

We should never forget that everything Adolf Hitler did in
Germany was ""legal"" and everything the Hungarian freedom fighters 
did in Hungary was ""illegal"".  It was ""illegal"" to aid and comfort a
Jew in Hitler's Germany.  Even so, I am sure that, had I lived in
Germany at the time, I would have aided and comforted my Jewish

is a code that a majority compels a minority to follow and that it is
willing to follow itself.  This is sameness made legal. 

Let me give another explanation.  A law is unjust if it is
inflicted on a minority that, as a result of being denied the right to
vote, had no part in enacting or devising the law.  Who can say that 
the legislature of Alabama which set up that state's segregation
laws was democratically elected?  Throughout Alabama all sorts of
devious methods are used to prevent Negroes from becoming
registered voters, and there are some counties in which, even though 
Negroes constitute a majority of the population, not a single Negro
is registered.  Can any law enacted under such circumstances be
considered democratically structured? 

Sometimes a law is just on its face and unjust in its
application.  For instance, I have been arrested on a charge of
parading without a permit.  Now, there is nothing wrong in having an
ordinance which requires a permit for a parade.  But such an
ordinance becomes unjust when it is used to maintain segregation
and to deny citizens the First-Amendment privilege of peaceful
assembly and protest. 

I hope you are able to see the distinction I am trying to point
out.  In no sense do I advocate evading or defying the law as would
the rabid segregationist.  That would lead to anarchy.  One who

determine whether a law is just or unjust?  A just law is a man-
made code that squares with the moral law or the law of God.  An
unjust law is a code that is out of harmony with the moral law.  To
put it in the terms of St Thomas Aquinas:  An unjust law is a human 
law that is not rooted in eternal law and natural law.  Any law that 
uplifts human personality is just.  Any law that degrades human
personality is unjust.  All segregation statutes are unjust because 
segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality.  It gives
the segregator a false sense of [inferiority] superiorty.  Segregation, to use the
terminology of the Jewish philosopher Martin Buber, substitutes an
""I-it"" relationship for an ""I-thou"" relationship and ends up relegating
persons to the status of things.  Hence segregation is not only
politically, economically and sociologically unsound, it is morally
wrong and sinful.  Paul Tillich has said that sin is separation.  Is not
segregation as existential expression of man's tragic separation, his
awful estrangement, his terrible sinfulness?  Thus it is that I can 
urge men to obey the 1954 decision of the Supreme Court, for it is
morally right;  and I can urge them to disobey segregation
ordinances, for they are morally wrong. 

Let us consider a more concrete example of just and unjust
laws.  An unjust law is a code that a numerical or power majority
group compels a minority group to obey but does not make binding on 
itself.  This is difference made legal.  By the same token, a just law"

""John,"" and your wife and mother are never given the respected title
""Mrs."";  when you are harried by day and haunted by night by the fact
that you are a Negro, living constantly at tiptoe stance, never quite 
knowing what to expect next, and are plagued with inner fears and
outer resentments;  when you are forever fighting a degenerating
sense of ""nobodiness""--then you will understand why we find it
difficult to wait.  There comes a time when the cup of endurance
runs over, and men are no longer willing to be plunged into the abyss 
of despair.  I hope, sirs, you can understand our legitimate and
unavoidable impatience. 

You express a great deal of anxiety over our willingness to
break laws.  This is certainly a legitimate concern.  Since we so 
diligently urge people to obey the Supreme Court's decision of 1954 
outlawing segregation in the public schools, at first glance it may 
seem rather paradoxical for us consciously to break laws.  One may
well ask:  ""How can you advocate breaking some laws and
obeying others?""  The answer lies in the fact that there 
are two types of laws:  just and unjust.  I would be the first to
advocate obeying just laws.  One has not only a legal but a moral 
responsibility to obey just laws.  Conversely, one has a moral 
responsibility to disobey unjust laws.  I would agree with St.
Augustine that ""an unjust law is no law at all.""

independence, but we still creep at horse-and-buggy pace toward 
gaining a cup of coffee at a lunch counter.  Perhaps it is easy for
those who have never felt the stinging darts of segregation to say,

fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at whim; when
you have seen hate-filled policemen curse, kick and even kill your
black brothers and sisters; when you see the vast majority of your

poverty in the midst of an affluent society; when you suddenly find 
your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you seek to

to form in her little mental sky, and see her beginning to distort her
personality by developing an unconscious bitterness toward white 
people; when you have to concoct an answer for a five-year-old son 
who is asking:  ""Daddy, why do white people treat colored people so

dedicated to maintenance of the status quo.  I have hope that Mr.
Boutwell will be reasonable enough to see the futility of massive
resistance to desegregaton.  But he will not see this without 
pressure from devotees of civil rights.  My friends, I must say to you 
that we have not made a single gain in civil rights  without
determined legal and nonviolent pressure.  Lamentably, it is an
historical fact that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges
voluntarily.  Individuals may see the moral light and voluntarily give
up their unjust posture; but, as Reinhold Niebuhr has reminded us, 
groups tend to be more immoral than individuals. 

We know through painful experience that freedom is
never voluntarily given by the oppressor;  it must be
demanded by the oppressed.  Frankly I have yet to engage
in a direct-action campaign that was ""well timed"" in the 
view of those who have not suffered unduly from the
disease of segregation.4  For years now I have heard 
the word ""Wait!""  It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing
familiarity.  This ""Wait"" has almost always meant ""Never.""  We must 
come to see, with one of our distinguished jurists, that ""justice too
long delayed is justice denied."" 

We have waited for more than 340 years for our
constitutional and God-given rights.5  The nations of Asia and
Africa are moving with jetlike speed toward gaining political

there is a type of constructive, nonviolent tension which is
necessary for growth.  Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary
to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from 
the bondage of myths and half-truths to the unfettered realm of
creative analysis and objective appraisal, so must we see the need
for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that
will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and racism to
the majestic heights of understanding and brotherhood. 

The purpose of our direct-action program is to create a
situation so crisis-packed that it will inevitably open the door to
negotiation.  Too long has our beloved Southland been bogged 
down in a tragic effort to live in monologue rather than
dialogue.3 

One of the basic points in your statement is that the action
that I and my associates have taken in Birmingham is untimely.
Some have asked:  ""Why didn't you give the new city administration
time to act?""  The only answer that I can give to this query is that
the new Birmingham administration must be prodded about as much
as the outgoing one before it will act.  We are sadly mistaken if we
feel that the election of Albert Boutwell as mayor will bring the
millennium to Birmingham.  While Mr. Boutwell is a much more
gentle person than Mr. Connor, they are both segregationists, 

"
Rosa Parks: In Her Own Words,Icon in the Making,"Rosa Parks Papers: Events, 1951-2005; Featuring or honoring Parks; 1990",mss859430248,mss859430248-33,completed,http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:mss:mss85943:0019:15:0033/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg,"5 

withdrawal program would be the by-product of direct action, we
felt that this would be the best time to bring pressure to bear on the
merchants for the needed change. 

Then it occurred to us that Birmingham's mayoralty election
was coming up in March, and we speedily decided to postpone action
until after election day.  When we discovered that the Commissioner
of Public Safety, Eugene ""Bull"" Connor, had piled up enough votes to
be in the run-off, we decided again to postpone action until the day 
after the run-off so that the demonstrations could not be used to
cloud the issues.  Like many others, we waited to see Mr. Connor 
defeated, and to this end we endured postponement after 
postponement.  Having aided in this community need, we felt that our 
direct-action program could be delayed no longer. 

You may well ask:  ""Why direct action?  Why sit-ins, marches
and so forth?  Isn't negotiation a better path?""  You are quite right in
calling for negotiation.  Indeed, this is the very purpose of direct 
action.  Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and
foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused 
to negotiate is forced to confront the issue.  It seeks so to
dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored.  My citing the
creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent-resister
may sound rather shocking.  But I must confess that I am not afraid
of the word ""tension.""  I have earnestly opposed violent tension, but"
Rosa Parks: In Her Own Words,Icon in the Making,"Rosa Parks Papers: Events, 1951-2005; Featuring or honoring Parks; 1990",mss859430248,mss859430248-32,completed,http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:mss:mss85943:0019:15:0032/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg,"4 

Then, last September, came the opportunity to talk with
leaders of Birmingham's economic community.  In the course of the
negotiations, certain promises were made by the merchants --for 
example, to remove the stores' humiliating racial signs.  On the
basis of these promises, the Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth and the
leaders of the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights agreed 
to a moratorium on all demonstrations.  As the weeks and months 
went by, we realized that we were the victims of a broken promise. 
A few signs, briefly removed, returned; the others remained. 

As in so many past experiences, our hopes had been blasted, 
and the shadow of deep disappointment settled upon us.  We had no
alternative except to prepare for direct action, whereby we
would present our very bodies as a means of laying our 
case before the conscience of the local and national 
community.  Mindful of the difficulties involved, we
decided to undertake a process of self-purification.  We
began a series of workshops on nonviolence, and we
repeatedly asked ourselves:  ""Are you able to accept blows 
without retaliating?""  ""Are you able to endure the ordeal of
jail?""2  We decided to schedule our direct-action program for
the Easter season, realizing that except for Christmas, this is the
main shopping period of the year.  Knowing that a strong economic-

its bounds. 

You deplore the demonstrations taking place in Birmingham.
But your statement, I am sorry to say, fails to express a similar
concern for the conditions that brought about the demonstrations.  I
am sure that none of you would want to rest content with the
superficial kind of social analysis that deals merely with effects 
and does not grapple with underlying causes.  It is unfortunate that
demonstrations are taking place in Birmingham, but it is even more
unfortunate that the city's white power structure left the Negro 
community with no alternative. 

In any nonviolent campaign, there are four basic steps: 
collection of the facts to determine whether injustices exist; 
negotiation; self-purification; and direct action.  We have gone
through all these steps in Birmingham.  There can be no gainsaying
the fact that racial injustice engulfs this community.  Birmingham 
is probably the most thoroughly segregated city in the United States. 
Its ugly record of brutality is widely known.  Negroes have 
experienced grossly unjust treatment in the courts.  There have been 
more unsolved bombings of Negro homes and churches in Birmingham 
than in any other city in the nation.  These are the hard, brutal facts 
of the case.  On the basis of these conditions, Negro leaders sought 
to negotiate with the city fathers.  But the latter consistently
refused to engage in good-faith negotiation.

in Birmingham asked us to be on call to engage in a nonviolent
direct-action program if such were deemed necessary.  We readily 
consented, and when the hour came, we lived up to our promise.  So I,
along with several members of my staff, am here because I was
invited here.  I am here because I have organizational ties here. 

But more basically, I am in Birmingham because injustice is
here. Just as the prophets of the eighth century B.C. left their
villages and carried their ""thus saith the Lord"" far beyond the
boundaries of their home towns, and just as the Apostle Paul left his
village of Tarsus and carried the gospel of Jesus Christ to the far 
corners of the Greco-Roman world, so am I compelled to carry the
gospel of freedom beyond my own home town.  Like Paul, I must
constantly respond to the Macedonian call for aid. 

Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all 
communities and states.  I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and
not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. 
Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.1  We 
are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single
garment of destiny.  Whatever affects one directly, affects all
indirectly.  Never again can we afford to live with the narrow,
provincial ""outside agitator"" idea.  Anyone who lives inside the
United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere within

ROSA PARKS AMERICAN HEROINE
How One Person Can Make A Difference 

Rosa Parks is an individual who made a significant contribution to
history.  This one woman was a catalyst in the Civil Rights movement, and 
her singled efforts helped change society.  In addition to her direct
involvement within the Civil Rights movement, she also encouraged other to
organize and form powerful groups.  Rosa Parks believed in finding the way
needed to make a permanent, effective change. 
Rosa's ideas and values were first instilled in her by her family.  Her
mother was an especially strong influence.  She taught Rosa that the true 
concept of equality did not lie in the pigment of one's skin, amount of money
or material things.  The concept of equality was based on an individual's
worth, and respect of one person to another.  Rosa grew up neither hating
herself nor whites, but hating the system that caused the inequalities and
oppression that she had to face on a daily basis. 
The quest for equal rights was a cause that Rosa decided to dedicate
herself.  She served for several years as youth advisor for the NAACP in
Montgomery.  She also joined the Montgomery Voters League, and pleaded 
with her people to register to vote.  As a result, a very high percentage of
Blacks registered and showed their support. 
Rosa Parks is most famous for her involvement in the incident that
helped influence the Montgomery bus boycott.  She was arrested for refusing
to give up her seat to a white man, and her arrest was seen as an
opportunity to rally for desegregation. 
Though the struggle for Civil Rights was being fought intensely by others, 
Rosa's incident lowered the level of tolerance among Blacks.  Until her
momemt of defiance, the Jim Crow laws concerning transportation had not 
been challenged in such a direct way.  As a result of her strong will and
determination, Rosa was able to instill a new sense of dignity and racial 
pride into the Black Community, as all attention became focused on
Montgomery. 
A stand taken by one person can be the spark that ignites the remainder
of the group.  In most cases, one person must be the initiator, which was
what Rosa Parks instantly became when she refused to move.  That single 
effort made the difference that effected the entire Civil Rights movement, 
and simultaneously made Rosa Parks a heroine in the eyes of many."

How one person can make a difference.

There is about her name no discernible ring nor aura of
distinction. There is about her dress and manner no singular,
commanding, or memorable uniqueness.  Her story, however is one of the 
most inspirational to come out of the civil rights movement, a simple 
message to all that human dignity cannot interminably be undermined by
brute force.
On the evening of December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks boarded a public bus
in Montgomery, Alabama, took a seat with the other passengers, and 
prepared to relax for 15 minutes or so before arriving home.  As the bus
began to fill up, however, the number of seats dwindled until, within a 
few minutes, there were none left.  As soon as the white bus driver
noticed that a black woman was occupying a seat in the ""white"" section 
of the bus while a white passenger was standing, he ordered the 
""offender"" to the rear.
The ""offender"" did not make a scene when she refused.  She did not
scream; she did not whine; she did not threaten; she did not exhort.
She simply did not move, thus forcing those who would force her to move
to make the next move.  Rosa Parks was arrested, jailed, and brought to
trial while the rest of the once quiescent black community refused to 
ride public busses.  Mrs. Parks was the catalyst in the Montgomery 
boycott, the first public confrontation which brought the name of Martin
Luther King, Jr., into the ears of America.

HOW ONE PERSON CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE 

A Montgomery, Alabama seamstress, Rosa Parks, decided on
December 1, 1955 that because she was tired, she would not give
up her seat on the bus to a white man as the law required.  Mrs. 
Parks went to jail and became the catalyst for the successful 
Montgomery bus boycott let by a new community activist, 26 year-old
Baptist minister, Martin Luther King Jr. 
The success of the bus boycott encouraged a wave of massive
demonstrations that swept across the South like a floodtide. 
Mrs. Parks paid dearly for her courage.  Her husband, a 
barber, became ill from pressure caused by     bigotry.  The family
ultimately moved to Detroit, where Mr. Parks resumed his
profession.  Mrs. Parks, a seamstress did alterations for
customers in her home until she found a job as a dressmaker. 
In Detroit, she became a community activist and worked with
youth in the areas of cultural exposure and recreation.  Dr. 
King, once called her ""the great fuse that led to the modern
stride while sitting still. 
Mrs. Parks is presently a receptionist secretary to U.S. 
Representative John Conyers.  A religious person, she serves as 
deaconess of St. Matthews A.M.E. Church in Detroit.  She accepts 
many speaking engagements because she wants to help ""young people
grow, develop, and reach their potential."""

It is an insensitive nation that profess
equality of opportunity when its daughters have not the same 
economic promise as sons, and when blacks have not the same 
training to run the economic race as whites.
For far too many, the promise of America is but an
endless nightmare, in which African American families have
more young males in prison than in college; a structural
trauma, where fatherless households are more common than 
fathered; a systemic nightmare, where African and latino
citizens have neither the air or boat licensure nor
resources to be instrumental in drug trafficking, but are
painted as national villains in, and suffer
disproportionally from this plague.  Thirty-five years
later, it is a sheeted nightmare revisited, when programs
and policy designed to redress centuries of racial inequity
are dismissed as reversed discrimination.  it is indeed an
attitude of hooded pathology, which makes our streets battle
fields, our college campuses seed beds of racial
intolerance, which grant to white immigrants a level of
privilege, denied to Americans of color who have fundamental
residency in America.  For too many, life is a bitter sweet
reality in which Germany can be divided and reunited, in
which the Eastern bloc nations can shed the shackles of
communism more easily than, and before all American can 
taste the full flower of democracy exercised through total 
equality of opportunity.  As America approaches the twenty
first century, it must reclaim the moral initiative started

fangs of racism and segregation persist, empowered by the
absence of a national agenda to make America whole.  In this
void, death and misery are increasingly the common umbilical
experiences of the nation's racial minorities. 
The Emmett Till Syndrome is revisited too often from
Boston to Los Angeles;  revisited in communities in which
African Americans cannot walk [under] without fear of death, revisited
on American college campuses and in resort towns;  revisited
by the negative, the punitive cultural label attached to
being young, male and black in America.  Over three decades 
ago, Dr. King asked America, ""how long . . .""  and the foul 
answer has been, ""not yet!""  For Native Americans remain
entrapped on rural reservations with their elders too
experienced to and the young seeing little for which to
hope.  Millions of African and Latino Americans suffer the
trauma of inner city plantation life.  Their life 
expectancy, and infant mortality rates shorter and higher
than in the most dismal third world nations.  In America,
the signs, ""whites only"", are no longer visible, but the
tradition remains in the national fabric, remains as a 
cancerous appendage in the national habit, custom and
memory.  America is not yet whole when economic segregation
remains as foreboding an obstacle as is race specific
privilege.  The National soul is wanting, when the
economically able chase monetary gain without offering a
humanist glance nor policy hand to a displaced and unseen"

thrust the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King into
international prominence; and forever changed the face of
America and the world. 
Thirty-five years later, the face of America has
changed, there are legislative, institutional, indeed human
examples of racial progress.  However, this progress has 
been beneficial to the few, is inadequate to the realities
of the many;  the death and suffering attendant under this
sunrise of resurrection are in sum, a dim commentary of
national indifference toward moral balance and racial 
equity.  The face of America is exalted on the western 
geopolitical landscape, but the character of the national 
soul is not yet whole.  All Americans are not yet included 
in this monumental experiment in participatory democracy.
America lingers in a moral abyss, its mystical voice 
dominating the chambers of international bodies calling for
universal humanity;  while its domestic hand, remains idle in
the face of increasing racial economic segregation.  The
Movement has matured, but its work is yet in gestation.
Many of the leaders and workers of the modern civil rights 
movement are gone.  Through omnipotent grace Rosa remains
among us.  But gone is the national spirit to confront
injustice through collective goodwill, gone is the
willingness to honestly face and eradicate historical
inequity.  Today, the ""dogs"" are gone, as are the overt
symbols and policies of racial segregation, but the covert

Dear Friend:
You are cordially invited to participate with me in the 
celebration of my 77th birthday in Washington, D. C., at the 
John F. Kennedy Center for the Preforming Arts on Sunday,
February 04, 1990, 6:30 in the evening.

This national tribute is being coordinated by the Rosa Parks
Tribute Committee of Washington, D.C. and will feature civic
leaders, activists, and many, many celebrities.

A portion of the proceeds from this gala event will benefit
my lifetime dream, The Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for 
Self Development (named in honor of myself and my late 
husband). The Institute was created to help motivate youth
throughout the country, between the ages of eleven and 
seventeen, to reach their highest potential in life. The 
national model is being established here in Detroit,
Michigan, my home since 1957.

IN TRIBUTE TO ROSA PARKS

Professor Franklin O. Smith
Stockton State College
May 4, 1990 

Thirty-five years ago in Montgomery, Alabama a moral
sunrise burst upon a nation clouded by racial segregation,
and human injustice.  This sunray of justice and moral hope
emerged when Rosa Parks refused to relinquish her seat on a 
segregated Montgomery bus.  With a resolve understated by a 
highly dignified demeanor, with a strength cultivated by a
life of dedicated activism, informed by the historical 
inequity common to America, Rosa Parks said, ""No.  I'm Not!"" 
On that fateful day of December 1, 1955, the weariness of
bone and spirit; a person, a people and a world in
deliberate quest for human justice, converged with
historical force, giving birth to the modern civil rights 
movement; and established Rosa Parks as its ""Grand
Matriarch"".  Rosa's singular act of defiance against racial 
injustice became ""THE INCIDENT"" around which the Montgomery
Bus Boycott was framed; her gallantry, galvanized the
nation; served as the monumental experience which would"

circumstances will soon make it possible for me to meet each of
you, not as an integrationist or a civil-rights leader but as a fellow
clergyman and a Christian brother.  Let us all hope that the dark
clouds of racial prejudice will soon pass away and the deep fog of
misunderstanding will be lifted from our fear-drenched
communities, and in some not too distant tomorrow the radiant
stars of love and brotherhood will shine over our great nation with
all their scintillating beauty.

was founded February 14, 1987 in Albany, New York, by concerned African Americans 
from across the State. 

NYSAAPAC is composed of African American members of nearly all of the political
parties active in New York State, who, individually and collectively are the ""decision makers, mover and shakers"" on behalf of social and civic concerns in their respective communities of residence across New York State. NYSAAPAC is a non-partisan organization. Regardless of their political party affiliation, they are united in their belief that African American elected officials should strive to improve the quality of life available to all their constituents. 

The primary founding principle of NYSAAPAC is that political power should be 
utilized to benefit the collective interests of the communities which produce it, as opposed
to the personal agendas of those elected to wield it. To that end, NYSAAPAC
is more concerned with the quality, than the quantity, of African American elected officials. 

Therefore, NYSAAPAC has always honored, and will continue to support and respect, those African Americans who have, through their energies and actions, worked to improve the quality of life of their fellow African Americans, regardless of personal sacrifice or hardship.

Action Committee takes great pride in presenting
the 1990 Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. Legislative
Achievement Award to Mrs. Rosa L. Parks. 
Mrs. Rosa L. Parks, is widely known for her
history making decision not to relinquish her seat
to a white passenger on a segregated bus on
December 1, 1955, in Montgomery, Alabama. She
was arrested for ""disobeying the law"", an act which 
sparked a boycott of Montgomery, Alabama buses,
lasting one year, two weeks and two days and officially
launched the Civil Rights Movement in the
United States. 
She was born February 4, 1913 in Tuskegee,
Alabama, and moved to Montgomery with her
mother and brother in 1924. Mrs. Parks was a 
graduate of Montgomery Industrial School, where 
she developed sewing skills;  and attended 
Alabama State College, one of the normal schools
financed by the state to provide college training
for African Americans. 
She met her husband, Raymond Parks, a
barber, in Montgomery in 1931. They were married
the following year.  Rosa and Raymond
became involved in the internationally publicized
case of the Scottsboro Boys through their affiliation
with the NAACP. Raymond Parks, one
of the few African American men to take an official 
stand in the case, operated through
underground means because of the threat of lynching
prevalent at that time in the south.  Mrs. 
Parks as actively involved with two of the Scottsboro 
Boys-Clarence Norris and Andy Wright,
where she spoke in their behalf, when they left
Alabama in violation of their parole. 
She and her husband were charter members of
the Alabama State of NAACP Council.  She was a
member of the Montgomery Voters League which 
focused its attention on preparing African
Americans to qualify for voting privileges. In
1955, Mrs. Parks attended the Highlander School
in Tennessee, developed for ""organizers to lead
disenfranchised black and whites to exercise their 

democratic rights as American citizens."" 
Her courage brought to the forefront Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr.,  the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference (SCLC), the Voting Rights 
Act of 1957, a Fair Housing Practice ruling in
New York City. 
Mrs. Parks, who served as receptionist/
secretary to Congressman John Conyers from 
1965 to 1988, is the recipient of the Martin Luther
King Humanitarian Award from College University
in Rochester, New York; the NAACP Spingarn 
Medal, UAW Social Justice Award and the B'Nai
B'rith Humanitarian Award. In Detroit, her home
since 1956, 12th Street has been renamed Rosa
Parks Boulevard. 
Her beloved husband, Raymond, passed in
1977. In 1987 Mrs. Parks founded the Rosa and
Raymond Parks Institute for Self-Development, to
fulfill the dream of two individuals who have 
dedicated their lives to Civil Rights. The Institute
provides unique programs to foster and present 
leadership through outreaching to youth and
young adults, challenging them to create fresh 
perspectives, examine new approaches and improve
their quality of life. Rosa Parks has provided
a legacy of dignity, courage with
perseverance, power with discipline.

Minority businesses represent a major investment at General Motors.

In dollars, our purchases
from minority businesses
amounted to over $390 million
last year alone. 
More than 1,400 minority-
owned companies shared in that
business. 
They're good, solid companies. 
Dependable and capable.  Today,
we're proud of the fact that
minority-owned companies help
produce components for every
General Motors vehicle
manufactured in the U.S.
But that's not all.
During 1983, General Motors
placed $3.8 million in advertising
with minority media.
General Motors tax deposits
through minority banks totaled
over $931 million.  
Minority insurance
firms provided $10.9 billion
in property damage coverage
for General Motors. 


Payments for Corporate
construction contracts to minority
businesses totaled $30.4 million.
General Motors Minority
Enterprise Small Business Investment
Company, since 1970, has
provided financial assistance to
161 minority companies valued at
$5.9 million.  These funds have
enabled these companies to borrow
an additional $36.6 million.
At year's end, GM dealerships
owned and operated by minorities
numbered 162.  And dealerships
owned and operated by women
numbered 133.  Also, since 1972, 100
minorities have graduated from
GM's Dealer Development Training
Academy.
As we said, minority businesses
represent a major investment at
General Motors.
And results have
shown that our faith in
them has paid off.

When we think about the separation of Church and State,
maybe we should try to start near the beginning.

If you want to make a wise decision concerning an important 
subject, you must identify the available options and check each 
option against a list of relevant values which you accept.

You may test your options by referring to your own divine
relevation. You may accept certain principles solely because of your 
interpretation of holy scriptures or the teachings of some religious 
leader in whom you have confidence.

You may often find that your theological values and your utilitarian 
values point to the same conclusion. But sometimes you may find a 
conflict between these two value systems, and you will have to 
choose one or the other. So far as your own beliefs are concerned,
you must feel perfectly free to make this sort of decision in the way 
that you consider to be best. Whatever you decide, you may express
your decision to others and try to persuade them to agree with you.

But we must not seek or permit governmental action unless most 
of our people can be persuaded that the action is good for reasons
independent of divine revelation, or an interpretation of holy
scripture or dogmatic religious teachings. This is one of the most
important meanings of the separation of Church and State. 
                                  - Lloyd M. Smith 




Enough of this profundity Lloyd. Let us look at the here and now of
the issue. Let us look at  how some practioners of what they allege to
be religious leadership are corrupting the political process. 

I hated it, but I could not object when Cardinal Spellman, machine 
gun in hand, applauded the Vietnam war. Nor, on the other hand, 
could I or would I object when and Reverence, be it Martin Luther
King or Jesse Jackson, stated their political piece.

What the Falwell types are doing that none of the aforementioned 
are is to invoke sin- and they are doing it with an authority that is 
overpowering. When an innocent is told  that the wrong position on
subjects even like Panama or the Department of Education will
deprive him of salvation, then you have a mix of religion and politics
that is qualitively different from what Spellman or King or Jackson
have engaged in. Especially at a time when so many are aware of 
Khomeni in Iran, we should be particularly sensitive to the invocation
of the threat of eternal damnation in the political process here. 

   Fear removes any vestige of reason from the political process.
And, dammit, reason is what places us above animals. The 
democratic political process- the heritage so arduously struggled
for- is what is at stake.
      But why all the words; Lloyd Smith says it better
                                   - Stanley K. Sheinbaum

each year at the celebration of the anniversary of the Bill of 
Rights in memory of the man who was, for 20 years, the 
executive direction of the ACLU of Southern California.  It 
calls to mind not only his lifelong dedication to the cause of 
civil liberties and civil rights but even more, the courageous 
personal stand he made for freedom.  At a critical moment 
in the hysteria of the McCarthy period, he was fired from 
his academic position after he refused to sign the so-called 
state loyalty oath, the Levering oath, and gave up his 
chosen career as professor at California State University in 
San Francisco.

Memphis, Selma, Birmingham... Is there any one among us 
who does not feel both exhilaration and sorrow when we hear 
those names?  They are places in our hearts as well as in our 
history, and they signify what we have gained as well as what we 
have lost... and what we have yet to do.
Those places, and that exhilaration and sorrow, are part of the 
personal and political history of Pastor James Lawson whom the 
ACLU of Southern California is honoring with its Eason Monroe 
Courageous Advocate Award.
Exposure to the indignity, the cruelty of racism did not, 
course, begin for Jim with the onset of the civil rights movement in 
the 60's.  When did he first experience it?  ""Practically before I was 
old enough to walk,"" he remembers, when he was called ""nigger"" 
on the streets of the small Ohio town in which he grew up.  Born to 
a socially conscious family, Jim learned to fight back against such 
insults, first with his fists when he was in elementary school and 
later with the methods of non-violence.
He came naturally to the tradition of activism.  His father, also a 
minister as was his grandfather, organized chapters of the 
NAACP and the Urban League in Jamestown and Syracuse, New 
York and Masselin, Ohio.  His great grandfather was an escaped 
slave from Hagerstown, Maryland who carried his young son on 
the underground railroad to freedom.  It wasn't long before young 

Jim Lawson put into practice the principles of resistance to racism 
that he had learned from his family.  When he was only 16, he 
participated in a sit-in in his hometown of Masselin, Ohio, where he 
and a white friend were refused service at a diner.
In 1951, two months before his graduation from college, he was 
sent to prison for sending his draft card back to Selective Service 
Headquarters and served 14 months of a three-year sentence.  The 
prison sentence temporarily detoured but did not destroy two 
ambitions which had developed while he was an undergraduate: to 
live outside the U.S. in an entirely different culture, and to work in 
the South in the movement against segregation.
The first ambition was fulfilled shortly after he was released from 
prison when the United Methodist Church sent him for three 
years to India to work as a coach and a campus minister, where he 
became more influenced by the philosophy of Ghandi whose 
writings he had begin to study while in college.
The second ambition was fulfilled in 1957 when he went to work 
in the South for the Fellowship of Reconciliation.  Shortly before 
that move, he had met Martin Luther King when King came to 
speak at Oberlin College where Jim was attending the Graduate 
School of Theology.  King had urged Jim to go South has soon as 
possible - the movement needed him.  Indeed, everything that 
made Jim Lawson the man he was at that historic moment - the 
philosophy of non-violence, as a strategy for change, his analytic 
mind, his involvement in the church, his courage to resist injustice, 
and his organizing and leadership skills - meshed with the needs of 
the burgeoning civil rights movement.  From the moment King's 
and Lawson's paths crossed, until the moment of King's death in 
1968 in Memphis, they were friends, colleagues, brothers.
After serving three years with the FOR, Jim took a position with 
the Southern Christian Leadership Conference as a director of 
non-violent education from 1960 to 1972.  Called the foremost 
non-violent theorist in the movement by King, he was, at the same 
time, fully involved in organizing and direct action.  In fact, very few 
of the leaders in the movement were part of so many campaigns.  
One of the founders, along with King and Ella Baker, of the 
Student Non Violent Coordinating Committee, Jim was also the 
coordinator of the Freedom Rides in 1961, the organizer of the 
Nashville sit-ins which began in 1958, and advance staff person in 
1963 for the Birmingham campaign.
From 1962 to 1974, he planned and directed a series of action 
campaigns in Memphis opposing police brutality and discrimination 
in schools, employment and public accommodations.  In 1968, 
he was chairman of the strategy committee for the Memphis 
Sanitation workers' strike, during which King was assassinated.
Since 1974, Jim has been pastor at Holman United Methodist 
Church in Los Angeles. President of SCLC in Los Angeles, he is 
also vice president of the national organization.  In addition, he is 
president of the Peace With Justice Leadership Conference, a 
coalition of some 60 denominational and community groups, and 
serves on the advisory councils of Clergy and Laity Concerned 
and the Fellowship of Reconciliation.
Right after Jim moved to California with his wife, Dorothy, and 
his three sons, John, Morris, and Seth, he became a passionate 
participant again in the struggle for school integration.  It was with
some irony that he observed that moving North meant transferring 
from a city of integrated schools in Memphis to a city of 
segregated schools in Los Angeles.
His has been a prophetic voice in the Southern California community, 
and his church has been a center of social action.  Active in 
the farmworkers' boycott while in Memphis, he began to organize 
support for the farmworkers' cause as soon as he became pastor 
at Holman.  Under his leadership, the church has been deeply 
involved in poor people's struggles through the Interfaith Hunger 
Coalition and the farmers' market program, and it has consistently 
been a center of peace action.
Throughout his life, Jim Lawson, like Martin King, has tried to 
raise people's consciousness and conscience about the powerful
 interconnections of racism, war and poverty.  Despite the heavy 
resistance in both the black and white communities, both men 
agreed that opposition to the Vietnam War was inextricably linked 
to the movement for civil rights, and all the training workshops 


organized by Jim, starting with the Nashville Movement in 1960, 
made that connection.  Etched in his memory is the famous, prophetic 
speech of King in 1967 at New York's Riverside Church in 
which he predicted that if we didn't change America then by 
dealing with the roots of war in Southeast Asia, in another decade 
or so we would be involved in wars in Central America and South 
Africa.
By the time of the Poor People's Campaign in 1968, King, along 
with Jim and a number of colleagues, had become convinced that 
American society must also deal with the roots of poverty and try 
to bring about structural change in an economy that had been built 
on slavery and exploitation, and which maintained a colonial relationship 
to Third World countries.  Connecting issues of racism 
and poverty, which King told Jim in a private conversation he had 
been starting to do in the Poor People's Campaign, led King in 
1968 to join the Memphis garbage workers' strike, of which Jim 
was the coordinator.
Today when one asks Jim Lawson, ""Who is the number one 
enemy of peace and justice in the world?"" he answers, unequivocally, 
""It is the United States.""  While we give lip service, in his view, 
to the goals of democracy, peace and equality, our national policies 
have produced an escalation of violence and militarism in the 
world, a strengthening of right wing dictatorships, and intensified 
oppression and repression in countries which we support.
Somehow, Jim emphasizes, progressive forces must come 
together again as they did in the 60's to change America.  But he 
warns that any movement is doomed which does not face up to the 
fact, as W.B. DuBois put it, that ""The problem of the 20th century 
is the problem of the color line.""  That issue, which at bottom is 
""the issue of human dignity and worth,"" must be joined to the 
struggle for peace and economic justice.  Consciousness-raising 
about racism and its effects is a continuing need in our churches, 
synagogues and organizations, and it must be carried out across 
racial, religious and ethnic lines if it is to be truly effective.  It's tough 
work, Jim admits, and most of us avoid it, but it must be done.
Jim's commitment to principle has required many sacrifices 
from him, and from his family, and he is prepared to make more if 
events require it.  Solely for exercising his constitutional rights and 
living by the claims of conscience, he has been jailed many times, 
first in 1951-1952 as a draft resister, subsequently for civil rights 
actions in West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee and Mississippi, 
and again in 1981 for praying on the White House grounds.  There 
is a strong possibility that he may serve time in a California jail as 
well if the Reagan Administration launches an invasion in Central 
America.  He has already told his congregation he is prepared to 
commit civil disobedience in protest against such an illegal and 
immoral act.
Although these are ""terrible times"" for a man like Jim Lawson, 
he reminds us that in the midst of our doubts and fears, it is 
important to remember the hope, exhilaration and sense of personal 
fulfillment that were a part of the civil rights movement and 
that must be continually renewed if we are not going ""to yield to 
darkness.""  He will continue to inspire us to believe in that power 
""to change America"" and to act on the vision of a world where, as 
Martin Luther King said, peace is not the absence of tension but 
the presence of justice.

drive to deliver the promise of equality to every person, the 
civil rights and civil liberties guarantees need special care to 
bring them to life.
Eleanor Holmes Norton's life has been marked by an unwavering 
dedication to achieving justice for all.
After graduation from Yale Law School, Norton clerked 
for one of the most distinguished federal judges whose decisions 
helped advance the struggle for equality, Judge A. Leon 
Higginbotham.
Following her clerkship, she spent five years as the Assistant 
Legal Director of the American Civil Liberties Union.  Holmes 
came to this position just a few months after the signing of 
the historic Civil Rights Act of 1964.
The cases that followed began the enormous task of enforcing 
the 1964 law.  In 1965, the historic Voting Rights Act was 
signed.  The ACLU, with Norton helping to shape the legal 
program, took to the courts to open up franchise rights 
through elimination of the poll tax, literacy and ""good moral 
character"" qualifications.
Compliance with the letter of the law was almost too easy, 
compliance with the spirit of the law has been too hard.
The ACLU moved from striking down the barriers to voting 
to striking down the barriers to representation.  Apportionment 
lines drawn to dilute voting strength were challenged 
as Andrew Young became the first black to serve in Congress 
from Georgia.
Challenges were made to discrimination in public accommodations.  
Civil rights demonstrators were freed from the 
threat of state prosecutions for peaceful picketing of segregated 
establishments and practices.
""Operation Southern Justice"" was launched to end the 
exclusion of blacks from juries after all white juries freed 
several men accused of killing two Freedom Riders in the 
summer of 1965.
But with the Watts Rebellion of 1965, the nation could no 
longer hide the fact that discrimination was not confined to 
the overt practices of the South.
Norton played a key role in developing ACLU cases in all 
of these areas, as well as all of the other areas ACLU was 
involved in.  Even representing the right of those who advocated 
racial hatred and bigotry against her race to speak in 
a public forum.
Norton continued to shape the civil rights struggle after 
leaving the ACLU.  She became the chair of the New York 
City Commission on Human Rights.  For seven years she 
served as the chief policymaker and implementer of New 
York City's anti-discrimination office, the New York City 
Commission on Human Rights.
As chair, Eleanor Holmes Norton worked to end discrimination 
in jobs, housing and all areas of public accommodations.
What she had done so forcefully in New York, Norton took on 
at a national level when she was named the first woman to serve 
as head of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
As Chair of the EEOC under President Carter, Norton 
developed a powerful weapon for enforcing Title VII of the 
1964 Civil Rights Act and other federal anti-discrimination 
laws passed to prevent discrimination on the basis of age, 
physical or mental disability and unequal pay on the basis 
of gender.
Today the EEOC has been effectively dismantled.  But 
Eleanor Holmes Norton remains hard at work in the struggle 
to achieve equality under the Constitution and the Bill of 
Rights.  Norton remains a leader of the movement to end 
discrimination as a public spokesperson and as a teacher.
A professor of law at Georgetown University Law Center, 
Norton develops the spirit to fight against discrimination 
in the students in her classes.
What she teaches is what she has learned so well in a career 
which has been constant in its dedication to the principles of 
justice.  Norton teaches that all men - and all women - are 
created equal.  Assuring their unalienable rights requires the 
constant vigilance of many and the leadership of those, like 
Norton, who are unwavering in their commitment to the dignity 
of each individual.
Norton continues to be a part of the ACLU, serving as 
chair of the National Advisory Council.

Next month, Congressman Edward R. Roybal begins his 
23rd year in the U.S. Congress.
Roybal is a rarity in the Congress, and perhaps it is a little 
known fact that should not be too talked about.  But Representative 
Roybal is one of the best elected officials from the 
ACLU's point of view, with just about a perfect voting record.
Roybal has been a key legislator in protecting people's rights 
- especially consumers' rights, health rights, and the rights 
of the elderly.
Roybal began his career in public as a health educator in 
the 1940s in California.  That expertise served Los Angeles 
well following Roybal's election to the City Council in 1949.
In his 13 years on this governing body, he served as Chair 
of the Public Health and Welfare Committee.  Roybal worked 
to increase the effectiveness of the city's job training, public 
health and social service programs.
With his election to Congress in 1962, Roybal took his 
concerns about the health and welfare of the people to a national 
forum.
Roybal's career includes authorship of the Bilingual Education 
Act and sponsorship of critical legislation to extend the 
reach and effectiveness of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
In addition, he helped create the work-study program to 
enable low and middle income students to pay the costs of a 
college education.
And he has been a leading representative of Hispanic 
interests, authorizing legislation requiring the Census Bureau 
and other government information collecting agencies to more 
accurately maintain data on Hispanic Americans.
Roybal holds key posts on two Appropriations Committees' 
subcommittees.  Those positions have enabled him to 
play a key role in restoring or minimizing cuts in federal money 
for education and to broaden support for health care for the 
elderly, the newborn and their mothers, migrant workers, 
children with disabilities and others who cannot provide sufficient 
health care for themselves.
Congressman Roybal knows well that the health of the entire 
society suffers when the health of any group suffers.
For the past 10 years, Roybal has served on the Select 
Committee on Aging and as Chair of its Subcommittee on 
Housing and Consumer Interests.  In 1976, he applied his 
Appropriations Committee skills to his Select Committee role 
and won funding for Senior Center programs and other 
benefits for the elderly.
But we honor him tonight for all of these reasons and one 
critical reason more.  Of over 500 members of Congress, 
none played a more crucial role in preventing passage of 
repressive immigration laws than Edward Roybal.
Roybal led the opposition to the Simpson-Mazzoli Immigration
and Reform Control Act for two years.
In 1980, pressure began to mount for ""reform"" of our 
nation's immigration bills after a large number of immigrants 
came into the country at the same time the economy was 
depressed.
Responding to a public perception that these new residents 
were to blame for unemployment and inflation, the Administration 
introduced a bill in 1981 giving the Executive authority 
to declare an ""immigration emergency"" and to suspend 
constitutional guarantees.
In 1982, the Simpson-Mazzoli bill was introduced as a more 
""moderate"" response to the immigration question.  But the 
bill suspended fundamental principles of due process and 
eliminated judicial review in asylum cases.
Other provisions included employee sanctions for hiring 
undocumented workers, reinstating the ""guest worker"" program, 
and suspending judicial review.  Edward Roybal led the 
effort to defeat the measure.
In many cases, Roybal found himself under attack by liberal 
legislators who accused him of being anti-labor because he 
was unwilling to suspend constitutional rights.
But perhaps the most important contribution he made 
was the development of the Roybal Immigration Reform Bill, 
attempting to shift the legislative debate to a positive alternative.
H.R. 4909 was introduced by Congressman Roybal on 
behalf of the House Hispanic Caucus and all those opposed 
to the violations represented by Simpson-Mazzoli.  The main 
focus of the Roybal bill was to create a more effective Immigration 
and Naturalization Service.
Instead of work-place and neighborhood raids, H.R. 4909 
advocated stepped-up border enforcement.
Instead of employer sanctions to discourage hiring of undocumented 
workers, Roybal called for stricter enforcement 
of present labor laws to remove the exploitative incentive 
of cheap labor.  Instead of eliminating judicial review for asylum 
and deportation cases, Roybal proposed a separate immigration 
board and administrative law judges to speed the 
hearing of these cases.
The Simpson-Mazzoli bill was defeated.  But there can be 
no doubt that Edward Roybal raised the level of debate in 
Congress and the nation.  He turned us away from a debate 
which played on fear and to a discussion which focused 
on principles.
The struggle for immigration ""reform"" will be back, but so 
will Edward Roybal in the 99th Congress."
Rosa Parks: In Her Own Words,Icon in the Making,"Rosa Parks Papers: Events, 1951-2005; Featuring or honoring Parks; 1984",mss859430243,mss859430243-56,completed,http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:mss:mss85943:0019:10:0056/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg,"In the case of producer/director Norman Jewison, his excellent 
moviemaking skills have brought audiences closer to the dark side 
of discrimination, both in themselves and others.  Through such 
films as In the Heat of the Night, The Landlord, ""... And Justice 
for All,"" and the recently released The Soldier's Story, Jewison has 
focused public attention on the victims of intolerance and the 
tragedy of injustice.  In doing so, he challenges audiences to reevaluate 
their own beliefs and recognize the dignity of the individual.
   Such plot lines play well on college campuses, but they often 
fare less well in other locales.  However, Jewison's carefully crafted 
approach succeeds well in both venues.  As one critic for Variety 
explained, ""Jewison often has a way of taking esoteric concepts 
and making them play in Peoria, as it were, which doesn't go down 
too well with heavy thinkers.  However, it goes down very 
smoothly with the mass audience, whose members have their 
breed and circus while being exposed to some ideas.""
   The result is a heightened public consciousness, one that goes 
beyond the labels of black and white, rich and poor, rural and 
urban to the idea of people and the rights they intrinsically possess 
for being simply people. 
   To Jewison, it is not a matter of pleasing the audience; it is a 
matter of telling the story ethically and telling it well.  ""The film that 
you present should preserve your intentions for all time,"" he says.
   But there was a time in Jewison's career when good ideas were 
not enough.  After graduating from Victoria College, University of 
Toronto in 1950, Jewison tried unsuccessfully to get a production 
job in Canadian television.  On the advice of a television executive, 
he withdrew his entire savings of $140 and headed for London in 
hopes of finding a production job there.  For two years, he lived 
hand to mouth, supporting himself with odd jobs and occasional 
employment at the British Broadcasting Company as a script 
writer of children's shows and as an actor in bit parts.
   He returned to Canada in 1952, however, when offered a job in 
the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's training program.  Jewison 
quickly rose within the company's ranks, writing, directing 
and producing some of Canada's most popular and successful 
musicals, dramas, comedy-variety shows and specials during the
seven years that followed.  His refreshing apporach caught the
attention of a talent representative from the William Morris 
Agency, who succeeded in wooing Jewison to New York in 1958 to 
work for CBS for a three-year stint.
   At CBS, Jewison became a troubleshooter, updating the ailing 
weekly television special, ""Your Hit Parade,"" and directing some 
of the network's summer shows.  When he refused to finish producing 
a summer variety show because of undue sponsor interference, 
Jewison, quite unknowingly, launched himself into a new 
career direction that was to prove his capabilities to both mass 
audiences and studio executives.  He directed a very successful 
showcase for Harry Belafonte which led to a number of other 
variety specials for performers such as Judy Garland, Danny Kay, 
Andy Williams and Jackie Gleason.  He also directed some musical 
tributes to the fifties and Lerner and Lowe.  His work garnered 
several Emmy Award nominations and awards and a growing 
reputation as an up-and-coming director.
   Disillusioned by television's constant ratings wars, Jewison left 
television in 1961 and went to Hollywood to work on movies.  In 
1963, he made his directional debut in 40 Pounds of Trouble, a 
sentimental comedy that did so well it landed him a seven-movie 
contract with Universal.
   The film was followed by three more romantic comedies and a 
growing desire on Jewison's part for more artistic control.  A 
technicality in his contract got him released from his studio obligation 
and Jewison's creativity soared.  He took over the direction of 
The Cincinnati Kid, which pitted Steve McQueen as a brash 
young inexperienced poker player against Edward G. Robinson. 
The film remains one of the screen's acknowledged classics.
   Armed with accolades, Jewison now exercised his artistic freedom 
and produced a move classic that combined with a keen 
political commentary on the absurdity of the escalating Cold War.
   Jewison's first stab at social commentary as quickly followed 
by another.  While comedy formed the basis of his appeal, a 
thriller genre was used in his second to condemn racial violence.  In 
the Heat of the Night took audiences by storm with its plot of a 
Northern black detective called into a small Mississippi town to 
help the local white sheriff solve a murder.  The conflict between 
the two law enforcers, respectively played by Sidney Poitier and 
Rod Steiger, drew high praise from major critics.  Said Bosely 
Crowther of the New York Times, ""The fascination of (the film) is 
in the crackling confrontations between the arrogant small-town 
white policeman, with all his layers of ignorance and prejudice and 
the sophisticated Negro detective with his steely armor of contempt 
and mistrust.""
   Nominated for seven Academy awards, In the Heat of the Night 
took five, including best picture, best screenplay and best actor for 
Rod Steiger's portrayal of the small-town sheriff.
   In 1970, Jewison again explored the effects and injustice of 
discrimination in The Landlord, using satirical comedy to examine 
society's reaction to interracial relationships.
   In his other movies, Jewison has examined corporations' stifling 
effect on individuality (Rollerball, 1975), corruption in the American 
labor movement (F.I.S.T., 1978), corruption in the judicial 
system (And Justice for All).  And in his latest, he has again looked 
closely and critically at the effects of racial discrimination in the 
powerful The Soldier's Story.
   The film unravels the mystery surrounding the shooting of a 
black, hate-filled Army sergeant (Adolph Caesar) on a lonely road 
outside a fictitious Louisiana base.  The film is a set in 1944, when the 
U.S. Army was still racially segregated and black troops were not 
allowed to fight in Europe.
   A black military lawyer, played by Howard E. Rollins, is sent to 
investigate the murder to see that justice prevails.  While the plot 
sounds faintly reminiscent of In the Heat of the Night, Jewison 
masterfully explores discrimination in Soldier's Story in a new 
light.  It is more than a story of black versus white; it is a story of the 
twisted hatred that can ensue from being hated.  And in that way, it 
is as Jewison says, ""not a black and white issue, but a people 
issue.""
   As audiences ponder the latest Jewison's think pieces he is off 
making another film, another statement.  He is an artist who provides 
audiences with movies that not only make the heart ache, 
but hold a mirror up, to let all reflect on what is and more importantly, 
on what can be.
   The ACLU honors Norman Jewison's deep commitment to 
social justice displayed not only in his films but in his support for 
organizations striving to bring to life the values he promotes in his 
work.

   Since its inception, there has always been a dichotomy 
between the intent of the Constitution and its application.  
Surely the spirit of the Bill of Rights, proclaimed in full force 
Dec. 15, 1791 by Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, 
called for equality for all.
   But, despite several attempts to ensure equal rights for 
black Americans--the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery, 
the 14th Amendment granting blacks citizenship and the
15th Amendment giving blacks the vote--the U.S. 
Supreme Court decisions at the time undermined the force 
of these amendments, and blacks remained voteless, 
second-class citizens, segregated by Jim Crow laws.
   On Dec. 1, 1955, 164 years to the month after the Bill of 
Rights came into being, Rosa Parks, after a hard day's work, 
boarded a crowded bus in Montgomery, Ala.  When the bus 
filled up, the driver ordered Parks to yield her seat to a white 
man.  She refused.  The driver called the police and Parks 
was taken to jail where she was booked for violating the city 
bus ordinance.  That arrest changed the course of history.
   As detailed in Stephen B. Oates' ""Let the Trumpet 
Sound: The Life of Martin Luther King, Jr.,"" Parks' arrest 
marked the first time a black had been charged for violating 
the city segregation code--""a historic blunder and the test 
case Nixon (E.D. Nixon, prominent in the Montgomery 
NAACP) had been waiting for.""  The plan was to take the 
case to the Supreme Court and to immediately implement a 
bus boycott.  Four days after Parks' arrest the boycott 
began.   Dec. 5 [MONDYY] Monday Morning
   That day also marked Parks' trial, where she was found 
guilty of disobeying the Montgomery segregation ordinance 
and fined $14, including court costs.  At her trial, along with 
Nixon, was the Rev. Ralph Abernathy and the Rev. Martin 
Luther King, Jr., who had been chosen to lead the boycott.
   It was the passion and eloquence of King which would set 
the tone for the civil disobedience action of the boycott.  But 
it was Rosa Parks' courage that ignited the movement.  At a 
rallying speech at the Holt Street Baptist Church where the 
young minister addressed thousands of people, King said, ""I 
want to say that in all our action we must stick together.  
Unity is the great need of the hour, and if we are united we 
can get many of the thing that we not only desire, but which 
we justly deserve. . . . If we are wrong, the Supreme Court 
of this nation is wrong.  If we are wrong, the Constitution of 
the United States is wrong.  If we are wrong, God Almighty is 
wrong.  If we are wrong, Jesus of Nazareth was merely a 
Utopian dreamer who never came down to earth.  If we are 
wrong, justice is a lie.""
   Although King and the coalition had made clear their 
intention to boycott transit system peacefully, they were 
met with violence, hatred and all manner of manipulative, 
psychological tricks: the war was on.
   Through it all--the epithets, the bombings, King's own 
arrest and trial, the moments of doubt--the quest for civil 
liberties remained constant: it could never be stopped 
again.
   Those acts of the late 1950s, and those that extended into 
the 1960s, such as the March on Washington in 1963, 
jabbed at the conscience of the nation and brought about 
the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act in 1965.
   It is, however, ironical that a country which professes to 
be ""one nation under God... with liberty and justice for all"" 
needed later Supreme Court decisions, citing the ""due 
process"" clause of the 14th Amendment, to apply the Federal 
Bill of Rights against the states.  It is beyond irony that a 
nation founded on the principle of freedom should be made 
to watch in horror the assassination in 1968 of a man who 
spoke only for peace, dignity and the inalienable rights of all.  
It is incredible that, 193 years after the drafting of the Bill of 
Rights, civil liberties are not guaranteed, but must be constantly 
fought for--over and over again.
   But fight we must.  And one of those long in the forefront 
of the struggle is Rosa Parks.  She accepts this, not without a 
certain amount of frustration, perhaps bemusement.  How, 
she wonders, can she have garnered all this attention these 
past 29 years for simply following her conscience--for doing 
what was right, for refusing to do what was wrong?
   Long before that historic day in 1955, Parks and her 
husband, Raymond, practiced non-violent civil disobedience.  
As far back as the 1940s [*1930s*] they fought against prejudice 
and segregation.  But it was those turbulent times, just 
on the heels of McCarthyism, that were to catapult Parks 
into the public eye and the annals of history.
   Rosa Parks has received numerous citations, plaques 
and awards for her act of courage.  She holds honorary 
degrees from among others, Haverford, Holyoke, Wayne 
State, Central State and New York University.  She has 
been honored by the state of Alaska, Bnai B'rith, UAW and 
the NAACP - just to name a few.
   Tonight she is being honored by the American Civil Liberties 
Union of Southern California.  But it is we who are 
honored.  For by her examples of courage and dignity, her 
will to be free, Rosa Parks has shown us that liberty only 
dies if we let it.
   Rosa Parks, welcome.  And thank you.

""America's Needs: A New Birth of Freedom"" was the title of the ACLU's 
Annual Report in 1954.  That was the year of Brown v. Board of 
Education, outlawing segregation in the nation's schools -- technically.  
That 9-0 decision by the Supreme Court was the end of a long battle 
to overturn Plessy v. Ferguson and five decades of official segregation.

But more than an end, it was the beginning of a new era in the struggle 
for equality.  Over a century after slavery was outlawed, the battle to 
end the moral enslavement of discrimination continues.

During the past 30 years the ACLU has played a critical role in the 
courts, in the legislatures and in the public debate on ending 
discrimination.

The Southern Regional Office was created by the ACLU in 1964 to hasten 
implementation of the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act and other 
constitutional and statutory guarantees of equality.

Working with a network of ACLU affiliates across the country, landmark 
decisions were won diminishing discrimination in schools, voting, 
housing, jury selection, employment and public accommodations.

But the victories of the past become less meaningful as the current 
Justice Department reverses the enforcement policies of the last two 
decades and affirmatively seeks in the courts the dismantling of 
programs aimed at remedying discrimination.  And many cases never reach 
the courts as access to justice is narrowed.  In a severe blow to the 
Fourteenth Amendment, the Supreme Court held that the Eleventh Amendment 
prohibits federal courts from compelling state officials to comply with state laws.

The struggle for equality received two more critical blows.  In Grove 
City College v. Bell, Title IX of the Civil Rights Act was virtually 
nullified by the Supreme Court's ruling that colleges receiving federal 
aid may discriminate everywhere but the actual department receiving the 
specific funding.  Our efforts to overturn the impact of this decision 
through passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1984 have not yet been 
successful.

In Memphis Firefighters v. Stotts, the application of strict ""last hired-
first fired"" principles to consent decrees drawn to remedy racial discrimination 
in employment creates the likelihood of segregation again becoming 
the norm in the workplace as affirmative action is undone.

But the fight is far from over.

""Freedom is never given free to anyone.""  Martin Luther King, Jr., reminded 
us of what we must do.  It is the task of each generation to 
secure freedom for the next.

America needs once again ""a new birth of freedom.""  If we are to be 
emancipated from the bonds of inequality, it will take a recommitment 
of our hearts and minds.  Together, freedom can be regained.  Together, 
freedom can be preserved.

Local News (cont'd)
Numbers and purpose are the basic substance of an
organization, and COMTO is moving up in both.
COMTO has nearly 500 members in 1984.  We can
double that in 1985 by specific outreach to the transport
industry at-large.  Plans are underway to appoint a
working task force with representation from all modes to
make recommendations to COMTO on organizational
inclusiveness, recruitment and programs for 1985.
COMTO's future lies in our capacity and willingness to
change the present and to meet the challenge of the 
future.

continued from page 1
will be announced. 
Following the business meeting, 
four concurrent workshops are 
planned. The workshops will focus 
on current issues relative to DBE, 
regional taxes, career development 
in the field of transportation and 
self-development and awareness for 
minority managers. Workshop panelists 
are nationally known experts in 
their field. Workshop panelists include 
transit administrators and managers, 
board members and state legislators. 
Also, the length of the workshops 
have been extended to provide 
more time for dialogue and 
participation from the floor. We are 
sure you will find the workshops 
stimulating as well as enlightening. 
The Saturday luncheon will feature 
Maynard Jackson, the former Mayor 
of Atlanta, Ga., as keynote speaker. 
Following the keynote address 
will be the presentation of the Annual 
COMTO Awards, which include the 
Sibling Award, the Founders Award, 
Special Awards and the Thomas G. 
Neusom Scholarship Fund Award. 
Obviously, the lunch will satisfy more 
than your appetite. 
Next will be the General Manager's 
panel, ""A View From The Top."" General 
Managers form transit systems 
across the country will provide their 
views and experiences on the operations, 
management and politics of 
their respective transit systems. The 
two-day meeting will conclude with 
our traditional wrap-up and assessment 
of the meeting. 
The meeting will accomplish more 
than recognizing minority leadership 
in transportation ""today"" - it will bring 
together the pool of ""untapped"" minority 
leadership of ""tomorrow."" We 
urge you to join us in the celebration 
of minority leadership in transportation - 
past, present and future. 
We encourage you to register early 
for the meeting due to limited hotel 
space. Friday, registrations are limited 
to 180 and Saturday, the registrations 
are limited to 300. Please

1984 COMTO Annual Meeting 
Promises to be an Historic Occasion

The 1984 COMTO Annual Meeting 
theme, ""Transportation - Yesterday, 
Today and Tomorrow,"" will be a celebration 
of change and progress, reflecting
on yesterday, experiencing 
today, and transcending the future 
with visions of tomorrow.  The meeting, 
to be held on September 28-29, 
in Washington, D.C., at the Hyatt Regency, 
will open on the symbolic note 
of the ""past crossing the present to 
the future"" with the recognition of our 
luncheon honorees - Rosa Parks, 
mother of the modern freedom movement, 
Carmen E. Turner, WMATA
general manager, and Charles Bolden,
NASA astronaut - each of whom 
has made or is making history.  The 
keynote address will be presented 
by Washington, D.C. Mayor Marion 
S. Barry, Jr., a prime example of 
minority leadership ""today"" making 
changes for progress ""tomorrow.""

Following the luncheon will be the 
Federal Update and the Job Bank 
Update.  Both sessions are scheduled 
to be brief and designed to 
provide COMTO participants with 
general information.

A Board Member panel discussion 
on ""Current Policy Making Issues in 
Transit"" is scheduled to follow the 
updates.  The panel promises to be 
exciting, diverse and informative.  The 
panel includes representatives from 
various boards around the country 
who have been active in making and 
shaping national and local transit 
policy.

The evening will include a reception 
honoring Congressman William 
Gray, III of Pennsylvania and the 
Honorable Ralph L. Stanley, UMTA 
administrator, who have been instrumental 
in assisting COMTO in its 
mission.  During the reception, you 
can indulge in fine food, drinks (open 
bar), music and networking.

The second day of the meeting will 
begin with the Business meeting, 
during which a Continental Breakfast 
will be served.  The results of the

""On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks, a 
seamstress and respected citizen of
Montgomery's black community, quietly
refused to give her bus seat to a white 
man. She herself describes the episode 
that triggered the Montgomery bus boycott 
and signalled the end of segregation 
in the South.

""I had been working during the
day at the Montgomery Fair Department
store in Montgomery. When I
left work that evening and came out
of the store I noticed a Cleveland 
Avenue bus that was quite crowded,
and when I got on the bus I wanted
to be as comfortable as I could, so I
didn't take that bus. I went across the
street to the drug store and purchased
one or two items, because I had a little
pain across my neck and shoulders
from using the press at work. As I
was coming back across the street to
the bus stop, I noticed another bus
approaching, and I didn't see anybody 
standing up in the back. But by
the time I did get to the bus door, a 
number of people had gotten on
ahead of me, and when I got on the
Negro section in the back was well
filled, and all of the seats were taken.
But there was one vacant seat in the
middle section, that part of the bus
we could use as long as no white
people wanted the seats. The rule
was that if the front section filled up
and one white person came to sit in 
the middle section, we would all
have to get up and stand in the back.
A man was sitting next to the 
window, so I took a seat next to him.
Across this aisle from us there were
two women. I was just thinking of
getting home and doing my work.""

""Of course, when I got on the bus, 
I noticed the bus driver and recognized
him as one who several years
before, oh, I think about 1943, had
evicted me from the bus because I
had refused to put my fare in the
front and go around to the back to
get in.  That was another rule that
they had, and sometimes when you 
got around to the back door the 
driver just started the bus and left 
you behind. On the third stop a few
white people boarded the bus, and 
they took all of the designated white
seats, and there was this one white
man standing. The driver just turned 
around and he said he needed those
front seats, which meant the ones
where we were sitting, in order for 
this man to take a seat. That was
segregation.""

""The four of us would have to 
stand up in order to accommodate
this one white passenger. When he
first spoke, didn't any of us move;
but then he spoke a second time
with what I would call a threat,
because he said, 'You all better
make it light on yourselves and let 
me have those seats.' And at that
point the man sitting next to me by
the window stood up. The two
women stood up and moved out
into the aisle.  I just moved my legs
for him to pass and moved over to 
the window. The driver looked at 
me and asked me if I was going to 
stand up. I told him no, I wasn't. He
said, ""If you don't stand up, I'm
going to have you arrested."" I told
him to go on and have me arrested.
He didn't exchange any more words
with me. He got off the bus, and
when he came back he stood in the 
well of the front door and didn't say
anything, but he was looking towards
the back. By this time quite a few
people had left the bus, some of
them I guess didn't want to be inconvenienced
and probably got off to
get other buses, but there were still
several people on the bus. It was all
quiet, and there were no arguments
or any type of confrontation. When
the policemen got on the bus, the
driver pointed me out and said that
he needed the seats. He said, 'The
other ones stood up.' So the policemen
approached me and asked me if
the driver hadn't asked me to stand. I 
said yes. He asked, 'Why didn't you 
stand up?' I said I didn't think I 
should have to. I asked him, 'Why do
you push us around?' He said, 'I
don't know, but the law is the law,
and you are under arrest.' So the
moment he said I was under arrest. I 
stood up. One picked up my purse,
one picked up my shopping bag, and
we got off the bus. They escorted me
to the car, and opened the back door
and I sat down. They had to wait until
the driver told them whether he
would swear out a warrant or
whether he just wanted me off the 
bus. He wanted to swear out a warrant
against me. They took me on to
the city hall, where I was booked,
and from there to the jail.""

""As we were getting in the car I
remember asking them if they would 
give me back my purse and things,
and they handed them to me, and I
got in the back seat with my personal
belongings. Of course, when I got
down to the jail, my things were
taken and held, and I had to go in to
the cell. I wasn't happy at all; I don't 
recall being extremely frightened,
but I felt very much annoyed and inconvenienced 
because I had hoped
to go home and get my dinner, and
do whatever else I had to do for the
evening. But here I was sitting 
in jail and couldn't get home.""

The Parks case began the Montgomery Bus Boycott which lasted a year and resulted in the U.S. Supreme Court
outlawing the segregation of all public facilities in the South. Her courageous action altered the course of Black
American History and changed the face of America.

MRS. PARKS CONTINUES...

Since that historic day in Montgomery, Mrs. Parks has continued her work in the Civil Rights Movement and has
received several citations for her outstanding contributions. The Southern Christian Leadership Conference sponsors
the annual Rosa Parks Freedom Award. She has received an honorary doctorate from Shaw College in Detroit,
Michigan. In 1976, Mayor Coleman Young of Detroit, renamed a main thoroughfare ""Rosa Parks Boulevard."" In 1977,
the United Automobile Workers awarded her the Social Justice Award. In the same year, she received the
Humanitarian Award from the Catholic Universities of America in Washington, D.C. In 1978, the Progressive
National Baptist Convention presented her the Martin Luther King, Jr. Award."

THE ROSA PARKS FREEDOM AWARDS

With the visit of Mrs. Rosa Parks to our City, certain persons are being recognized for their demonstrated commitment and perseverance in building parts of the Beloved Community.  The Beloved Community exists in bits 
and pieces here and there, it has happened, to one degree or another.  It BEGAN IN MONTGOMERY, under the perseverance, love, and commitment of the Mother of the Freedom Movement, on Dec. 1, 1955, and has now spread to 
many corners of the globe.

The Awards being instituted, are:
THE ROSA PARKS ""ENOUGH IS ENOUGH"" AWARD
THE ROSA PARKS EDUCATORS AWARD
THE ROSA PARKS POLITICAL LEADERSHIP AWARD
THE ROSA PARKS RELIGIOUS SERVICE AWARD
THE ROSA PARKS MOTHERS AWARD
THE ROSA PARKS GOOD NEIGHBOR AWARD

THE ROSA PARKS FREEDOM EXPRESS

The Committee for the Beloved Community has rented a bus from RIPTA, which will be the ROSA PARKS FREEDOM EXPRESS to take part in the March, on Saturday, June 30, at 9:30 a.m.  This day, this is her bus.  The driver is 
a Black Alabama brother, Mr. James Gibbons.  Her guests to ride on the bus with her, for the most part are being chosen 
by placing names in a hat, and being chosen at the COMMUNITY RALLY, Friday night at Ebenezer Baptist Church.  We 
expect the passengers on this bus, to represent members of the families of God, racially and ethnically.  By all means, get 
your name in the hat, for the Friday, June 29 drawing.

RIDE WITH DESTINY, RISE WITH DIGNITY!  RIDE WITH MOTHER ROSA PARKS.

THE MARCH FOR THE BELOVED COMMUNITY

The March For The Beloved Community will be a march against all those Jericho-Jim Crow type walls that block our 
way to a Beloved Community.  THE Spiritual ""Joshua fit the battle of Jericho, and the walls come tumbling down."" ... is 
part of the inspiration for a series of walls which have been artistically designed and drawn for the March, will be torn 
down, as part of the March.  EACH IS A WALL (1) ... of Spiritual dry rot; (2) of Apathy; (3) of abuse and neglect of our 
children and our elders; (4) of family decay; (5) of leadership and organizational in-fighting; (6) of municipal neglect; 
(7) of educational suicide and genocide; (8) of joblessness, hunger and homelessness; (9) of self-hate; (10) of the dollar 
flight; (11) of violence and against persons and property; and (12) of THINGS FORGOTTEN, UNNAMED AND UNKNOWN (that block our way to a beloved Community).

We march AGAINST all these things; we also march FOR the Beloved Community.  ""Let us MARCH ON TILL VICTORY IS WON.""

NAACP Fight for Freedom Fund Dinner
Cobo Hall
Detroit, Michigan

Greetings:

It is my pleasure and a privilege to extend congratulations and best wishes to
you tonight as you gather for the 29th Annual Fight for Freedom Fund Dinner. 
This dinner, which brings together a great ethnic, social and economic mix of
people united in the struggle against bigotry and discrimination, is vital to the 
work of the NAACP.

The 75th anniversary of the founding of the NAACP is truly cause for celebration.
Over the years, few organizations have had as great -- or as beneficial -- an
influence on our society as has the NAACP. As the foremost civil rights organization
in the United States, the NAACP and its victories in the U.S. Supreme Court, the 
Congress and state legislatures have brought about a more equal society and improved
the lives of millions of Americans.

Yesterday's victories were not achieved without a struggle -- nor will tomorrow's. 
I join with you in celebrating the 75th anniversary of the NAACP and in dedicating
ourselves to building a society based on tolerance, equality and opportunity for
all.

Sincerely,
JAMES J. BLANCHARD

You'll Love
The Quality

Get it together --Buckle up.

The vehicles pictured above represent some of the
latest offerings from Ford Motor Company, producer of the
highest quality vehicles of any manufacturer in America.*
It wasn't easy to accomplish, and it didn't happen
overnight.
Here's how we did it.

Employee Involvement
At Ford Motor Company our greatest asset is our
people.  In plants and offices, on test tracks and in meeting
rooms, Ford people are dedicating themselves to achieving
quality.  Employee Involvement groups meet regularly in
almost all Ford plants and locations throughout the United
States and are making significant contributions.  As an
example, over 500 employee suggestions were accepted for
improving the assembly process and quality of the 1984 
Ford Tempo and Mercury Topaz.

Engineered From the Driver On Out
At Ford Motor Company we're committed to building
cars of functional integrity, character and unequalled
quality that give you, the driver, real value for your money,
and then some.  Automobiles with proper steering wheel-to-pedal
relationships, spaciousness, with precision-built
instruments and controls that are functionally beautiful.
With torque and horsepower characteristics that are well-matched
to carefully selected transmission and axle ratios.
Powertrain, suspension and steering that give a feeling of
confidence and harmony, at city and highway speeds, even
on rough roads.  We call it the completely integrated
vehicle.  The driver's car.

Better Fit and Finish
The way things fit and the way things look are
pretty good indications of how well a vehicle is
made.  At Ford Motor Company accuracy and uniform fit
are checked constantly by a hand-held computer called a
Datamyte.TM  It makes sure the tolerances between doors
and body, trunk and hood conform to exact design
specifications.  And the interior design and manufacture of
the car are just as important, down to seemingly minor
details such as making sure the carpets are secure.
In addition, by utilizing advanced technologies such as
electrostatic painting, we are producing some of the most
beautiful cars on the American road.

Quality Working Relationships Improve
The Quality of Our Work
An historic labor agreement, a commitment to quality,
and a sense of pride have created a new industrial
revolution.  Ford Motor Company and The United Auto
Workers are working together like never before.  Together
we are developing more efficient assembly methods,
greater productivity, and better quality.
Take a close look at our quality and judge for yourself.
After you do you'll understand that at Ford Motor
Company, quality isn't just an abstract idea, it's very,
very real.

Continuous Improvement
At Ford Motor Company things have changed.  For the
better.  Right now, we're producing the highest quality cars
and trucks of any manufacturer in America.  And that's
only the beginning.  A tremendous investment of time,
money and hard work is producing the greatest outpouring
of new products in automotive history.  We've got a lot to be
proud of at Ford Motor Company, and yet there is still
much to be done.
We have dedicated ourselves to the task of making the
quality of the American automobile, once again, the
envy of the world.

This is the ultimate luxury.

New turbo power to move you.
The 1984 Chrysler LeBaron Convertible
moves you like you've never been
moved before. With the surge of optional
turbo power. Choose LeBaron's new fuel-
injected turbocharged engine and you
experience a 40% boost in engine horsepower
for dramatically improved performance
in acceleration and passing.
An available European handling
package provides tighter cornering at
high speeds. Front-wheel drive gives you
firm traction and control.

New electronics to keep you informed.
Compare LeBaron to other convertibles.
Compare luxury. The Mark Cross
Edition features rich leathers and advanced
electronic instrumentation. Its
graphic message center keeps you in control
with computer age intelligence. An
Electronic Voice Alert adds to your security.
Compare comfort and driving ease. A
new glass rear window, roomier back seat
and power rear quarter window are standard.
Also standard: power brakes, power
steering and a power operated top.

A 5 year/50,000 mile Protection Plan.
Compare quality. Chrysler makes the
best built* American cars. And backs them
with a 5 year or 50,000 mile Protection
Plan** on the engine, powertrain and
against outer body rust-through.
No other car in
America, Europe or Japan
moves you quite like the
1984 Chrysler LeBaron
Convertible. Buckle up
for safety.
30 EST HWY†  22 EPA EST MPG† 
Chrysler

*Based on percent of National Highway Traffic Safety Administration safety recalls for '82 and '83 models designed and built in North America. **Whichever comes first. Limited warranty. Deductible applies. Excludes leases. Ask for details at your Chrysler-Plymouth dealer. †2.2 Turbo engine. Use EPA est. mpg for comparison. Your mileage may vary depending on speed, trip length and weather. Highway and California estimates lower.

Chrysler. The best built, best backed American cars.

O'Neil D. Swanson, 
President

For 29 years Detroit's
Annual Freedom Fund Dinner
has led ALL other fund-raising
organizations of the NAACP.

And for seventy-five years
(75), the national NAACP has
had the MOST successful
and consistent record for
advancing the struggle
for human dignity of any
other organization in America.

Congratulations to ALL
for a job well done.

beers in the world were brewed over direct fire.
Stroh still brews this way.

EVERY DAY WE SET THE BEER
BUSINESS BACK 200 YEARS.

In 1981, The Stroh Brewery Company
bought one of the world's most modern and
efficient breweries for $90 million.

Then we spent $15 million to change it. 
The money went for a brand-new 
brewhouse where beer could be made by an
old-fashioned method called fire-brewing.

When the Stroh family became brewers
in Germany (before the United States 
became a nation), practically all
beers were brewed over direct fire.
Things hadn't changed much
when Bernhard Stroh started
his small brewery in Detroit.
By the time his son Julius
took over, fire-brewing
was dying out.  American brewers found they could
cut costs by brewing with steam heat.
But when Julius visited the famous breweries 
of Europe, he found the very best beers
were still brewed over direct fire.  These fire-brewed
beers tasted smoother, more aromatic.

So, he decided, his family's beer would
be fire-brewed - even though the process
was more expensive.
And still is.
Today, The Stroh Brewery
company also brews Schaefer,
Old Milwaukee, Schlitz,
Schlitz Malt Liquor and other
fine beers to the same uncompromising
standards of quality, 
in a variety of ways.

But it's the unique
character of our fire-brewed 
Stroh's
and Stroh Light
that has helped us
become the third-largest
brewer in America.
Sometimes, looking
backwards is the best way
to get ahead.
STROH
We haven't lost 
the family touch.

Stroh packaging has changed 
dramatically. Our dedication to 
quality hasn't. 

America's premier 
fire-brewed beers come 
from the copper kettles 
of Stroh."

A SALUTE TO DETROIT'S SPINGARN MEDALISTS
The Detroit Branch NAACP is proud to pay a special tribute to three of the
city's most eminent citizens:  The Hon. Damon J. Keith, Rosa L. Parks and
The Hon. Coleman A. Young, all recipients of the NAACP's prestigious
Spingarn Medal.
Given in recognition of outstanding personal achievement and commitment
to the cause of justice, these Spingarn accolades stand in testimony of
Detroit's legacy of leadership in the fight for freedom:  no other city in the
nation can claim so many Spingarn medalists among its rank.
DAMON J. KEITH
Damon J. Keith, judge of the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and
recipient of the 59th Spingarn Medal,
presented on July 2, 1974...""in tribute
to his steadfast defense of constitutional
principles as revealed in a series of 
memorable decisions he handed down
as a U.S. District Court judge ... in 
recognition of his lifetime of distinguished
public service on behalf of his city,
state, nation and, particularly, of his
race, and in genuine appreciation of
the model he has afforded aspiring
you black folk.""
ROSA L. PARKS
Rosa L. Parks, mother of the civil rights
movement and recipient of the 64th
Spingarn Medal, presented on June 26,
1979...""in tribute to the quiet courage
and determination exemplified on December
1, 1955, when she refused to surrender
her seat on a Montgomery, Alabama,
bus to a white male passenger
... her defiance of a demeaning tradition
brought about the desegregation of
buses in Montgomery, and set the stage
for the great Civil Rights Movement of
the Sixties ... in recognition of her personal
dedication since that time to the
cause of civil rights, and particularly to
the youth of the Detroit area....""
COLEMAN A. YOUNG
Coleman A. Young, mayor of the City of
Detroit and recipient of the 66th Spingarn
Medal, presented on June 30, 
1981 ..."" in appreciation of his outstanding
contribution to his country as
a citizen, labor leader, civil rights activist,
member of the Senate of the State
of Michigan and as mayor of the City of
Detroit ... for the inspiration he has
become to black youth and to other
black leaders, and for his incomparable
ability to stand by his convictions in
every circumstance ... in recognition
of his singular accomplishment as mayor
of the City of Detroit since 1973, guiding
that city from the brink of bankruptcy

History of NAACP Fight for Freedom Fund Dinner
Since its establishment 29 years
ago, the Fight for Freedom Fund
Dinner of the Detroit Branch of the
NAACP has become the largest
civil rights gala in the nation. The
annual dinner has become the finest
expression of the NAACP's commitment 
to the twin goals of justice
and equality for all people.
The Detroit Branch NAACP Fight
for Freedom Fund dinner dates
from 1956. That year, Dr. Thomas
H. Brewer, a black physician in 
Columbus, Ga., was killed in a
racially provoked murder. His death
provided the motivating force for

the first dinner, which was organized
under the auspices of the
Detroit Medical Society and the
Detroit Branch NAACP. The purpose 
of the dinner was to raise money to
end the atrocities and injustices
routinely committed against black
people. That first dinner raised $27,007.64.
Thanks to the support and
dedication of people from all walks
of life, the dinner has grown to the
point that, last year, it was able to 
raise $389,000 to support local and
national NAACP programs. In fact, 
since its founding, the gala has
raised more that $5 million, justifying
its claim as the foremost civil

rights fundraising effort in the nation 
and, perhaps, the world. Moreover,
the dinner helped Detroiters produce 
8,000 paid Life Memberships 
in the NAACP, the leading figure 
among the organization's branches
nationwide. An additional 3,000 are 
in the process of paying for memberships.
With the 1984 Fight for Freedom 
Fund Dinner, the Detroit Branch
underscores its continuing commitment
to involve people of all social, 
economic and ethnic backgrounds
in the ongoing struggle against
bigotry and discrimination.

LIFT EV'RY VOICE
AND SING
Lift ev'ry voice and sing
Till earth and heaven ring.
Ring with the harmonies of Liberty;
Let our rejoicing rise
High as the list'ning skies,
Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.
Sing a song full of the faith that the
dark past has taught us.
Sing a song full of the hope that the
present has brought us.
Facing the rising sun of our new day
begun,
Let us march on till victory is won.

Stony the road we trod, 
Bitter the Chast'ning rod.
Felt in the days when hope unborn had
died;
Yet with a steady beat,
Have not our weary feet
Come to the place for which our fathers
sighed?
We have come over a way that with
tears has been watered,
We have come, trading our path
through the blood of the slaughtered,
Out from the gloomy past, 
Till now we stand at last
Where the white gleam of our bright 
star is cast.

God of our weary years,
God of our silent years,
Thou who has brought us thus far on 
the way;
Thou who has by Thy might 
Led us into the light.
Keep us forever in the path, we pray.
Lest our feet stray from the places, our
God, where we me Thee, 
Lest out hearts, drunk with the wine of
the world, we forget Thee,
Shadowed beneath thy hand,
May we forever stand, 
True to our God
True to our native land.

GREETINGS:
On behalf of the citizens of Detroit, I send warmest regards to those 
involved in the Twenty-ninth Annual Freedom Fund Dinner of the 
National Association For The Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). 
I take this opportunity, too, to join with those who laud the NAACP 
on the occasion of its 75th anniversary.
There are not many around who were there in 1909 when a group of 
concerned individuals along with W.E.B. DuBois gathered at Niagara 
Falls in Canada for what was called the Niagara Movement. That meeting 
was the forerunner of the NAACP, and an auspicious beginning to a 
dynamic organization. Those early beginnings led to an organization 
that has truly made an impact in its relentless efforts to assure fair and 
equal opportunities for all citizens, in Detroit, as well as in  other cities 
across the country.
The Annual Freedom Fund Dinner is but one extension of the vast array 
of programs and projects which further the ideals of the NAACP. I extend 
best wishes for a successful meeting, and many more productive years 
ahead.
Yours for a better Detroit,
Coleman A. Young
COLEMAN A. YOUNG

Renew Your NAACP Membership!
NAACP   6   April, 1984


National NAACP Notes
THE CHURCH AND THE NAACP: Over the years, churches and other religious organizations have given support to the Association through the Life Membership Program.  During the year, we have experienced a continued increase.

THE MASONIC FAMILY: Units of the Prince Hall Grand Lodges, chapters of the Order of Eastern Star, Shriners, Order 
of the Golden Circles, Order of Calanthe, Daughter of Isis, as well as the Scottish Rite Masons, during the year all have 
increased their support for the NAACP through the Life Membership Program.

THE NATIONAL LIFE MEMBERSHIP COMMITTEE: This Committee was first organized in 1953, under the leadership
of the late Kivie Kaplan and Jackie Robinson, who served as Co-Chairman, along with Dr. Benjamin Mays, who was 
then President of Morehouse College.

For the past thirty years, the Committee has been increasingly effective in the growth and expansion of the Life Membership Program.  Among the seventy-odd members today, we have leaders from many units of the NAACP family, as well as leaders representing major organizations throughout the Nation.  In every case these organizations 
have been long time supporters of the NAACP and the Life Membership Program.  Included are Churches and other 
religious organizations, Lodges, Sororities, Fraternites, Trade Unions, educational and Alumni groups.  The members 
of National Life Membership Committee provide a direct link between these various groups and the NAACP and its 
effort to raise the much needed funds to help underwrite our ever expanding nationwide programs.

NEW CLASS OF MEMBERSHIP: Namely, ""THE TEENAGE LIFE MEMBERSHIP"", was approved by the National NAACP Board of Directors at its regular meeting in New York on January 11, 1982.  It is available to all youth and young adults from the ages of 14 to 20 years.  The full cost is $250.00 which may be transferred to the regular $500.00 
Life Membership.  The $100.00 already paid for a full Junior Life Membership (ages 1-13) can be transferred to the 
Teenage Life Membership.

Each month for more than two years, we received a sizable check from the American Federation of Government Employees.  Thanks to the National President, Kenneth Blaylock.  The Union is affiliated with the AFL-CIO.

THE GOLDEN HERITAGE LIFE MEMBERSHIP: This Membership was approved by the National Board of Directors on September 9, 1974.  The full cost is $1,000.00.  It is available only to fully paid regular Life Members.  The roster of the 
Golden Heritage Life Members (fully paid) exceeds 600, with a subscribing total of 1,000.  If you or your Organization 
is a fully paid Life Member, here is still another way that you can help the NAACP.  The $500.00 paid for the regular Life 
Membership cannot be transferred toward the Golden Heritage Life Membership.

The Pan Hellenic Council, whose eight constituent members, including the four major fraternities and sororities, namely, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sororoity, Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Sigma Gamma Rho, Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Alpha 
Phi Alpha Fraternity, Kappa Alpa Psi Fraternity, Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, and Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, have to their 
credit nearly 2,000 fully paid and subscribing Life Members, including Golden Heritage Life Memberships since the 
first Life Membership payment was made in 1934.  This figure does not include the personal Life Memberships held by 
hundreds of their members.

The lota Phi Lamabda Sorority and the National Sorority of Phi Delta Kappa have secured more than 200 Life Memberships since their inception.  The lotas first was in 1956 and the Phi Delta Kappa comprised of Black teachers 
and educators initiated their Life Membership efforts in 1943.

supporters of freedom from Detroit and around the nation. 
This 29-year tradition elicits words of admiration and

the value of the dinner is priceless and the NAACP Life 
Membership remains their best investment in freedom.

in Jackson Michigan; New Calvary Baptist 
Church annual breakfast; a special meeting in Lansing 
held by Michigan Bell Telephone Company and the 406th 
Anniversary Dinner of the Human Rights Department of 
the City of Detroit.

CONSUMER                   Chairperson: Agnes Bryant
""Black Dollar Day' was part of the consumer 
awareness effort for 1983. Detroit citizens were asked to 
change their money to two dollar bills and Susan B. 
Anthony coins to let merchants know how much is spent 
by Blacks in Detroit.  The Another thrust of consumer 
awareness is the National Office's ""Fair Share"" Program. 
More will be heard about this in 1984.

POLITICAL ACTION/VOTER REGISTRATION
                     Chairperson: Bruce Davis
In 1983 this committee has addressed itself to and
communicated with both State and Federal government
agencies with respect to issues dealing with affirmative
action policies and/or other policies affecting the Black 
Community. In addition to correspondence reflecting the
views of the Detroit Branch of the NAACP, petitions were
distributed and signatures obtained in order to make the
President and Legislative Body aware of the communities
stand on Tax Tuition Credits.
After the National NAACP Convention, this committee
was contacted by General Motors to disseminate information
pertaining to the availability of automotive
dealerships to Blacks and Minorities in the Detroit area.
An extensive effort was made to obtain information
regarding the case of former Mayor Eddie Cauthens in
order to determine whether or not his civil rights were
being violated.
The committee is continuing its efforts to deputize
NAACP members to register voters. This group participated
in the Underground Railroad; march; attended
various churches, college campuses, organizational
meetings and registered approximately 200 voters.

BRANCH NEWSLETTER Editor: Joann Watson
The NAACP Reporter keeps the members and
community informed of the branch activities. Circulation
is 20,000, which includes members and distribution points
in churches and the Public Library. Recent issues have
included advertising. Advertising space will be available
in the remaining 1984 issues. Sponsorship is also
encouraged. The Reporter is published quarterly with
one special edition. Volunteers are needed for distribution,
mailing, reporting, proofreading.


YOUTH FASHIONS FOR FREEDOM
Chairperson: Faye Davis
This committee was started by the late Mrs. LaClair
Knox, for the purpose of allowing the youth of Detroit to
participate in fund raising. The fashion show features
clothing for the young and a contest for MISS NAACP.
The winner is the youth reporting the largest sum of money
in memberships and donations. (See calendar)

PRESS & PUBLICITY
The Detroit Branch hosts a weekly radio broadcast
over 2 stations on SUnday: one at 7 a.m. (WJZZ) and the
other at 10:30 a.m. (WCHB). These broadcasts bring
information and list opportunities for listeners. We have
appeared frequently on television, and in the press for
NAACP events of interest. The Branch has called several
press conferences and issued press releases throughout
the year. Local coverage (radio and TV) was received at
least 60 times over the year. Four television press
conferences were conducted, and an average of two radio 
broadcasts per week.

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
Chairperson: Abe Venable
Of 52 corporations that were surveyed in 1982
regarding their affirmative action achievements, 48
responded in 1983. They are being contacted for any
additional gains in 1983.

YOUTH WORK  Advisor: Joseph Weir
They met on a month basis and are involved in
attending state legislature meetings, state and city NAACP
meetings and were involved in fund-raising activities.

DIRECT ACTION PROJECTS
The Branch participated in a mass march in memory
of Dr. Martin Luther King in Detroit, as well as Washington,
D.C. The committee was also involved in the demonstration
for El Salvador's working people. On several
occasions appearances were made in support of the Chin
case in demand of proper redress for a Chinese citizen
murdered by two whites. There were several other
occasions that the committee mobilized to support other
citizens who required organizational backing and support.

CHURCH WORK
Each year many churches join in friendly
competition with each other to see which can sell the
most NAACP memberships. A traveling trophy is
awarded to the most successful. St. John A.M.E. is the
1983 winner of the trophy.
Churches frequently take up collections for both
the national and local offices. The Branch provides
speakers from the staff and board to various church
services and programs. (See Awards)

Seventy-Five Years In The Quest For Freedom
NAACP Ministerial Committee hosts Day Long Workshop

Dr. George McKinney, of the Church of God in Christ,
San Diego, California set the tone for the worship service
and workshops.
February 25, 1984 was the culmination of many
planning sessions for the NAACP Ministerial Committee.
On that day the committee's efforts were evident in a day
long workshop with the theme: ""The NAACP and the
Church, Partners in the continuing Quest for Justice"".
Held at Bethel A.M.E. Church, thr day was both commemorative
and educational.
An atmosphere of rededication and commitment 
permeated the day's proceeding from the invocation,
keynote speaker, right through the afternoon session. Rev.
William Ardrey of St. Paul A.M.E. Zion Church gave the
invocation followed by greetings from Mrs. Betty C.
Lackey, president of the Detroit NAACP.
Bishop P.A. Brooks of the Church of God in Christ,
First Diocese of Michigan introduced keynote speaker, Dr.
George Mckinney of the Church of God in Christ, San
Diego, California. Dr. Mckinney's address set the tone for
the worship service and workshops.
Dr. Elizabeth Doles, gave the prayer followed by the
musical ministry of the Fellowship Chapel choir. After the
scripture by Rev. Odell Jones, pastor of Pleasant Grove
Baptist Church, the morning sermon was delivered by Rev.
Charles Butler, national president of the Progressive
Baptist Convention. Iman Saleem of the Muslim Temple
gave the morning benediction.
Following lunch, Rev. Norman Osborn of the host
church, Bethel A.M.E. introduced speaker Rev. Henry
Delaney, of St. John C.M.C. Church. Concurrent workshops
followed Rev. Delaney's address.
FREEDOM
IS NOT FREE!

Continuing the traditional partnership were Detroit
NAACP president, Betty Lackey and Ministerial
Committee members.

The workshops and their leaders were:
1.) POLITICAL ACTION
Rev. James E. Wadsworth Jr., Fellowship Chapel
2.) THE NAACP and THE BLACK CHURCH
Dr. Stacey Williams, Peace Baptist Church
3.)THE WORK OF THE NAACP/Past and Present
Edward Vaughn
4.) NAACP and ECONOMIC JUSTICE
Dr. Stephen Campbell Russell, Street Baptist Church
5.) THE BLACK FAMILY
Dr. Robert Dulin, Metropolitan Church of God
6.) THE NEW AGE
Dr. Charles Morton, Metropolitan Baptist Church

Appropriately so, the day's theme: ""The NAACP and
the Church Partners in the Continuing Quest for Justice""
denotes an historical partnership. The Black Church
through its ministry has always been a leader in the quest
for racial and social justice. This has been true especially in 
the past, because the ministry was immune to economic
reprisals from the foes of racial and social justice.
In civil rights history, black leaders have been
threatened with loss of job for voting, and participating in
civil rights activities.
Continuing the traditional partnership were NAACP
Ministerial Committee members:
Dr. Charles G. Adams
Hartford Memorial Baptist Church
Dr. Roy Allen
Chapel Hill Baptist Church
Dr. William Ardrey

Hi,--Mrs. Parks,
I just found out,
That you're really something
To shout about.

Heard you was the lady
That set on a bus,
That stirred up lots a trouble,
Caused all this fuss.

Heard you didn't mean it,
That you was tired,
So you set on down and rested
And lots of folks got fired.

Started up a boycott,
And messed up a town,
Tossed half of its economy
Upside down.

Started folks to thinkin',
'Bout things that they could do,
Heard tell that they's still marchin',
That you was marchin' too.

You'se sure a powerful lady--
Bet you never thought,
That when you set down on on that bus
It ever would have brought

So many of the folks you see,
Who've come out here tonight,
To tell you that they love you
For helpin' sets things right.

So may the Lord watch over you,
And many thanks from us,
For gettin' tired in Alabama,
And for settin' on that bus.

In this 102nd year of the struggle for full
freedom by more than 20 million Negro
Americans, it is refreshing to recall an incident
that may be recorded as the Genesis
of the Second American Revolution, and
most assuredly the commencement of the
Negroes' refusal to suffer further indignities
in the eyes of the free world where public
facilities were concerned.

For all of us can vividly remember the
dramatic incident of December 1, 1955, when
a quiet and yet determined seamstress
refusal to move to the back of the bus.  Her
refusal was a spark that ignited a subject
people to pursue with all vigor the unleashing
of the invisible chains of slavery and
the indignities that they had borne for almost
a century.  Mrs. Rosa Lee Parks' refusal to
sit in the back of the bus was a protest heard
around the world.  Her rejection of the so-called
Southern way of life commenced a
cycle of events that instilled new courage in
the hearts of thousands of youth across
America who echoed her sentiment in
thousands of places of public accommodations
across the land where Negroes had
felt the sting of their second-class citizenship.
Today we are fortunate to live in a tme
when we can pay tribute to this petite
woman who sat down so that we might stand
up for the freedom she longed for and fought
for as an individual.  Her incident gave new
birth and new meaning to millions of Americans
who stood up for Rosa Lee Parks and 
freedom in every city, town and hamlet
across the nation.  Today, because of Rosa 
Lee Parks and the Civil Rights Law of 1964,
there has emerged a greater share of freedom
in public accommodations in a land
long committed to the fulfillment of her
Constitutional guarantees to all of her
citizens.

Mrs. Constance Baker Motley

OUR GUEST speaker, Mrs. Constance Baker Motley, who
serves as president of New York's Manhattan Borough, has
the distinction of holding not only one of the highest political
offices in the U. S., but probably holds the topmost political
office of any Negro woman. A former member of the New
York State Senate before assuming her present duties, she
is a veteran civil rights worker. She distinguished herself as
an attorney with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational
Fund from 1946 to 1963. During that time she argued and
won nine major civil rights cases before the U. S. Supreme
Court. One of the most noted cases in which she played a
major role was that of James Meredith and the University

""I wasn't sorry,
it was just the way
I felt.""   

    In this 102nd year of the struggle for full
freedom by more than 20 million Negro Americans,
it is refreshing to recall an incident that
may be recorded as the Genesis of the Second
American Revolution, and most assuredly the
commencement of the Negroes' refusal to suffer
further indignities in the eyes of the free world
where public facilities were concerned.

     For all of us can vividly remember the
dramatic incident of December 1, 1955, when
a quiet and yet determined seamstress refused
to move to the back of the bus. Her refusal was
a spark that ignited a subjected people to pursue
with all vigor the unleashing of the invisible
chains of slavery and the indignities that they
had borne for almost a century. Mrs. Rosa Lee
Parks' refusal to sit in the back of the bus was
a protest heard around the world. Her rejection
of the so-called Southern way of life commenced a cycle of events
that instilled new courage in the hearts of thousands of youth
across America who echoed her sentiment in thousands of places
of public accommodations across the land where Negroes had
felt the sting of their second-class citizenship.

     Today we are fortunate to live in a time when we can pay 
tribute to this petite woman who sat down so that we might stand
up for the freedom she longed for and fought for as an individual.
Her incident gave new birth and new meaning to millions of
Americans who stood up for Rosa Lee Parks and freedom in every
city, town and hamlet across the nation. Today, because of Rosa
Lee Parks and the Civil Rights Law of 1964, there has emerged
a greater share of freedom in public accommodations in a land
long committed to the fulfillment of her Constitutional guarantees
to all of her citizens.

All most ten years ago, Mrs. Rosa Parks,
of Montgomery, Alabama, reached the breaking
point.  She refused to yield her seat on the 
Bus to a white man.  The bus driver ask her
to stand up, so a man could sit down.  Just
because the man happen to be white.
Mrs. Parks, refused to stand up; The bus
driver had her arrested and jailed.  That
arrest touched off a Negro Boycott of the
Montgomery bus system.
Because there were other Negroes who felt 
the same way; Mrs. Parks felt, they were
tired of being pushed around; and treated 
as Second Class Citizens.

This brought about a Negro Revolution,
which has made this World a better place to
live.  We hope to make this World a much
better place to live.

We pause tonight to pay homage to this
courageous Woman.  Mrs. Parks has made a 
great contribution to America.

This is a challenge to all of us, to
be better citizen, and to do unto others as 
we would them to do unto us.

Mrs. Parks:  ""We take off our hats to
you for your courage, and what it has done
for America; You have made this World A
better place to live.

     Rosa Louise Parks

   We are honored on this occasion to present
to a great woman--a courageous crusader
for civil and human rights. Her quiet dignity
and dynamic protest against injustice and
bigotry made a distinctive and indelible
contribution to the thought, action and conscience
of America and the world.

   Her single act of decency ignited the
integrating force that has welded citizens
together--citizens of all races, creeds and
colors, in unity of purpose and action to
secure the freedoms for all citizens, we so
valiantly defend as a nation.

   The Women's Public Affairs Committee
of 1000, wishes to express, to the co-sponsoring
organizations, and all of those
who helped in any way to make this
occasion possible, our sincere thanks for
your support of this homage to Rosa Parks.
Our gifts of substance and expressions of
love and appreciation, will indicate in a
small way, our THANKS to her for the tremendous
sacrifices made by her and her
family in the name of democracy.

   ROSA PARKS, you have made the rendering
of service to your fellowman, a
sacred trust, and in the doing, have inexpressively
enriched our lives and have given
us renewed hope and determination to bring
into fruition, freedom and justice for all
mankind.

                  SOME THINGS WORTH REPEATING
Don't think that YOU are the only ONE that can do
     RIGHT.
Don't expect anyone to beg your PARDON when YOU have
     done WRONG.
Don't try and fight or block anyone's success,. It
     might impede your own.
Don't hate anyone because of what you HEAR, give everyone
     a fair and impartial trial and when you have
     heard BOTH sides, maybe you will be in for a big
     surprise.
Don't GIVE someone a stick to crack your head and then
     get angry WHEN they USE it.

                            WHAT WE NEED

Parks, my darling:
I was so glad to talk with
you tonight.  You must have
known how lonely I was for
you.  My dear, in just a 
few days I will be back
with you, I hope never
to leave you again.

I am glad you are
better. You sounded 
very good.  It hurts me
to know you were sick
and I was not there 
to do anything for you.

I am feeling better now
than I have in a long
time.  My mind is more
at ease now that I am
coming home.

Good night, Sweetheart and
take care of yourself.

This is just a note to let
you know I am thinking of
you and I love you. I got
here all right, but had quite
a time. It was a long, hard
trip. I was very tired but
was all right other wise. It is
quite cool here after so much
rain.

There is so much work to be
done getting rooms ready for the
returning residents before school
begins. I wish you could be
here to see what it is like.

Dearest, I miss you so much.
I am worried that you may 
not take care of yourself in this
coming cold weather. Please do 
wear enough clothes and your
hat. Write me when you can.

Your loving wife,

about your being jealous because
my picture was taken with those

be, and have made you unhappy
but I would never leave
you again for a job or anything

Parks, my dear husband:
How are you? I hope you
are well and that mother 
is all right. Does she still
take her medicine? I hope she
is keeping it up. or that she
will have a doctor to check
her [there], if she isn't well.
I am sending the income

It is doubtful that I will go

a large conference this week

until commencement, there will

It keeps me so busy, that I
am very tired at night, when
I do get to rest.
My dear, I hope you are not
working too hard.  The recession
is here because people are laid
off at the ship yards.  It is not
felt on the campus, except there
is all ways something to buy and the
little money is hard to keep.  I am
not taking as much medicine as
I was, and I am eating a more
normal diet.  I still don't eat
pork or fried food, no coffee, tea
or soft drinks.  I feel better if
the ulcers don't begin all over again.

I am so sorry I missed
talking with you Sunday
evening.  I was only in the
next building working and had
left a note on my desk where 
I was, but it was over looked

FAMILY TEMPERANCE PLEDGE
HOLY BIBLE
GOD BLESS OUR HOME

WHY SIGN THE PLEDGE BECAUSE
1. Moderate drinking tends to 
drunkenness, while total abstinence
directly from it.
2. While no one means to become 
a drunkard, there is said to be over
six hundred thousand confirmed
drunkards in our country to-day.
3. Intoxicating drinks can do
no good as a beverage, and there
are always safer and surer remedies
to use in case of sickness.
4. The idea of moderation is full 
of deceit, and our estimate of the
power of our own will is usually a 
mistaken one.
5. The drinking habit is the cause 
of the larger portion of the misery, 
poverty and crime in our land.
6. Both science and experience 
prove that even moderate drinking
is injurious to health.

WHY SIGN THE PLEDGE BECAUSE
7. External interests are often forfeited
through drink, for the Bible
declares that no drunkard shall enter
heaven.
8. The Bible pronounces no blessing
upon drinking, but many upon
total abstinence.
9. It is easier to keep a pledge
publicly, solemnly given than a
simple resolution.
10. The pledge protects us from
the solicitations of friends and removes
us from the temptations of
the saloon.
11. Persons miscalculate their
ability to drink in moderation, and
become slaves to the drinking habit
before they are aware of it.
12. Intemperance obstructs civilization,
education, religion and 
every useful reform.

BELIEVING IT TO BE BETTER FOR ALL
WE,
THE UNDERSIGNED SOLEMNLY PROMISE,
BY THE HELP OF GOD,
TO ABSTAIN FROM THE USE OF ALL
INTOXICATING DRINKS AS A BEVERAGE.

I was so glad to receive 
your letter today.  I kept reading 
it over and over.  It seems 
that we should not have to 
spend our lives so far from 
each other.  Dearest, I wish 
that I did not have to be 
away from you [an? times] a

what I feel that I could

was quite well remembered
by those who knew of it.
Mrs. Phenix gave me

me cards.  I was not

stay on the milk and

realize now how you
must have felt in

to have taken a hold

much responsibility.

Dear Brother;

How are you and the family? I hope
you are all doing fine.

We are doing quite well. I am 
sorry not to written you about what is
going on here with our bus protest. It
is just so hard for me to concentrate
on writing letters.

We are really in the thick of it now.
Rev. King's home was bombed last night
while we were at the First Baptist Church
Mass meeting. His wife and baby were
in the house, but not hurt.

We were interviewed and photographed
by Life Magazine last Thursday. I hope
you get a copy. I bought an extra
copy of Jet to send you but never did
get it in the mail. We were also on
the Dave Garroway TV program ""Today""
some time ago.

I must close for now. Write soon.
Best regards to Daisy and the children.

After receiving your letter I looked over my correspondence with
my brother and the literature explaining the authorization of payment for
this allotment and find that it should have been entirely deducted from my
brother's pay as he intended the allotment as a gift to me. The error seems
to be in the accounting department's failure to deduct the allotment from my
brother's pay rather than the improper receipt of same. Under these circumstances
I do not feel that I owe the amount for which you have billed me.

It is possible that there is some confusion in my brother's name since
you only use his middle name as a reference. If you need information from my
brother you may address him at 99 Medberry Street, Detroit 2, Michigan.

I have a letter dated in January, 1945 (V-Mail) in which my brother
told me he had authorized the payment of this allotment. 

Please let me know if further information is needed.

Yours very truly,

Rosa L. Parks"

My darling husband:
Hearing your voice this morning
was such a wonderful surprise. It has
made the day so pleasant for me.
Of course it makes me want to see 
you more than ever. I should be
coming home as soon as possible
next month. You spoke as if you
are feeling well and I hope you
will continue to eat well and
take care of yourself generally. I 
think of you so much and wonder
how you are getting along. It is
not easy for me to live alone
and get along without you being
near me. Also try to keep Mother
cheered up and help her keep from
worrying.
I was so sorry to hear of Daisy's
grandmother being so ill, and that she
could not get back home before this time.
It would have been good for her to have
been able to take all or more of the
children than she did. But I suppose
she did well to take one.
I wish you could see this place
It is beautiful and we are almost
completely surrounded by water. The
campus is right on the bay. There
should be plenty fishing from the
bank and on boats.
I will try to write you more
often. I must close for now with
all my love for you all ways.
Your devoted wife,
 Rosa"

died suddenly. He had just hired a
new person, but he said he would
inquire in the colored shops for
a place for you. If you can come
to Newport News or Hampton, I could
spend my time off with you until
something else could be done. My 
room is in a building that houses

put you in a guest room at the

Dear Mother:
I hope you are still all right. 
I am fine. I was sorry to cut off 
our phone conversation, but some 
one came in to tell of a break down 
of one of the New York buses. It was 
quite a program , and a very large 
crowd of people. After it was over
nearly every one seemed to be lost,
looking for somebody else or a way
to get somewhere.  I saw several people
from Montgomery, but I never got to their
assembly place.  I hope they enjoyed
it after the long, hard ride.

I hope to leave for St. Louis today,
and will cancel some of the meetings

of course I will take a
Beating but everyone is
getting beat now.  maybe
Park will like it if he
would come up and see
it.  This is out in the
country but it is building
up fast.  and the lots
are not cheap.  This is --
gambleing on the future
developement of this area--
Well that is the lay out
so far so you see it will
take me quite a while to
make any headway.
Yes I was thinking of
leaving here hadn't decided
where I was going.

You can do your own
work this is the way I 
had it figured out.  I am
getting two lots togather
one for you and Park and
one for myself.  I am paying
cash for one $425.00  [40]
40 X 120 and get the deed
morgtage it for Material
Build one 5 or 6 room
house next Spring &
Summer and buy lot
No #2 on installment and
build another house the
following Spring and Summer
that way we would both
have a home.  if you cant come up
I will try it anyway--"

Dear Sister:
I received the letter
and check Just a minuit
ago.  Thanks, I may be making
a big mistake but this is
the only way I see out.
As I told you over the
Phone I have took option
on two lots in Inkster
Mich. with the Carver
Development Co.  This is
a new all colored community
this co. has the lots.  after the
lots are paid for they furnish
the building material
from foundation to Roof."

dry. I have exactly $320.15

this is a little less than I had last

let me know right away if you
want to take a risk, you can
get a job anytime Parks can too
plenty light work for him. Malcom
says that he tried to bring him
with him when he came.

you letters and birthday greetins from

Dear Mother:
How are you. I am still
waiting to hear from you all.
I am still getting along all right.
But not working yet. I went to
Annie Mae's and Fan's Monday. We
went to Elizabeth Park in the

night. Had a very nice time.
I spent the night and came back
here yesterday. Annie Mae has a
fine little son. She came in from
Nashville Sunday morning. Alice
Crecie has just started walking
a little.
I wrote a membership on the
train. I am sending it for you to
report in the next meeting. I was
going to get a money order, but
hadn't [had] been able to do so yet.
Tell Mr. Nixon I hope they are"

How are you and Parks? I hope
Brother and family are well. I am
quite well but very tired. We just
finished another conference, the Va. Federation
of Women's Clubs. I worked today. All the
employees under my supervision had a
holiday, and I had several guests

my records ready for the auditors.

rest a few days when I leave
here and then go to Detroit. I

My dear daughter,--am
sorry I did not get to speak
with you when Parks called
you the other night.
I hope you are well
and getting along all-right.
We are well.
of course Parks told you
about Daisy's fine son.
weighted 9 1/2 at birth.  he is
really fine.  I went to see him
yesterday.  named William
Patrick.  A letter came some
time ago I did not send it because
Parks and Brother did
not want you to be bothered
with any interview by any
one so I am sending it now.
Since he doesn't know where
you are, you wont be interedferred 
with.  don't work to hard
and write when you can.
much love from mother.

About the other matter in your

know how it could be done
without publicity.  I will still

Dear Mother: 
This leaves my doing fine.
I have had quite a stay here 
in New York. I was very glad to
receive the letters and clippings
from you. The people here are very
nice. I spent Thursday night
with Mr. + Mrs. Thurgood Marshall.
So much is going on I can't tell
it in this letter. It will have
to wait till I get home. I am
accepting the Washington, D.C. invitation
and will be home right afterward. 
I will stay here for the
Madison Square Garden Rally May 24.
I hope you and Parks are
making out all right. I am not 
staying with the Meachams now,"

My dear daughter, -
I hope you are well
and getting along al-
right. We are doing very
well. I went to the meeting
at the [Te] State Teachers College
to-day. It was the same meet-
ing that was held at the
Lutherans Church. It was
very well attended, well a-
bout 30 persons were present.
Mrs. Vonghns and I went
to-gether. We got a pick up
on Jeff Davis, and rode back
with Mrs. Treats. The meet-
ing was good and I really
enjoyed it. Mrs. Durr said
she had a letter or card from
you. Several persons ask a-
bout you. Write soon. 
Much love from your mother,

Williams the Sunday we had dinner with 
them. Laura Lipton was there too. She is the
young woman who [wh] works for the 4N.
and was at the Metropolitan Church
mass meeting, when Chris was with us.
Sat. morning Rev. Meacham and I
went to see the Statute of Liberty. We went
to the top of it, 92 stories. had to walk
12 top stories to the Crown, 168 steps.
From there I took the Subway to the
Bronx to Cousin Bea's. I had called
her Friday afternoon. I found her place
without any trouble. I spent the night
with her. She looks real well, and has
gained so much weight. She wears a
size 20 dress. Her arm is in a cast, but she is
in good spirits. She and Mr. Jones come back with me Sunday.

I am rushing now to go to the
studio to be on a radio program this
morning. I have been invited to
be on the Tex and Jinx show on
Mutual next Friday 11:00 P.M. You may hear
it on WAPX or NBC or CBS 9:00 P.M. our time.

I must close now to write more next
time. You will notice I had the wrong
number, but received the telegram from N.Y.
all right. it is 455. The name is Meacham.
Will write later. Take care of yourself. I spent
the night with Bettie in Chicago. Rosa.

I hope you are fine, also Parks. 
At this time I am all right. I took 
a cold going into  Chicago and still
have it, but it seems better. The
weather is very chilly here and it is
raining some of the time. I got a
plane from Indianapolis last Friday
morning at 9:20. reached La Guardia
Field at 2:15 P.M. I sent the Meachams
a telegram from Pittsburgh, but forgot
to include their phone number and the
flight I came on. I called her and she
told me how to come to N.Y. by bus to
the Eastside terminal where Rev. Meacham
met me. He met me and we took a taxi
to their home. I was quite tired by that time.
They do not have car with them because
of the trouble in keeping it and finding
parking space where they live.

They had several people to come in
an meet me Friday night including
Mr. & Mrs. Mezzerick, the lady we met at Aubrey

P.S. My Telegram came a few minutes after I got to their home."

different. Well, I like my job
alright for a while longer, but
this cold is making me think
about way down in Ala. We had
a little snow, I have a good
place to stay and a plenty 
to eat. My clothes are frail
and I have to stay indoors.
I will get me something as soon
as I can go to town. I went out 
to Thomas' house yesterday. They
were all fine except Loucille, She 
is kindly puny. I saw Anne
for the first time since she
came here. I also visited Mrs. Robinson
while over there. Brother
and Thomas came over for me
and Brother came back with 
me last night. The Doctor and his
wife went deer hunting about
three hundred miles up at

about a week, so I was here alone
with the baby. It was lonesome

better than the movie, and

operation yesterday. So last
night a girl called me to come
see her, she was not doing
so well. I spent part of the 
night with her, and went 
back this morning and 
stayed most of the day, she
is a little better to-day. She
had a Tuma removed
from her right breasts. 
and its very painful, but
I think she will soon get
better. Please write me again
soon and tell me all the news. 
I had a letter from Bea. Remember
me to all the (peoples) Love to the family. Mother."

My dear daughter,---How are
you and family to day?
fine I hope. I am all OK.
Also the Alexanders am still
enjoying it here & wish you 
could be here too.

I went out to Thomas'
home last Tuesday week and
stayed untill Saturday. They
have a nice place out 
there and I like it. Lucille
took me to the show one night.
and to visit some of her friends.
[while] I enjoyed my stay very
much. All the children have
grown a lots. Caroline is
just like Fran was when she
was that age, she is cute and
spoiled. Barbara is yet very
spoiled, Loretta is a little
lady and Thomas is very
quiet. Lucille talks loud
as usual. Thomas Sr
seem to be working steadily

My Dear Daughter
I Received Your letter of
may 5th.  a few days a-go and
was Indeed glad to hear from
you. and the others that go to
make up the family. and to 
learn that all was well.  and that
Sylvester was married and doing
well.  was indeed a pleasure.
Yes I wrote to sister Jessee Bell.
at Eufaula Ala first. she informed
me of Deaths of Mother Bro Robert
and George.  I also written to sister
Addie at Ozark. and inquired of
you.  she said you was still
in Montgomery but failed to
give me your street adrss. in
her first letter but did so in her
second one.  I keept thinking of
writting you. and still putting it
off.  it was in veiw of the fact
that I was over shadowed.  With
open shame.  that I and I alone allowled
the Evil spirit to lead me 
Completley out of Myself"
